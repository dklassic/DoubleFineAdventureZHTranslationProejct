1
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,704
Schafer: Hi, guys.
How's it going?

2
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,406
This is the last one
of these we'll ever do?

3
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,607
Offscreen: Yeah.

4
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,543
Schafer: Seems like
only yesterday I was

5
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,546
saying all that stuff,
sitting in this chair

6
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:46,747
that I can't
remember now,

7
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,248
'cause it's been
so long ago.

8
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,616
Offscreen: Mm-hmm, we talked
about that initial budget

9
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:50,550
in that chair.

10
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,552
Schafer: Don't bring that up.

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,860
[Laughter]

12
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,594
Yeah, it's just--
it's this one,

13
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,296
and then it's, ahh!

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:26,160
[Music]

15
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,590
Schafer: Tonight, we are going to
have a bonfire down at the beach

16
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,461
to celebrate the completion
of "Broken Age," everybody.

17
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,829
[Applause]

18
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,164
Yay!

19
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,532
Teamwork!

20
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:39,700
It started out like
a really fun idea,

21
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,368
and then it got really hard.

22
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,337
And a bunch of people
wussed out,

23
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,505
but a lot of people
stuck around to the end.

24
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:49,176
I wanna thank you,
thank you to the whole team,

25
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:52,079
and thank you everybody.

26
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,513
We're done!

27
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,149
Like, we went to the beach,
we had that party,

28
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,851
things got a little out
of control.

29
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,851
[Yelling]

30
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,856
And it's fun, it's fun
'cause it's, like,

31
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,591
not fixing things
right at the last minute.

32
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,361
We kinda had it done
in advance a little bit,

33
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,997
at least for--
for me and us.

34
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,732
Like, it was, um,
wrapped and submitted.

35
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,600
Like, we had to submit
for the disc version,

36
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,202
and that kind of actually--
it was tough,

37
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,870
but it forced us
to have a lot of stuff done

38
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,272
before the, um,
actual launch date,

39
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,442
'cause we had to have
that version burnt to disc.

40
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:28,448
And so, um...we had to time
to kind of, like...

41
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,584
adjust to the thought
of it being over.

42
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,420
Um, so, Reds  is done
and it's awesome.

43
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,656
The end.

44
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,556
Rice: It's done?

45
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,591
Oh my God.

46
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,593
That's kinda sad.

47
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:43,363
We sent review keys out
to press for "Broken Age,"

48
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,765
so there's already, like,
10 or so folks

49
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,767
that are playing
for review.

50
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,735
With the amount of time
that it's taken

51
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,570
and the amount of things
that have happened

52
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,840
in the last three years
is, uh, staggering.

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,843
And, um, it was nice to see
everyone care enough

54
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,312
to push for
a final product

55
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,448
that could be something
we're proud of.

56
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,483
Crook: Um, so yeah,
it just, um,

57
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,718
it kind of all came together
at the end.

58
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:09,022
Um...so I feel good right now.

59
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,724
Offscreen: You feel good about it?
Crook: Yeah.

60
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,659
I think it's beautiful,

61
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,661
and something that
we should be proud of.

62
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,064
Uh, I think people
are gonna really like it.

63
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,332
Russell: Yes, we're finished.

64
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,301
See, I knew it would happen.

65
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,504
And after 13, 14 years here,

66
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,672
you know stuff's
gonna get done,

67
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,575
and it'll be great
in the end.

68
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,277
It'll be all worth it.

69
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,611
Schafer: Rusty.
Russell: I'm playin' through

70
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,646
and fixin' bugs.

71
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:33,780
Schafer: Well, thanks for playing.

72
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,215
Russell: Mostly playing.
Schafer: Mm-hmm.

73
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,450
Awesome.
What do you think so far?

74
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,617
Russell: I got confused, actually.

75
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,886
As much as I played through--

76
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,254
-I was--
Schafer: That's not good!

77
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,322
Rice: It's not a
scripted cutscene,

78
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,457
so you wouldn't know.

79
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,659
Russell: Yeah, exactly.

80
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:46,860
Schafer: Excellent, did you figure
it out, or did ask for a hint?

81
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,061
Russell: I had to ask Ray.

82
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,763
Schafer: Oh...
-Oh...

83
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,032
And also, look,
it's running on, uh, iPhone 6.

84
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,467
-Thanks...
Rice: Not anymore.

85
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,469
Schafer: Not--b-but--it's a black screen.

86
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,737
Oliver!

87
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,805
Oh, spoilers for "Act 2"!

88
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,873
Okay.

89
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,508
Anyway, it's running.

90
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,376
Franzke: But, yeah.

91
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,079
As you can see, the game
is running a little thing--

92
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,115
This one just crashed,
but it does work.

93
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,117
I am extremely proud of,
you know,

94
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,718
the product the way
it is right now.

95
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,354
Um...and, yeah,

96
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,555
I hope it will stand
the test of time.

97
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,524
Schafer: And then we are
on the street

98
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,493
on April 28th.

99
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,195
It'll be awesome.

100
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,564
Um, and Anna's alive.

101
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:25,632
Look at that, everybody.

102
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,400
Yay, Anna's alive!

103
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,202
Yay!

104
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,637
Kipnis: It feels--it feels good.

105
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,707
It feels like, uh, we did--

106
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,842
we did something good
and worthwhile

107
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,111
and something
that hopefully will, you know,

108
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,848
uh, have a--
I don't know, a future?

109
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,484
Like, have a legacy
of some kind.

110
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:48,021
Schafer: I really, uh, felt good
about the second chapter.

111
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,656
You know,
I feel like it answered

112
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,525
anyone's critique
about the first one,

113
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:54,628
you know, without changing
the game completely, you know.

114
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,097
I think it definitely was,
you know, harder and longer,

115
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:00,734
and, um, and amazingly done
in less time, so...

116
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:04,137
Stoddard: I did my first full,
full playthrough last weekend,

117
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,274
and it is a hard game.

118
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,442
It's really challenging
and it's really well-done

119
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,077
and it's engaging.

120
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:14,447
Like, I've worked on this thing
for years and I still--

121
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,149
like, the story
was still getting me.

122
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,284
It's pretty good.

123
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,286
And when I hit
the final scene,

124
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:20,687
like, man, dude,

125
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,622
it's, uh...
it's cinematic.

126
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,624
It's like it hits you.

127
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,826
Definitely.

128
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,828
Um...so that felt good.

129
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,732
I just had to have
a moment to...

130
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,467
start loving it again.

131
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,736
I mean, like, I had this point
in here where, like,

132
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,605
the love I have
for this just kinda

133
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,774
got knocked out
for a few days.

134
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,475
And that was really scary.

135
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,277
That was really scary.

136
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,780
And, um...

137
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,554
It was hard.

138
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,192
Schafer: We're going to
our last stand-ups?

139
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,995
Is it last stand-ups?

140
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,663
I believe it is.

141
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,531
Hello, everybody.

142
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,066
Oh, look at the big--

143
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,500
Did we not get bagels
for the final stand-ups?

144
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,070
Crook: Ah, I didn't try.

145
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,205
Schafer: Come on!
It's our last one.

146
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,807
Get your ass off Bagel.

147
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,509
I brought this
for emotional support.

148
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,645
In case I get emotional.

149
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,347
Crook: Just keep hugging it.
Schafer: I'm not gonna get emotional.

150
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,315
Crook: Squeezing it, hugging it.
Schafer: I doubt it.

151
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,284
I doubt it.
We're not done.

152
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,852
Are we?
We done?

153
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,153
Crook: This is the last standup.

154
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,188
Schafer: You playing right now?

155
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,522
This game is so addictive.

156
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,191
Cannot put it down
for one second.

157
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:34,995
Um...this might be--
this is our last proper standup

158
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:38,498
for the full team,
but, uh...

159
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,500
don't worry, I won't give
a speech or anything.

160
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,370
And then you always have
this post-project depression,

161
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,640
which is, like, you've defined
yourself by who you are

162
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,308
by making this game
for so long,

163
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,644
and then it's over
and you're like, "Who am I?

164
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,013
Am I not the person
who makes 'Broken Age'?

165
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,515
What am I?
What's the point of it all?"

166
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,817
Crook: Before, when we were
just doing, like, a big game,

167
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,854
it would ship,
and then the whole studio

168
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,555
didn't have anything
to do for a while.

169
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,358
And every--I think every--
the whole--

170
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,826
You could kinda feel that
in the air

171
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,595
and it just kind of--
it was just--

172
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,063
it was kind of a downer.

173
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,998
And, uh, because there's
multiple projects now,

174
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,433
we can all just
jump onto things,

175
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,735
and that helps--
helps you,

176
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,104
uh, I think helps me,
get out of that.

177
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,606
And so that's why
there was a need

178
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,374
on "Day of the Tentacle."

179
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:25,645
Um, so now--
now I'm on to that.

180
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,213
Um, I'm--I hear
it's really bad

181
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,015
for people who are
leading the project.

182
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,151
Uh, but Tim doesn't--
I mean, he doesn't show it.

183
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,386
He's pretty good with hiding,
I think, his sadness.

184
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,455
But, um...

185
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,856
He's just sad all the time.

186
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,058
No.

187
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,459
Uh, but I'm sure he--

188
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,860
I'm sure it will hit him,
you know,

189
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,065
because this is three years,
uh, put into this.

190
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,232
Schafer: No, I don't get depressed.

191
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,702
I'm too old to get depressed.

192
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,670
Offscreen: Don't you have any
sympathy for all the people

193
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,406
that have been insisting
the game will never finish?

194
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,075
Schafer: I do--I do feel bad
for all the people

195
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,243
who have based
their identity

196
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,379
on the fact that I'll never
finish this game.

197
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:00,647
'Cause we'll finish it
and then they'll have

198
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,482
post-project depression.

199
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,717
If I'm not that person
who hates Tim Schafer,

200
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:04,584
who am I?

201
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,119
Excellent.

202
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,620
Thank you. Panya's
last standup, for sure.

203
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,521
Inversin: Yeah, for sure.

204
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:09,589
I'm out this week, guys,

205
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,724
so it's been a pleasure.

206
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,326
But, uh, uh, yeah.

207
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,630
Crook: Go inside, Victor.
You're next.

208
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,999
Schafer: Yeah, nice try, Victor.
Crook: There you go.

209
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,134
Romero: Almost.
-Schafer: All right, we'll miss you,

210
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,268
Panya.
Victor!

211
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,336
Crook: Yep.
Schafer: Victor.

212
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,871
Romero: I'll miss you, Panya, uh...

213
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,673
Schafer: Oh, shipping games
is always tense,

214
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:27,807
and then afterwards
there's this moment

215
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,142
where if there's
ever gonna be

216
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,643
any turnaround
in the company,

217
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,278
it usually happens
at that moment,

218
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,013
'cause people hang on
to the--they want--

219
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,582
everyone wants to finish
the project they're on.

220
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:36,616
That--so that's
usually the period

221
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,817
where people
will come and go,

222
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,352
is--is in that period.

223
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:41,653
Okay, everyone,
thanks for coming

224
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,523
to dailies
all those times.

225
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,591
It's over.
Next project.

226
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,493
Rice: Yay!
Crook: That's it.

227
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:47,627
Stoddard: Man, he's sentimental.

228
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,862
Crook: Yeah.

229
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,134
Coull: So.

230
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,669
Sad panda- I'm leaving.

231
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,737
Um...

232
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,508
What else do you want
to know about it.

233
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,677
No, I mean, um,

234
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,713
the contract was supposed
to come to an end anyway.

235
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,683
The fact that it went on
a month after was pretty--

236
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,719
pretty awesome for me.

237
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,554
You know, maybe they'll
need me again in the future,

238
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,091
but, you know,
you can't be certain, I guess.

239
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,426
Schafer: Oliver is
still cranking away

240
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,561
on the final
final versions of it

241
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,229
to get it out the door.

242
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,765
And then Oliver will be moving
back to Germany, sadly.

243
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,034
I think some of you know this;
we've talked about this.

244
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,403
Oliver is--the--
the--the pull

245
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,705
of the fatherland
is too strong.

246
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,707
He must go back.

247
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,176
Oliver wants to move.

248
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,343
He's gonna keep
working for us,

249
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,245
but he's gonna
move to Germany.

250
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,548
But he's gonna be working
on "Day of the Tentacle."

251
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,716
So you don't have
to be mean to Oliver.

252
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,418
That's the main point.
Usually when someone's leaving,

253
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,653
we make sure everyone
knows in advance

254
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,122
so that they
can be mean to them.

255
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,224
Franzke: So in a few weeks,
I'm actually going to move back.

256
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,626
So it will be interesting
to see how...

257
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,329
how much German culture has
changed since I moved away.

258
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,198
Maybe I'll feel like a complete
foreigner for a while.

259
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,833
Who knows?
I don't even know.

260
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:04,337
So, all future interviews
will have to be through Skype.

261
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,705
Offscreen: Gonna miss you, Oliver.
Franzke: Yeah...

262
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:06,773
I'm gonna
miss you guys too.

263
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,541
It's gonna be weird.

264
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,510
Schafer: I think it's--
it's been a tough time

265
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,345
because we haven't,
you know,

266
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,880
it's been a while since
we've given raises to people,

267
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,715
and so there's
other companies in the area

268
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,118
that are making a lot
of money right now,

269
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,720
and so they're able to throw
that kind of money around,

270
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,088
and that'll probably
cause us to--

271
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,723
Uh, that always happens.

272
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:27,327
We lose through--when, like,
Oculus and Facebook took off,

273
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,495
they started
throwing money around.

274
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,096
We lost some people to that.

275
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,531
Um, but after "Broken Age"
comes out,

276
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,366
we'll be able to throw money around, right,

277
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,468
'cause we'll be rich off of, uh,

278
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,504
all those point-and-click
adventure dollars.

279
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:38,638
Actually,
we don't expect to make

280
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,206
a lot of money
off of "Broken Age,"

281
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,041
because everyone
bought it the first time.

282
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,645
And, um, but the new platforms
like, um,

283
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,349
PS4 are going to be opening up
some new customers.

284
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,618
Bailey: There's a lot banking on it,
but--but not everything.

285
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,286
I mean,
we diversified

286
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,854
to do some of those
LucasArts properties

287
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:58,825
like "Grim Fandango" and, like,
uh, "Day of the Tentacle."

288
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,528
Uh, so "Grim" sales
are really good.

289
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,496
Um, you know...

290
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,260
[Applause]

291
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,836
It's, like,
$1.7 million gross,

292
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,004
which is good.

293
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,405
So, across all platforms

294
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,107
for the last week, um...

295
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,675
Schafer: I'm feelin' kinda gross.
Bailey: Yeah.

296
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,310
And, you know,
it looks like those are--

297
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,711
are gonna bring in
a lot of, uh,

298
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,080
a lot of money
for the studio, so...

299
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,715
Schafer: And I hope there's a lot
of people out there

300
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,084
who were just waiting for
the whole thing to be one game

301
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,286
and don't care
about crowdfunding

302
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,754
and they don't
wanna know about

303
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,689
our little
transparency efforts.

304
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,692
They just wanna play a game
when it's done and, um,

305
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,028
hopefully they will buy it.

306
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,231
Please join me in welcoming
Mr. James Spafford.

307
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,099
-Yay!
-Thank you, guys.

308
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,035
James Spafford.

309
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,038
Uh, would you please stand up
so everyone can see you.

310
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,440
This is James,
and rotate one time.

311
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,175
No, you don't have to rotate.

312
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,476
Uh, James...

313
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,445
uh, welcome to Double Fine.

314
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,881
So James Spafford used to be
one of the two people

315
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,250
who ran Mixnmojo, which is
an old LucasArts fan site,

316
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,586
and I knew him back then
when he visited our offices

317
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:03,756
in 2001, I think,
and gave me some Marmite.

318
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,793
And, um...and now I said,

319
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,761
"In 10 years,
we'll hire you."

320
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,064
Fifteen years?
"In 15 years, we'll hire you"--

321
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,599
as our community manager.

322
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,001
-Whoa.
-He's not the new Chris Remo.

323
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,003
He will never be
the new Chris Remo!

324
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,671
-Yeah.
Muir: 'Cause he's not dead.

325
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,508
Schafer: In other news,
Chris Remo's dead.

326
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,077
No.

327
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,779
Spafford: I mean, I'm a long-time
follower of Double Fine

328
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,648
and everything
they've been doing.

329
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:29,782
I'm a backer.

330
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,352
Uh, obviously backed immediately.

331
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,487
Um, followed
the documentary series,

332
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,290
which I'm now on,
which is really weird, uh...

333
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,192
Offscreen: Is he aware of
everything that's happened?

334
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,526
Did he know what he was
getting himself into?

335
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,829
Schafer: Don't tell him
about gamergate.

336
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,631
No, he knows, he knows.

337
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,599
That's--that's the exciting
new challenge for him,

338
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:51,104
will be, um,
rebuilding all the things.

339
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,505
Spafford: I knew what was going on.

340
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:56,209
I mean, certainly,
lots of people were not happy

341
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,044
about the game
being split.

342
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:01,814
Um...so I feel like, yeah,
that--that might've been

343
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,549
the start of some troubles.

344
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,585
But probably the start
of any community troubles

345
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,820
was the day that
the Kickstarter was made

346
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,592
and, um,
$3.5 million was raised

347
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,193
and a lot
of people's money

348
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,196
was riding on a thing
that they had in their head,

349
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,599
a vision that they had
that this thing was gonna be.

350
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:26,205
And, you know, it wasn't the way
some people wanted it to be.

351
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,741
I never want to give up
on people who are like,

352
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,009
"You know,
I'll try everything."

353
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,611
If people
are really mad,

354
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,346
a lot of the time
you can--

355
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,682
you can--you know,
you can bring them around.

356
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:39,352
There's always some way that
you can make them happy again.

357
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:44,557
Um...yeah, it's just
finding out what that is.

358
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,359
Schafer: It's--it's good timing,
'cause we're--as we're

359
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,395
wrapping up the game,
we're coming out of production

360
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,464
and getting back into all
the community-facing stuff,

361
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,399
like getting out the last
of the backer rewards.

362
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,567
Like, we still have a lot
of these little mini portraits

363
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,369
that Bagel has to paint.

364
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,371
So, like,
it's come to that point

365
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,406
where we're kind of, um,

366
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,642
closin' the loop
on the story, big story,

367
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,777
and so we'll be facin'
the backers a lot,

368
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,613
and it's good to have
a community manager for that.

369
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,054
Okay, so we're just--are we just
talking about the launch plans

370
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:18,291
for the game as far
as PR and marketing?

371
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,226
What's--what's your
marketing budget on the game?

372
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,294
Rice: Zero...?

373
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,762
Schafer: Okay.

374
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,664
Spafford: One of the big things
I wanna talk about

375
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,199
is how we talk about "Act 2"

376
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,501
and how we
properly do this,

377
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,204
like how we bring
this thing out.

378
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,206
Schafer: How do we talk about "Act 2"?
Spafford: The biggest thing, right.

379
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,741
Schafer: So just, like,
the--what's it called?

380
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,343
Spafford: Well, like, no, as in...

381
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,645
how are you getting people
to think about it?

382
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,748
You want people to think
about it as a whole game,

383
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,517
-or as episode two?
Rice: Yeah.

384
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,119
Schafer: Like, now that it's done,

385
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,787
I would like it
to just be just "Broken Age,"

386
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,622
as if we never
split it at all.

387
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,291
Rice: So, yeah, I think that the hope
was, like, a year from now,

388
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,627
the story would be more
about just the game as it is,

389
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,763
not that it was split
or anything.

390
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,798
Spafford: When it was
released, we did--

391
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,633
people did reviews of it
and stuff, right?

392
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,470
Like, treated it like
it was its own thing.

393
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,672
So I wonder how
persuadable people will be

394
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:10,243
to just forget that
and move on.

395
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,878
Rice: But I still think
we probably have to speak

396
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,379
to the people who did
already buy it, and--

397
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,314
Schafer: Yeah, because this is
a worry that I do have,

398
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,682
that people are like,
"When's 'Act 2' coming out?"

399
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,117
And that they don't
see that announcement,

400
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,519
-"'Act 2' is out"--
Rice: Yeah.

401
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,120
Schafer: Like, the answer
to that question,

402
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,189
they might miss the fact
that it came out.

403
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,791
Rice: Yeah.

404
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,560
Yeah, so I think we still
need to be saying that, like,

405
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,829
for people
who purchased "Act 1,"

406
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,330
they're getting
the full game now,

407
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,833
updated with "Act 2" content.

408
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,202
Spafford: Yep.
Rice: But...

409
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,571
Spafford: The PS4 and iOS is
definitely a really good chance

410
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:41,374
to just talk about
the whole game.

411
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:42,508
So we've been trying
to get people

412
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,676
to play the PS4 version,

413
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,813
which is a new platform, um,

414
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,381
and doesn't have
that distinction.

415
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,383
Like, it's just one game
on that platform.

416
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,551
So the more people
we can get to look

417
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,718
at that and talk
about that,

418
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,520
the more--
the more hopeful we are

419
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,822
that that can be a thing.

420
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,523
Rice: Not--not
speaking to just, like,

421
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,258
what's gonna happen
in "Act 2," you know,

422
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,860
'cause that's how
we've all been thinking about it

423
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,462
for a long time,
but speaking of, like,

424
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,564
what is this game?

425
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,165
Spafford: Looking at the full--

426
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,533
the full picture
now it's done.

427
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,569
Other than that,
we're just trying to, you know,

428
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:12,572
beg, borrow, and steal
every bit of coverage we can.

429
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,641
Rice: We were able to get a European
press tour on zero dollars.

430
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,677
Schafer: I...w-well...
Rice: So that's good.

431
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:18,778
Schafer: We're not paying
anything for that?

432
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:21,714
Rice: Um, we are paying
for three days of a B&B,

433
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,382
but they're paying
for all of our flights

434
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,285
and our B&B while we're there, so...

435
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,554
Um, I think
it's all pretty set now.

436
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:32,625
So, um, flights and hotels
and everything is in there.

437
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,728
There'll be--
basically we get to UK first

438
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,597
for the first weekend,

439
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,832
and then the Monday
after that we're doing, like,

440
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,734
a bunch of press
at Media Molecule.

441
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:47,406
Um, and we'll have Eurogamer,
Edge, and The Guardian, uh,

442
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,108
all that day
in their offices.

443
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,776
And then, yeah,
we have the talk

444
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:54,614
in Vyborg
with Peter and Ray.

445
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:14,120
[Music]

446
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,503
Spafford: We should pick a day
for having press around as well,

447
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,538
and then we can start
organizing them.

448
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,760
[Music]

449
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:29,649
Schafer: So what do you
think so far, Marty?

450
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,750
Sliva: I think it's awesome.

451
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,320
Schafer: Give us your, um,
full review now.

452
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,088
Sliva: Just verbatim, and then you
guys can write it down.

453
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:39,358
Schafer: We need to know the score
before we decide whether

454
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,193
-you're leaving the room.
Sliva: Yeah, okay.

455
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,795
Schafer: That's just a common--
Sliva: That's--that's happened--

456
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,697
That's happened before
with other publishers, so--

457
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,499
Schafer: Really? They're, like...
Rice: Oh, God.

458
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,467
Sliva: I think
it's mostly like, like,

459
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,503
"You can do an exclusive,
but what's the score,"

460
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,671
you know what I mean?
It's like, well,

461
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,239
I'm not gonna do that, then.

462
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,241
Uh, everyone
always says, like,

463
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,509
"Oh, this is gonna be
the adventure game

464
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:57,777
that gets people
to play adventure games

465
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,178
who haven't played
adventure games."

466
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,579
Like, you--is that
bullshit to you?

467
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,315
Like, is that--
is that necessary?

468
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,649
Do you think
adventure games need that,

469
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,217
-or do you think it's--
Schafer: I've always been--

470
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,385
I've always been
interested in it,

471
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,653
because it
always seemed like

472
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,221
with adventure games
that we were trying

473
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:13,092
to get beyond the--
the limited audience

474
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,527
of people currently
playing--playing games.

475
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,295
Not that they're limited,
but there--

476
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,597
there was a,
back in the '90s,

477
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,800
a small group
of the culture at large

478
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,601
that was playing
games at all.

479
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,437
And it seemed like
there are all these people

480
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,405
who weren't playing games
and they're like, hey,

481
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,674
I think you would like a game
that, well, it's about story,

482
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,509
where you don't have to worry
about getting shot in the head,

483
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,745
and, like, you could
play at your own pace

484
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,647
and it involved themes
that weren't

485
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,015
being covered in games,
you know.

486
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:38,985
So we always, you know,
we always, you know...

487
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:40,453
People would tell us, like,
"This is the only game

488
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,687
that my girlfriend
will play with me."

489
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,656
And it was--that was
always the story.

490
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,558
Like, there's all these people
out there who, you know,

491
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,226
why aren't
they playing games?

492
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,061
And I think this is the game
they would like.

493
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:52,064
But, um, you know, it's always
been hard to reach those people,

494
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,734
and, um, and make them feel
like they would like--

495
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,202
You know,
they think of themselves

496
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,870
as someone who would not
play video games.

497
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,873
It's hard to get past that
identity problem, almost.

498
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,475
Sliva: Totally.
Schafer: So I do think about it,

499
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,643
but I don't think
it's necessary.

500
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,311
Like, I think
it's good enough

501
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,812
to make a game
that people--

502
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,347
and that's what this
Kickstarter is all about.

503
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,282
Like, there are these
people who said,

504
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,151
"We like adventure games
just the way they are."

505
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,120
And they don't need
to completely revolutionize

506
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,654
with--with how
they interact.

507
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,989
They don't need to be
a different genre.

508
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,591
They just, "We like
the old adventure games

509
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,292
and we wanna play
another one."

510
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,494
And knowing
they were out there

511
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,729
and we were making
the game for them, uh,

512
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,731
is what made it
special this time around.

513
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,767
Rice: There's always been, like,
conversation coming up

514
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:31,504
here and there about how we're
gonna give backers the codes,

515
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,672
or if we're gonna
give them early access

516
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,340
to the game
or anything like that.

517
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,708
And I feel like
it's never been, like,

518
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,376
fully talked about
and decided upon.

519
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,279
Schafer: I was--I wanted to give it
just the--the day before,

520
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,714
-the 24 hours before.
Rice: Yeah.

521
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,116
Spafford: Yeah, if it's possible
without too much mess,

522
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,619
then I think that people
will really appreciate it.

523
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,020
And in fact,
we've set the embargo

524
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,222
for press
for the same time

525
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,490
as the backers
getting their keys

526
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,492
so that, you know,
everyone's getting

527
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,494
their thing
at the same time.

528
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,864
Offscreen: Yeah, 'cause the embargo
thing was such an issue last time.

529
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,734
Spafford: I think there is all kinds
of emotions about that.

530
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,636
Rice: Tim, did you hear that?
Schafer: What?

531
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:06,405
Rice: "Digital Trends"
posted an article,

532
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,742
"Why We're Breaking
the 'Broken Age' Embargo."

533
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,510
Schafer: Tell 'em maybe he
didn't agree to anything,

534
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,145
but he knows
he's bein' a shit.

535
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,748
Bailey: I was looking over all
of our news broadcasts,

536
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,517
and basically
all the exposure went out

537
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,753
when the backers got it,
like, two weeks ago.

538
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:24,757
Spafford: I think that whole situation
probably should have been done

539
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,725
a bit differently.

540
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,194
I think we learned
a lot from that,

541
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:30,496
by the sounds of things,
or at least I hope so.

542
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,765
And I've certainly
watched that episode

543
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,434
and--and thought, "Okay,
we need to not do that."

544
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,606
Yeah, so, it--today is Friday.

545
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:44,577
Uh, on Sunday night,
we're gonna send out

546
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:48,180
backer keys to people,
which is pretty exciting.

547
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,284
Um, 24 hours later,
the game will unlock on Steam

548
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,620
and be pushed out, uh,
around the world

549
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,290
onto however many millions
of platforms that we're doing.

550
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,560
Um, so by Tuesday,
uh, morning

551
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,362
when we all come
into the office,

552
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,664
the game will be out,
everyone will be playing,

553
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,467
no one will have any problems,
everything will be fine,

554
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,202
and everyone will be
having a good time.

555
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,571
That's--that's the gist of it.

556
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,673
Hansen: Flawless.
Franzke: What could go wrong, right?

557
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,642
Hansen: Yeah, don't say that.

558
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:17,676
Rice: It's all gonna be perfect.

559
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,112
Hansen: It--it may not be perfect.

560
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,381
Rice: Um, all right.

561
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,283
All right.

562
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,484
Let's put out
the Kickstarter update?

563
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,719
Spafford: Let's do it.

564
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,622
Schafer: Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

565
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,825
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

566
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,665
Hi, everybody.

567
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:40,866
Hello, hello,
thank you for waiting.

568
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,536
Thanks for--
sorry about the delay.

569
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:44,703
It's still so interesting,

570
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,038
Melina just magically
appears there.

571
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,640
Hello, Melina,
nice to see you.

572
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,474
Awesome, awesome.

573
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,576
Okay.
Hi, everybody.

574
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,511
Uh, today I've been
very preoccupied

575
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,347
'cause "Broken Age" is
in the hands of our backers

576
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,883
and people are playing it,
which is amazing!

577
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,318
Yeah!

578
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,987
Offscreen: Do you wanna look
at the forum right now?

579
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,389
Schafer: Okay.

580
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:05,124
Let's go to the forum,
shall we?

581
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,226
"Spoiler: Need hint urgently."

582
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:08,494
Ah! Ah!

583
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,528
Take that, right?

584
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,629
Right?

585
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,731
Where's the general...

586
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:16,468
"Let's talk about how much
we love the game" thread?

587
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,636
Let's see.

588
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,605
Discussion and feedback.

589
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:20,706
"I finished this morning.

590
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,774
What an incredible game!"

591
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,008
That's all I'm gonna read.

592
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,743
That's it.

593
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,580
"Everything about 'Act 2' has
improved the game dramatically.

594
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,181
The puzzles are
a lot more detailed.

595
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,683
Required me to pull
out a notepad."

596
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,384
Yay.

597
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,886
That's nice.
I'm glad it makes--

598
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,554
I get excited when
I pull out a notepad.

599
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,756
"I liked 'Act 1,'
but it was a little linear.

600
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,458
'Act 2' is perfect.

601
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,260
And to Tim and everyone
at Double Fine,

602
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,028
I really appreciate you
and what you've done so much."

603
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,263
Well, that's nice.

604
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:45,464
Ah!
The game's out.

605
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:46,732
I mean, it really
comes out tomorrow,

606
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,601
or midnight tonight.

607
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,569
But it's out,
the review embargo is lifted,

608
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,571
we got a 9.2
from "Game Informer,"

609
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,707
and it should be good
for launch,

610
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,642
official launch day
tomorrow,

611
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:59,612
where it'll be out on all
platforms and everywhere.

612
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:01,747
Um, so now we just sit around
and read reviews

613
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:04,316
and pretend we don't
care about 'em.

614
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:07,286
That's the...regular thing.

615
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:08,621
I'm gonna sit there,
like, all night

616
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:09,989
just waiting for them
to come in.

617
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:11,523
You see one, you're like,
"Oh, that--

618
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:12,691
that was awesome!
I'm gonna read one more!

619
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,826
Oh, that was bad,
I'm not gonna--

620
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:14,994
not gonna read any m--

621
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:16,829
Oh, that one was nice!"

622
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,631
And then it all evens out.

623
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,299
I just was reading, like,
two different reviews,

624
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,301
one talking
about being too hard

625
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,470
and one being,
it's too easy.

626
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,772
And, uh, you know,

627
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,607
that just seems to be
the way with those games.

628
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,076
They're just, like, um...

629
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,345
people--people
react strongly

630
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:37,316
and very subjectively
and, um...I don't know.

631
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:38,651
Like, I feel like it takes years,

632
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,653
almost, for people
to really decide

633
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:43,455
how they feel
about these games.

634
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,791
So 10 years from now we'll
find out if it was any good.

635
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,626
Offscreen: It seems a bit strange
that there's review scores

636
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,662
for "Act 1," "Act 2--"

637
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,063
And the whole thing.

638
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,465
Schafer: Yeah, it's a mess...
it's a mess.

639
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,833
Never split
your game in half.

640
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,402
Rice: By the way,
there's a lot of people

641
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:57,636
talking about it,
so that's good.

642
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,405
Um, and tomorrow
we're partying,

643
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,307
and I think I sent an invite
out to everybody.

644
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:04,276
So, bar crawl, I think we're
just starting at Victory Hall,

645
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,511
'cause it's close
and we can walk there,

646
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:06,679
and then we're gonna go--

647
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,547
Schafer: And then the hardcore.
Rice: Chinatown.

648
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:12,351
Schafer: To people who care about
history and wanna relive history

649
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:14,553
through the bars
of Chinatown and beyond.

650
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:17,589
Rice: So, tonight at 9:00 our time,
midnight Eastern,

651
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,658
is when all the other
platforms will go up.

652
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,194
Bottle Opener: In the name of Lars Halford,
open up!

653
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,529
Franzke: Okay, so we've
got Ouya lined up.

654
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,798
I guess we just need
to press that button.

655
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,166
Rice: The button?

656
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,867
Uh, Spaff figured out
some way

657
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,070
to wire this weird
Divekick button...

658
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,572
Spafford: It's not that weird!
Rice: ...to launching the game.

659
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,875
-Cheers.
Franzke: Well, cheers to you guys.

660
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,578
Spafford: It's okay, we're
toasting the five--

661
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,413
four-minute
countdown

662
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,015
to pressing the
blue button.

663
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,717
Do you want the blue pill,
or the yellow pill?

664
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,552
Rice: Oh my God,
everything explodes.

665
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:48,520
Franzke: The game gets deleted,
obliterated from the server,

666
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,055
so don't press
the yellow button.

667
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,224
Spafford: All the money
is refunded.

668
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,695
Franzke: The code gets
unwritten, the art unmade.

669
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,131
Rice: Yep.

670
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:00,632
Spafford: What are we gonna do
for four minutes, you guys?

671
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,569
We could read Twitter
for a bit.

672
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:04,636
Spafford: People are really happy.
Rice: The reviews have been

673
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:05,738
-really good.
Spafford: Yep.

674
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,606
Rice: Just, like,
the way they describe

675
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,808
the puzzles
and the writing,

676
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,276
it makes it--
makes it feel like

677
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,578
people actually
really got it,

678
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,413
-which is nice.
Spafford: We should get ready,

679
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:16,815
because we're about
to--to go into...

680
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,118
Rice: Let's do it, you guys.

681
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,120
Spafford: You should.
Franzke: Okay, Greg,

682
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,454
It's hovering
over the button.

683
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,555
Rice: You do this one.
Franzke: I do this one?

684
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,057
This is Steam;
this is the big one.

685
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:27,626
Rice: I know. You do this one.
Franzke: All right.

686
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:28,761
Spafford: Press the "Okay" button!

687
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,029
Franzke: All right, here it goes!

688
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,196
It's live on Steam.

689
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,598
Rice: Yay.
Spafford: Oh, my God.

690
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,266
Rice: Okay.
Spafford: All right, next one.

691
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,467
Franzke: Okay, here's iOS.

692
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,336
Spafford: Oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God.

693
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:39,204
Rice: Oh, man...

694
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,506
Franzke: All right, here, Spaff.

695
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,040
Franzke: Spaff, you do
the OS X App Store.

696
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,308
Spafford: Release this version.

697
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,043
Franzke: Release!

698
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,645
I'll do Ouya.

699
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,646
Rice: Yep, there you go.

700
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:48,747
You're in that one.

701
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,315
Spafford: Ouya's live?

702
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,483
Franzke: Waiting--yep.
Spafford: Okay.

703
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,584
Franzke: Just Google Play.

704
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:53,786
Rice: Okay, wait,
is this the last one?

705
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:54,987
Franzke: Yeah.
Rice: Let's all do this one.

706
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,221
Franzke: Okay.
Ready?

707
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,190
Rice: Final build,
one, two, three, go.

708
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:05,840
[Music]

709
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,109
Franzke: But, yes,
this is my last, I guess,

710
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,178
full day in the office,
one could say.

711
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:22,347
Not that I'm actually gonna
do any work, but, um...

712
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:25,384
Today is "Broken Age"
launch day, officially.

713
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,219
Uh, so lots of parties
lined up.

714
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:28,554
I am just gonna pretend
they're all for me,

715
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:30,322
for my leave--for one
of my leaving parties.

716
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,624
Uh...but yeah,
it's--it's weird.

717
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,626
It's weird.
What is that? Oh.

718
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,495
Oh, because we don't
actually need this anymore?

719
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:39,832
That's true, I guess
I don't need to talk while--

720
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:41,700
Brr!

721
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,101
There's that.

722
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,575
All right?

723
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:51,343
Rice: We just put out the new
trailer, so we're trying to, like,

724
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,579
spread those around, um...

725
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:55,013
Offscreen: Elijah Wood?
Rice: I did see that.

726
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,615
So Elijah
just tweeted, like,

727
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,484
thirty minutes ago
about the game.

728
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:00,285
Right there, see?
Boom.

729
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,587
Yay, Elijah.

730
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:03,789
Like you see right now,
we're at, like,

731
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,791
twenty-five or so
on the list.

732
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:09,561
Um...and then the hope is
that that'll start going up,

733
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,196
so, by a couple things.

734
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,031
One is, we can
check and see now

735
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,266
if it's getting featured.

736
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,300
Okay, so there it is.

737
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,835
Yay.
So this showed up.

738
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,303
So this'll help,
especially since it's on sale.

739
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,538
Um, that's always nice.

740
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,473
On Steam people see
that sale number.

741
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:26,578
We do get daily Android
and iOS sales.

742
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:30,382
PS4 probably won't, uh,
give us any kinda inclination

743
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,451
for, like, a week or so,
maybe, um, maybe more.

744
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:34,486
Spafford: They're the most
interesting ones, I think.

745
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,088
Rice: Yeah, that'll be
interesting, 'cause it's new.

746
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,290
Um...brand-new sales

747
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,026
and it's reviewing well
there and everything.

748
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,795
So, uh, I think we'll have
a better idea in, like,

749
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,831
a couple weeks
across all platforms,

750
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,700
but we'll at least have
an inkling of what to expect,

751
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,038
um, from the ones
that we can see soon.

752
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,173
It's just, those are the ones
that we've already been out

753
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,376
and being sold on
for a while now,

754
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,144
so it's hard to say.

755
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,312
That's it.

756
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:01,647
Congrats.

757
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:03,615
Schafer: Uh...

758
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,217
Yeah, yeah.

759
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,020
Rice: You're so excited.

760
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,388
Schafer: Yep.

761
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,622
Phone voice: Press one.

762
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,991
To send a voicemail,
press two.

763
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,660
Schafer: I don't know what hap--
why it did that there.

764
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,094
Phone voice: Home screen.

765
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,798
Schafer: Oh, man.
Rice: Okay, all you'll do is say

766
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,300
"Green," and then "Okay."
Kipnis: Green and then--

767
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,001
Schafer: You press "Send"
to accept the call.

768
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,203
Rice: Yeah, this is an old phone,
old-school phone.

769
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,538
Kipnis: This is a really
old phone, yeah.

770
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,640
It's--it's a burner we got?

771
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,542
Greg: Yeah.
Kipnis: Is this what drug dealers use?

772
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,010
Rice: Yes, it's a drug dealer--
Schafer: Oh, I got a voicemail.

773
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,478
Okay, okay.

774
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,380
Phone voice: Home screen.

775
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,482
Kipnis: I love that it announces.
Rice: All right, can we start?

776
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,451
Schafer: A hint line--we're talking
about doing a hint line,

777
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,820
getting a burner phone
and just making it a number

778
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,089
that people
can call for hints.

779
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,657
You're supposed
to say, "Action."

780
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,493
Maybe talking to me...

781
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,362
Hm.

782
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:51,797
I'll probably just be
getting people angry,

783
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:54,766
people calling to chew me out
about "Spacebase."

784
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:58,070
Here's a hint:
Go buy someone else's games.

785
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,672
Hi, and welcome to
the Double Fine Hint Line,

786
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,374
which we have had
for a long time,

787
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,142
but no one's ever called,
it's weird.

788
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,345
Uh, but we're answering calls
today for "Broken Age,"

789
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:07,713
'cause today is the launch
of "Broken Age"!

790
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,247
Phone voice: Call one.
Schafer: Oh, we got a call!

791
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,649
Hold on, everybody.

792
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:13,652
Hello, Double Fine Hint Line,
can I help you?

793
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:14,987
Phone: Uh, hello, is this Tim?

794
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:16,088
Schafer: This is Tim.

795
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,255
How are you doing?

796
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,523
Phone: Oh m--oh, my God.

797
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,859
Hello, my name is,
uh, Steve Kaufman,

798
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:25,163
and I just wanna say,
you are the greatest developers

799
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,199
in--in history,
basically.

800
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,533
Schafer: Oh, that's so nice
of you to say!

801
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,502
-Oh, that's lovely!
Kipnis: Wow.

802
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,604
Phone: Uh, I was really
happy as a backer

803
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,206
to see it all come together.

804
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,508
Schafer: Aw, thanks for backing.
Phone: So, I love it.

805
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,510
Yeah, um, and I actually
have a legit--

806
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,379
like, I need a legit tip.

807
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,547
Schafer: Okay, all right,
that's why we're here.

808
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:43,649
Kipnis: Wow, this is
really working well.

809
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:45,150
Rice: There's a lot of people--

810
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,585
Schafer: Hello, Double Fine
Hint Line, can I help you?

811
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:49,221
Kipnis: Maybe some--some
asshole would call in and just say

812
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:52,524
really mean things to us,
live on the stream.

813
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:54,259
But it was, like,
the opposite.

814
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,561
It just, like, it completely
blew our expectations,

815
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:00,499
in the similar way that
seeing the game get funded did

816
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,833
on that first day.

817
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,368
It made you feel
like the world

818
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,703
is a much better place
than you thought it was.

819
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:06,138
Schafer: Bye.
Phone: Goodbye.

820
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,373
Schafer: What a lovely fellow.
Lovely fellow.

821
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,508
-That was spoiler-free.
-Yeah. There we go.

822
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:12,244
Spoilers:
Uh, our backers are great.

823
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:13,845
Phone: This is Emory Biloski
from, uh,

824
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,313
Israel calling,
actually.

825
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,049
Schafer: You're calling
from Israel?

826
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,550
What time--
what time is it there?

827
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,851
-Isn't it super late there?
Kipnis: Shalom.

828
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,554
Phone: It's, uh, it's like 1:30
in the morning.

829
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:23,989
Schafer: Shalom.

830
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,724
Hello, Double Fine Hint Line,
can I help you?

831
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:26,825
Double Fine Hint Line,
can I help you?

832
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,527
Rice: Blowin' up, blowin' up.

833
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:30,729
Schafer: Hello, Double Fine
Hint Line, can I help you?

834
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:31,830
Phone: Oh, shit.

835
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,465
Uh, hi.

836
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,500
Schafer: Language!

837
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,568
Kipnis: Yeah, it was just--

838
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,136
it was a really
pleasant surprise,

839
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:40,439
like, just how lovely
everyone was

840
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,407
and, like,
how fun that whole day--

841
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,544
that whole day
was really amazing.

842
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,145
Spafford: That's it.
We're done.

843
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:50,215
Kipnis: Yay. That was--
that was a great last call.

844
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,584
Rice: Well, we might turn
the phone back on later.

845
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,419
Kipnis: Really?
Rice: So, you never know.

846
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,456
Schafer: While we're hangin' out,
just out in the bar later?

847
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,691
All right, let's get
this good time over with.

848
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,159
Woo!

849
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,494
Nothing seems to happen
until I stand up

850
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:03,862
and get
everyone's attention

851
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,030
and then say thank you
to everybody.

852
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,264
I've made so many toasts.

853
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,467
Peter McConnell's here, everybody.

854
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:09,768
Peter McConnell.
Nice to see you.

855
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:11,169
Thank you for all the excellent
music in the game.

856
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:12,637
McConnell: Well, thank you.

857
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:13,572
When you've worked
on something

858
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,640
for--for
a good long time,

859
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,342
you know, over two years,
you know,

860
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,644
two and a half for me,
three I think for the--

861
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:24,616
for--for the--the
team at large, um,

862
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,419
uh, it's hard not to be,
you know,

863
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,221
a little misty-eyed
about it.

864
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,723
It's-it's like getting
to the end of the game,

865
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,726
when you play the game, um,

866
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,429
where--where
you have to, um, say,

867
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:38,797
oh, well, you know,
these characters

868
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:42,067
have become my friends
and--and now I have to say,

869
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,435
you know,
goodbye to the story

870
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,170
and goodbye
to the characters.

871
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,773
And so there's a certain
amount of sadness, I guess.

872
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:50,776
And--and, uh,
certainly, um,

873
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:52,310
you know,
there's a little relief.

874
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,613
It's always nice to be--
actually to say,

875
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,448
oh, finally, you know?

876
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:59,584
Um, you know,
but there's also that,

877
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,187
oh, well,
you know...

878
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,256
I mean, that's...

879
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,792
that's like, uh...um...

880
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:09,561
It's, uh,
an--an era, you know?

881
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,496
A really big project
like that,

882
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,666
you love like--like a--
like a child.

883
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,668
And, uh, letting it go
out into the world

884
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,504
is a--is a--
is an emotional moment.

885
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:20,705
Schafer: Call me if you need any hints.

886
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,274
If you need any hints,
give me a call.

887
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,508
All right.

888
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,477
Now, then...

889
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,620
[Gasps]

890
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,583
Agh!

891
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,300
[Laughter]

892
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:37,556
That's what you get
for being cute!

893
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:40,659
TV: Oliver, safe travels
and best of luck for the future.

894
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:44,262
And everybody else,
stay awesome, stay strong,

895
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:46,431
and find joy in the things
that you do.

896
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,465
-Bye.
Schafer: Bye!

897
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,567
Kipnis: Aw...

898
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,135
Wow.

899
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,269
Schafer: Awww.

900
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,504
TV: "Broken Age" got released...

901
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:53,805
Kipnis: Oh!

902
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,507
Schafer: Majus!

903
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,876
TV: I'm so happy for all of you.

904
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,811
Congratulations.

905
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,013
You finished
this work of art,

906
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,715
and now everybody
can see and play it

907
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,184
and it's wonderful!

908
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,580
[Laughter]

909
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:13,592
Struggled with problems
and obstacles.

910
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:16,394
Ups and downs

911
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,597
are a normal part

912
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,566
of the whole project.

913
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:24,102
And you should
embrace that.

914
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,470
It's part of it.

915
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:30,442
"Broken Age" is made
out of the ups and downs.

916
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:35,413
I am really emotional
right now.

917
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,616
I wish I could talk to you
for real right now.

918
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:41,887
And hope I see you again
soon in the future.

919
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:44,256
And, uh,
let's make more games.

920
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:48,560
Let's show the world
how the sausage gets made.

921
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,862
And, um, yeah.

922
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,464
I love you guys.

923
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:53,732
Crowd: Aw!

924
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:56,101
TV: And...yeah.

925
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:57,602
Let's, uh,
let's--we--we'll--

926
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:00,338
we'll talk in person,
so let's not do this.

927
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,240
[Laughter]

928
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,642
Schafer: Let's not let
this get weird.

929
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,076
TV: Bye.
Bye.

930
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,044
I love you.

931
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,479
Crowd: Bye, Majus!

932
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,647
Schafer: I mean,
crowdfunding was so great,

933
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:09,813
and is so great
in a lot of ways.

934
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:12,483
Like, it's--the--the, um,

935
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,185
the relationship you have
with the community

936
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,087
and the--
and the nature of the money

937
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,489
is so, um, perfect
for what you wanna do,

938
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:22,326
do something creative
and--and community focused

939
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:25,096
without worrying
about ties to people

940
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,665
who might wanna try
to influence your game

941
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:28,166
because they
gave you money.

942
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,702
Um...it's--it's weird

943
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:33,170
because it just happened
to time out--

944
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,673
it happened to coincide with
a weird phase of the Internet

945
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:39,244
where everyone's super angry
all the time and it just, like--

946
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,346
it was hard to be
that open and transparent

947
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:42,781
and give everybody--

948
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:45,350
It's like we opened up
a little tray of,

949
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,319
you know, bludgeoning
instruments so that--

950
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:49,254
for people
could beat us up with.

951
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,523
And then people picked 'em up
and just beat us up with them.

952
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:53,224
And we're like, huh, that was
an interesting experiment.

953
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,592
We probably shouldn't have
given all those weapons

954
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,761
to all the people who are mad.

955
00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:00,565
But, um, if that had not erupted
at that moment, you know,

956
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,833
maybe I would've thought--

957
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,435
'Cause at the beginning,

958
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,403
the transparency
was nothing but, like,

959
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,673
um, hugs and, uh,
high-fives all around.

960
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,276
Like, everybody at our--
you know, our PAX meetups,

961
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,544
like, that was our
community experience,

962
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:13,812
was everyone just
telling us how much

963
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,413
they were excited
about the game

964
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,082
and how much they loved us
and everything.

965
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:21,052
And then when we announced
the change in the schedule,

966
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,088
just all that--
just people just--

967
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:24,556
it seemed like there was
a big crowd of people

968
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:26,591
just ready to--
just really super mad.

969
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:30,495
And if you Google, like, um,
"'Broken Age,' broken promises"

970
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,430
on the Internet--
which I do every night--

971
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,499
if you Google that, you'll see
all these angry articles.

972
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,501
Not just from, like,
random people on Twitter,

973
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,536
but, like, these journalists
who are like,

974
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,572
"They really let
everybody down with this

975
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,207
and they should
really be sorry."

976
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:43,708
And, um...

977
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,443
and here we are at the end

978
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,379
and we're shipping the game
and it took a long time,

979
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,547
but it's everything
we said we were gonna do.

980
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,549
Uh...and I want to mail

981
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,518
all those people
individually and be like,

982
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,520
"It's time for you to
apologize about that article."

983
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,988
But I don't think they
feel like they were wrong.

984
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,557
I think they feel like--
that we still really messed up.

985
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,226
But, um, I don't.

986
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,194
I feel like...

987
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,296
I feel--isn't it great
to know I've learned nothing?

988
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,132
But I feel like...

989
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,380
[Laughter]

990
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:12,670
I feel, like,
officially that--

991
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,472
I feel like I just need to make
an official announcement

992
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,141
that I don't apologize
for anything,

993
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:18,043
because I feel really good
about it.

994
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,644
And if we had shipped
one day earlier,

995
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,146
the game would've been
one day buggier.

996
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:23,815
And, um,
if we had shipped the game

997
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:26,317
that the original
$3.3 million paid for,

998
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:27,619
it would've been small.

999
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,654
And I like the game
that we made instead,

1000
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,122
and we put a lot
of our own money into it,

1001
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,291
and I think I'm really,
really happy.

1002
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,793
This is the game,
this is what the game

1003
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:37,595
kinda said that it wanted
to be, about this size,

1004
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,030
and we did a really
good version of it.

1005
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,666
And so I don't apologize
for anything.

1006
00:36:41,920 --> 00:37:35,880
[Music]

1007
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:38,857
Raz: He makes me laugh.

1008
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,558
"And that's why
it's called a game."

1009
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,360
Schafer: Yay!

1010
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:47,400
[Applause]

1011
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,134
That's awesome.

1012
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:52,504
Uh, even though
you like basketball...

1013
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:55,340
Burbank: We all have our faults.

1014
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,474
Schafer: That's awesome.
Well, yes.

1015
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,642
Well, that's awesome.

1016
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,677
Now, uh, congratulations, Gabe.

1017
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,246
No speech?

1018
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:02,747
Gabe: No.
Schafer: Okay.

1019
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:05,617
Oh...one more thing.

1020
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,585
We have boxes
of "Broken Age,"

1021
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,087
actual boxes
of "Broken Age,"

1022
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:11,990
and we have enough
for everyone here to get one!

1023
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,091
Ryken: It's under our seat?

1024
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,292
Schafer: What?

1025
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,827
Look under your seat...

1026
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:19,130
and that'll give me time
to open this box.

1027
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,600
Offscreen: Now that this is
wrapping up, like,

1028
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,303
how do you feel
about the whole experience?

1029
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,606
Schafer: I wish I really knew
right now if I could say 100%

1030
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,742
what I learned
from all that.

1031
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:35,680
'Cause some of it's still,
you know, uh, too soon.

1032
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,549
Like, uh, 'cause there's
this part of me that's like,

1033
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:39,117
I just wanna
not tell anybody

1034
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:40,385
about what we're
working on right now.

1035
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:41,686
Like, I feel
just kinda, like,

1036
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,254
so exposed that
I just wanna be--

1037
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,256
I just wanna have some
secrets for a little while,

1038
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,759
just as a kinda
break from that.

1039
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:50,128
I had a pleasant trip
down memory lane

1040
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:51,629
making an adventure game,
but I remembered

1041
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:52,764
how hard
they are to make.

1042
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:54,599
And, um,
I don't think

1043
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,568
my next game will be
an adventure game.

1044
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,736
I wouldn't say I'd never
make one again.

1045
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:01,306
But in the end, I really--
I really think the team

1046
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:02,640
put together
a beautiful game,

1047
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,076
and that's what
I'm most happy with.

1048
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,344
'Kay.

1049
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,512
Now, this is
gonna be awkward

1050
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,480
in case
this came out wrong.

1051
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,586
This is a little light.

1052
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:15,687
That's a different game.

1053
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,322
What?

1054
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:20,525
Whoa,

1055
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,693
-look at that.
-Beautiful.

1056
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:22,794
It looks beautiful, okay wait.

1057
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:24,162
I don't believe it.

1058
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:25,330
The design of this
was supposed

1059
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,631
to have Vella
on the bottom,

1060
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,600
'cause her hair is
touching the logo.

1061
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,634
Not that I'm gonna complain,

1062
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:32,003
'cause it's really awesome.

1063
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:33,671
Okay.

1064
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,306
I--I just have to demonstrate
before you leave.

1065
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,441
This is fantastic.

1066
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:37,542
Let's see if it works;

1067
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,345
I've never tested this before.

1068
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,780
Gah, no,
it doesn't work.

1069
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,148
Gah!
Nope.

1070
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,651
Let's see,
how does it actually--?

1071
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:49,320
Okay, get rid of this.

1072
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,522
Whoa...

1073
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:52,624
Very cool.

1074
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:53,491
And that, and that?

1075
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:54,592
See?

1076
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,227
And then, oh...

1077
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,495
I want everyone
to do that

1078
00:39:57,495 --> 00:40:00,331
when you get your copy
and fix it, okay?

1079
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,620
[Applause]

1080
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,673
That is kinda funny,
we did Kickstart this thing

1081
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:11,242
and now it's actually
a box in my hand.

1082
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,844
Well, that pretty much
ends this documentary.

1083
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,646
And...scene.

1084
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,014
I really hoped
when it came out

1085
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:17,548
people wouldn't
forget about

1086
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,584
how it was funded and just
kinda talk about the game.

1087
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,085
But it seemed like
every review had to talk

1088
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,320
about
the development story,

1089
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,554
and so that was
part of the lore

1090
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:24,856
for a long time, still.

1091
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:28,059
So I hope, um,
five years from now

1092
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,494
when people talk about
adventure games,

1093
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,229
they can look at it as
just an adventure game.

1094
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:33,231
And so I think it'll be
remembered well,

1095
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:35,199
and people can
just kinda get over

1096
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,468
the crowdfunding part
of it.

1097
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,671
Kipnis: I--to be honest with you,
I'm not really sure how

1098
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:42,473
this whole thing is gonna
be looked at in the end.

1099
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,842
Um...

1100
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:47,812
I--I guess, like,
everyone has hopes for, like,

1101
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,314
a game when it comes out,

1102
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:53,451
and I had certain
hopes that, um...

1103
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,820
maybe were not fulfilled,
necessarily.

1104
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,823
And, uh, and it has more
to do with just, like,

1105
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:02,827
I really hoped people
would love the game.

1106
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:05,430
Um, and it's not to say
that they didn't,

1107
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,598
but I kinda just, um--

1108
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:12,570
I think there--there was
a lot of controversy

1109
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,605
surrounding the game
and the company

1110
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,574
that I wish
hadn't been there.

1111
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:20,611
Like, I just wish it was...

1112
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:21,579
I don't know.

1113
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,047
Annable: It was a long,
hard road,

1114
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,148
and it was
very public,

1115
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,249
and I feel like
there were

1116
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,218
a lot of things
that changed.

1117
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,520
Um, and they
weren't necessarily

1118
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,991
just because of "Broken Age"
and its visibility.

1119
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:36,060
I think the company
is a different company now

1120
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,795
than it was
three years ago,

1121
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:41,599
and I'm trying
to still figure out, why?

1122
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,501
I don't know,
are we just older?

1123
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,537
Offscreen: Do you have any expectation
of "Broken Age's" performance?

1124
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:47,872
Annable: I don't know.

1125
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,841
Bailey: And then...uh,

1126
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,376
talking about sales
of "Broken Age,"

1127
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:54,545
so, uh, sales on Steam,
we had a feature spot.

1128
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,347
Um, it acted
more like an update

1129
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,383
than, like,
a--a new push.

1130
00:41:58,383 --> 00:42:01,152
Um, however,
we got a feature on Apple,

1131
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:03,988
which is doing really well;
about $25,000 a day.

1132
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:09,160
Um, and then we also have,
um, sales for, uh, Sony.

1133
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,596
PS4, we had, like,
$100,000 worth of sales,

1134
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:12,563
uh, over the weekend.

1135
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:13,631
And it just got featured,

1136
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,766
so, uh, that's cool.

1137
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:16,601
Schafer: My expectation--
my expectation

1138
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:17,769
of "Broken Age"
in the end

1139
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:19,570
would just be to break even.

1140
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,072
I know it was kind of
always like a Kickstarter,

1141
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:22,707
like, you plan on it--

1142
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,443
Like, it's--the risk is gone
of losing money on it,

1143
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:27,612
so you know you've broken even
if you just make the game

1144
00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:28,813
to that amount of money.

1145
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,448
But we made it, like,
twice as much,

1146
00:42:30,448 --> 00:42:32,583
almost, as we got in, or more.

1147
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:36,454
And so, um, we will just
about make that back.

1148
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:38,589
And the biggest change
is that we don't need

1149
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,358
the publishers anymore, 100%.

1150
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:41,759
You know,
it used to be, like,

1151
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,795
there was no money in the world
outside of publishers.

1152
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:45,596
And I think crowdfunding's
here to stay.

1153
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:48,499
I think it's, um,
hopefully gonna grow.

1154
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,802
And in my dream--
my dream world,

1155
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:52,770
it would be big enough
to fund AAA games

1156
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:58,109
and it would be the way that
we fund all games going forward.

1157
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:00,244
So now when we're
talking to a publisher,

1158
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,379
the deals are better.

1159
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:02,847
We're asking
for less money,

1160
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:04,849
but we're also not entirely
dependent on them

1161
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:06,584
to make payroll next week.

1162
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,519
We're not like,
"Please, we just--sign us.

1163
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,089
We'll--we'll sign anything,
we just gotta make payroll."

1164
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,523
It's like, okay,
you gotta kick us in the teeth

1165
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,358
once a month
and all this stuff.

1166
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:17,662
And now we only have to take
good deals with people we like.

1167
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:19,096
So we still work
with publishers,

1168
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,666
but, um, it's different.

1169
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:24,502
Because we're 100% in control.

1170
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,872
Annable: Yeah, we're not...

1171
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:31,476
we're not rollin'
in millions of dollars.

1172
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:32,877
I--I don't know
if that would

1173
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:35,880
necessarily make
us happier, though.

1174
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,483
Schafer: You guys are the best.

1175
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:40,485
Thank you for all
your lovely audio.

1176
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:41,853
And thanks for your beard.

1177
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:43,488
Stoddard: It's kind of a milestone.

1178
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:46,791
I think there's a--
there's a few things in general

1179
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:50,127
around gaming that
"Broken Age," like,

1180
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:54,499
really kinda did a push
towards a new area.

1181
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:56,634
And I like that.

1182
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,102
Um, there's a whole bunch
of stuff,

1183
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,871
like, we could've done differently

1184
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,473
and, like, we definitely
fell down in some areas.

1185
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,308
But, like, so what?

1186
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,843
Like, that's how you--
that's how you go forward.

1187
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:08,179
Like, if you never fail,

1188
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:10,014
then you just
aren't learning anything.

1189
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:13,284
You're just...
being boring, really.

1190
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,554
Franzke: I think it was
a huge success.

1191
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:19,290
Without this project,
who knows?

1192
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:22,727
Maybe Kickstarter would have
never been the prime platform

1193
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:25,229
for, you know,
crowdfunded games.

1194
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,465
I think it made it possible
for a lot of other people

1195
00:44:27,465 --> 00:44:31,002
to--to work on
their dream projects,

1196
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:33,404
so that's--that's pretty cool, yeah.

1197
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,006
So overall, you know,

1198
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,474
I couldn't be happier,
I really couldn't.

1199
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:39,243
And, you know,
the other day, um,

1200
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:42,446
the other day I went to just
a random technology store

1201
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:46,017
here in Germany,
and--and we just, um...

1202
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,252
walked by this little thing.

1203
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:52,189
So, just have--to see this
physical manifestation

1204
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,258
of all the work that,
you know,

1205
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:57,562
went into--into this game is,
like, super awesome.

1206
00:44:57,562 --> 00:45:00,231
Schafer: Hey, Ray! Good job.
Crook: Has the soundtrack in there.

1207
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,199
Schafer: Oh, I forgot to mention,
it has the soundtrack in there.

1208
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,601
Crook: I mean, I guess we did
accomplish what we wanted to,

1209
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:05,503
which was to do this game.

1210
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:08,773
And we--and we did that,
and we--and we finished it.

1211
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:10,608
I think what we did do
that was the--

1212
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:14,612
that I think was the most
beneficial to everybody

1213
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:18,049
was that we kind of
cracked things open

1214
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:21,819
and we let people look
inside of how things work.

1215
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:26,090
And this maybe will help them
to see how things--

1216
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,492
uh, how difficult,
uh, it is,

1217
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:32,496
and how we're kinda lucky
that anything even comes out.

1218
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:35,299
Like, that any video games
actually get finished, um,

1219
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,467
is kind of a miracle.

1220
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:37,501
And--and so that's good.

1221
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,804
I hope that--
that helps...

1222
00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:42,673
I--I hope that helps people
who are fans of video games

1223
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,208
and like playing
video games,

1224
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,377
it just helps them
understand

1225
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:49,080
and have a little bit
of empathy towards, uh,

1226
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,616
those of us who are
in this industry.

1227
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:54,452
Um...you know,
we're lucky to be in it,

1228
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:57,855
and I--you know,
I'm grateful to be in it, um,

1229
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,824
but it's not
always easy,

1230
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:01,826
and--and it's--
and I'm glad that

1231
00:46:01,826 --> 00:46:03,527
we were able
to show that to people

1232
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,364
in--in an honest way,
so it's kinda neat.

1233
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:08,199
I mean, if Double Fine's
not around in 10 years,

1234
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:12,403
let's just, say, um--
it'll always be rem--

1235
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:13,804
like, it's out there now
forever, right?

1236
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:15,706
Once it's on
the Internet, um,

1237
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,208
it'll always be there.

1238
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:20,044
And so...so...

1239
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:23,614
Double Fine
will always be...

1240
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,882
...around.

[Music]

1242
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,761
Stoddard: I think it was
very positive.

1243
00:46:36,761 --> 00:46:38,062
I think there was
a lot of stuff

1244
00:46:38,062 --> 00:46:39,163
that we really
did contribute

1245
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:40,598
to the games industry.

1246
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:42,233
And...uh,
and there's a lot of stuff

1247
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:45,369
that we sidestepped and,
like, misstepped.

1248
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,405
And we're trying
to learn from that, too.

1249
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:50,574
So, um,
considering all that,

1250
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:53,344
I--going back and playing
the actual game,

1251
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:55,346
I actually think
we did really solid work.

1252
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:58,849
And I actually
think it's, um...

1253
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:01,719
I think it's
a really good game.

1254
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:05,189
I haven't really seen many
reactions that are just blasé.

1255
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,458
Like, it--it's usually
a strong reaction,

1256
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,859
one way or the other.

1257
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:14,765
And to me, in any art form,
that's great.

1258
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:18,202
Like, that means that
it's provoking something.

1259
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:21,472
And I think that's
what this is about.

1260
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:23,607
If, like,
we did three years of work

1261
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:26,143
and there was all these
trials and tribulations

1262
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,612
and at the end
somebody just went, "Meh,"

1263
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,815
like, that would be crushing!

1264
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,150
But it hasn't been like that;
it's been the opposite.

1265
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,519
Like, it's either
really, really good

1266
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,556
or really, really awful
or, you know,

1267
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:41,592
very, very vocal,
no matter what.

1268
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:43,761
Great.

1269
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:45,796
Then we did our job.
