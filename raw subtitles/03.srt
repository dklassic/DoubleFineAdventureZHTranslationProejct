2
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,953
Schafer: You know you got drunk
when the next morning

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,860
you're just starting to think of
things that you said, no.

4
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,113
I have this memory
just walking down the street

5
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:36,973
yelling and screaming the entire time.

6
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,740
Schafer: I love Chinatown.

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:50,880
[Music]

8
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,340
Schafer: Did you see
how many pages I got done?

9
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,560
So far I've got actual writing.

10
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,580
This writing paid for by Kickstarter.

11
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,760
So, it's a book. It's coming along.
We came up with a code name.

12
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,840
Do you want to ask questions
or should I just start talking?

13
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,120
Rice: DF adventure. Budget.

14
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,900
Schafer: Budget? We need that.
We might not need that.

15
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,880
I think we can have food.

16
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,100
Launch event.

17
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,033
I hate to cut the launch event.

18
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,560
That much for PAX Prime really?
Rice: Um hm.

19
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,494
Schafer: I mean that,
we might not need that.

20
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,300
Let's just say if we're being
really bare bones on some of this stuff.

21
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,460
Rice: We're cutting so
much stuff right now.

22
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,079
Rice: Ah, it's the things that like...

23
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Schafer: Greg thought of...
Everything I thought of is in.

24
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,212
Everything Greg thought of is out.

25
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,486
Rice: Yeah. So I was being
really conservative on like

26
00:02:11,486 --> 00:02:15,681
trying to figure out stuff outside
of just paying the members of the team

27
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:17,180
that we might need to pay for.

28
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,346
And some of that stuff
might not be necessary.

29
00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:22,214
So it's...

30
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,480
Schafer: Well, it's tight for me.

31
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,973
I mean, it's tight for
me in terms of like

32
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,586
the number of people
we have on the team.

33
00:02:27,586 --> 00:02:29,806
Like I wish we had more programmers.

34
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,674
So if we did that.

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,740
So if we cut out all those,
some of those things,

36
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,020
we'd have like another $100,000,
which would be um...

37
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,240
some programmer time.

38
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,740
Rice: Yeah.

39
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,780
Schafer: OK. All right.

40
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,180
And then we have how long
to actually make the production.

41
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,740
'Til next November.

42
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,040
Next November's like infinity far away.

43
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,320
Rice: It's pretty far.

44
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,427
Schafer: We could do eight games
in that time. It sounds so long.

45
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,306
Cut to November.

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,800
What? The game isn't started yet?

47
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,540
Wait.

48
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,500
Done with that.
We're in Alpha, oh.

49
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,633
November this year?
Rice: Yeah.

50
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,560
Schafer: We can't do that,
it's crazy. That's insane.

51
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,060
We're starting in November next year.
Rice: No.

52
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,060
Schafer: That sounds good.

53
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,459
Rice: That would be a year and a half.

54
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,540
Schafer: November this year,
oh, that's much closer.

55
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,800
Rice: I mean that gives us uhh...

56
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,540
five,
five whole months of production.

57
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,040
Schafer:
Five whole months of production?

58
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,980
Oh my God.

59
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,413
Schafer: Well,
I'm in an interesting position now

60
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,520
because I'm running the company
and I'm running a project.

61
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,453
So on the one hand I'm just,
I'm equal to the other project leaders

62
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,661
and I can't really abuse my ability
to like pick up resource up

63
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:44,959
and put them on a different project.

64
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,859
But I do when they're not looking,
so that's fine.

65
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,640
All for the good of the project.

66
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,406
Team Member: Ostensibly,

67
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:55,900
we going to take somebody off your team
to put them on DFA.

68
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,026
And you're going to be short-handed.

69
00:03:58,026 --> 00:03:59,787
Schafer:
I mean when you're project leader,

70
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,386
you have to kind of fight for your team.

71
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:02,847
I mean, it's a fight for resources.

72
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:04,707
And you care about the company overall
but you still know that

73
00:04:04,707 --> 00:04:08,200
to make your game good you should
get the best people on it.

74
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,733
And so you kind of,
you have to do a little recruiting.

75
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,040
You have to talk to them, you know,
outside of meetings and stuff and be like,

76
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
hey, are you interested?

77
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
I think we know you'd be,
this would be a good opportunity to you.

78
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,406
You could, you know, you'd be moving up
or you'd be taking on more responsibility

79
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:23,267
or we're doing this really cool kind of art
or something like that.

80
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:25,587
Get people excited about it.

81
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,860
And mostly we just said that
we're doing this project

82
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,393
and most people like
Anna and Brandon, you know,

83
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,734
mentioned to me they
wanted to work on it.

84
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,740
Dillon: I mean I was big gamer
when I was a kid.

85
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,106
But like adventure games were always
kind of special to me in particular.

86
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:43,167
The fact that I wound up, you know,

87
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:45,593
in a configuration where I could get to
work on an adventure game with, you know,

88
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,701
with my favorite
adventure game designer.

89
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:50,161
It's just crazy and still
kind of mind-boggling.

90
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,967
Schafer: And because the
schedule is so tight on DFA

91
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:58,947
and it's got such a small budget,
that's, that is a bit of worry, too.

92
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,600
Offscreen Voice: Holy shit!

93
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,500
Schafer: I'm nervous, though.
Offscreen Voice: Why are you nervous?

94
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,480
Schafer: 'Cause I really
want Brandon on the team.

95
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,547
And so do the other teams.

96
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:24,906
So if he does something really awesome,

97
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:28,834
I'm just going to get sad
if we then don't get him on the team.

98
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,040
Dillon: So basically over the weekend
I just wanted to prototype some tools work.

99
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,640
Schafer:
Me, too. I just had, it was Easter.

100
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,320
I didn't get around to it.

101
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,240
Dillon: This is how I celebrate Easter.
Schafer: It's beautiful.

102
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,720
Dillon: So I'll show you
my super-awesome adventure game here.

103
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,753
Schafer: Oh my God.

104
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,480
Schafer: I didn't know
you could draw. Incredible.

105
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,420
Dillon: Yeah, yeah.
And I feel like we're basically done.

106
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,993
Schafer:
Yeah, we just got to art this up.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,133
Dillon: And so like I started with
the classic data editing thing,

108
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,574
which is walk boxes.

109
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,713
And so like got a little,
you know, a walk box here.

110
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,680
Schafer: Ah, that's crazy.
Dillon: Like look how accurate.

111
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,580
Schafer: Right. Now click on the outer space there.
Dillon: It's fine.

112
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,720
Schafer: Let me see this.
Let me see this.

113
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,986
Dillon: Oh, you're breaking the illusion..
Schafer: Oh, crash.

114
00:06:15,986 --> 00:06:17,866
It was a really good puzzle.

115
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,193
Brandon is a genius
and a great programmer

116
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,600
and also someone
who has like a deep love,

117
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,633
a deeper understanding of the
low level systems required

118
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,640
but also a real affinity for adventure
games and tools and pipeline.

119
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,940
Dillon: So like this is honestly the
stuff that I'm most excited about, right.

120
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,507
It's like, you know, coming up with
a tool chain for everybody to use,

121
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:42,633
where like, you know, whatever crazy idea that
Tim has, we can get it into the game

122
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,707
as quickly as possible and actually
see whether or not it works.

123
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:50,000
And tune it up so that it can be
as good as it can be.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,040
I like being behind the scenes.

125
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,980
Schafer: That's crazy, OK. Programming
is actually happening, on the game

126
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,160
All right, you guys.

127
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,440
Awesome. That's cool.
We're actually doing actual work.

128
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,900
Schafer:
I Probably should go design it now.

129
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,406
Dillon: It's really nice to
just get something on the screen

130
00:07:10,406 --> 00:07:13,167
and like that's always the first
step to, like it's very clarifying

131
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:16,793
to, you know, have stuff present
and actually interactive,

132
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,800
because then it's easy to figure out
what to do next basically.

133
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,120
Rice: Oliver.
Franzke: Hello!

134
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,340
What have you got, man?

135
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,280
Franzke: It's pretty cool.

136
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,000
Rice: This is the game?

137
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,481
Franzke: It's kind of a game.
Rice:  Oh nice! Walking in 3-D space.

138
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,200
Franzke: Well, it's like
scaling it vertically, but that's,

139
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,280
that's pretty much how we're going
to do it in the final game as well.

140
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,600
Rice: So all these are
flat planes and you're just

141
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,520
scaling the size of the character?

142
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:58,920
Rice: And then we've got Oliver and
he's doing a lot of system work on the engine

143
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,620
and getting the engine kind of in shape.

144
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,360
Franzke: Well I was born in Germany
of course i'm from Germany.

145
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,266
In fact, from East Germany.

146
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,800
So because of historic reasons
I can be here today,

147
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,300
otherwise I would probably be
in Moscow right now, I guess.

148
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,333
I'd probably follow the people that work
in the industry, like from a young age,

149
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,640
you know, I always was playing games
and was interested in the medium.

150
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,307
It's certainly kind of
strange to be here now,

151
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:26,433
to actually write adventure
game from scratch.

152
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,700
It's kind of cool, I guess
it's what a lot of people

153
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,500
in the gaming industry
kind of dream about

154
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,820
and would love to do and it's kind of,

155
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,980
it's awesome to be here now at this time

156
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,679
and like be able to be
part of this project, for sure.

157
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,899
It's very exciting.

158
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,579
I should probably mention that
this is not the final game,

159
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,080
so please nobody
freak out at this point yet.

160
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,480
Schafer: You know, I've never
worked with Oliver before directly.

161
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,100
He's worked on Once Upon a Monster.

162
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,433
And it's funny, he worked on the special edition
of Monkey Island back at Lucas.

163
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,140
Also he's German.

164
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,660
Franzke: And if I have time,
which would be awesome,

165
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,826
like to actually dialogue system so you
can initiate like a dialogue with some...

166
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:09,426
some other thing in the world.

167
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:13,399
Kipnis: So what we're looking at
is an implementation of that,

168
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,900
of a dialogue sequencer.

169
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,460
We have this database of lines.

170
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,894
So i'm just using that
to test out my system.

171
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,960
So I wrote this little test dataset
that the red bots

172
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:26,866
are going to insult each other with.

173
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,946
And so, yeah, let me show you
what it actually looks like when you play it.

174
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,847
My friends had Nintendo and that was,
that was the best for me.

175
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:40,507
Like I remember I played
a lot of Super Mario Brothers.

176
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:45,399
And I mean, that kind of
blew my mind at the time,

177
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:49,200
because when I was growing up
I was kind of the oldest kid.

178
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,466
And I would come up with games
to play with everyone else

179
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,799
to entertain them and stuff.

180
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:00,399
And I realized when I played
Super Mario Brothers

181
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,919
that this was kind of the same thing.

182
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,354
Like someone made up like this
like little world for other people

183
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,626
to experience and to see.

184
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:11,387
And you didn't even have to be there;
And it was just like magical.

185
00:10:11,387 --> 00:10:13,580
It was like magical technology
where I can do this stuff

186
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,400
that I had been doing as a child.

187
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,667
That was like my dream.
I got my dream job somehow, basically.

188
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:22,367
Schafer: And she,
Anna's been implementing my dialogue

189
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:25,161
longer than anybody in the world.

190
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:27,781
What the hell is that sound?
[siren in background].

191
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:29,281
That happens every Tuesday at noon.

192
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,720
It's not Tuesday. It is Tuesday.

193
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,320
You know, you hear this robot voice?

194
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,040
Where's the robot voice?

195
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,540
Oh.

196
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,940
[faint distorted voice in background].

197
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,980
You can barely even hear that.

198
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,300
What if that was saying
"get out of the building"?

199
00:10:47,307 --> 00:10:48,733
I don't know.

200
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,580
It sounds like,
like our government has been shut down.

201
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,120
You are all loyal servants of the...ok

202
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,413
so I was saying,

203
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,487
I mean no one's had to implement more of
my dialogue ever than Anna,

204
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:02,646
probably because she's been doing it
since Psychonauts.

205
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:06,207
And hopefully on this game, I mean she's...
I haven't written a lot of dialogue yet,

206
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,566
but she already knows kind of
what I'm going to write structurally.

207
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:12,146
And so she's already writing
the systems to implement that.

208
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,020
Rice: So then we've also got Lee Petty,
who is the art director.

209
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,100
Petty: It's kind of hard to
tune for unless you have...

210
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,000
Rice: This is the old one
and this is the new one.

211
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,566
Petty:
That's the old one?

212
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:26,246
Rice:
This is the old one, yeah.

213
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:27,340
Petty: That's a little different
than I remember it.

214
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,880
Petty: I've pretty much been in
the game industry since 1996 constantly.

215
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,620
I was at Accolade for about five years.

216
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,520
I worked on a variety of projects there,
some of which shipped,

217
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,953
some of which didn't.

218
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,227
I actually was cursed.

219
00:11:39,227 --> 00:11:40,486
I don't remember how many years,

220
00:11:40,486 --> 00:11:42,247
but I think it was like
my first three years in the industry,

221
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:44,107
everything I worked on was cancelled.

222
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,100
It was like, ahhh.

223
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,666
I can't get a single game on my resume.

224
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:53,186
Luckily games didn't take three years
to make each back then, right?

225
00:11:53,186 --> 00:11:54,306
Schafer: Yeah,
Lee's been here for a while.

226
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:56,646
He was, came in, in
the middle of Brutal Legend

227
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:58,106
and took it over and made it look good.

228
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,520
He's been in the
industry for a long time.

229
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,933
I think if you look at
him you can see the,

230
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:06,600
it's a wear on his face
from the games industry.

231
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,566
No, he's worked on the games
for a long time.

232
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:10,726
He knows, he knows everything.

233
00:12:10,726 --> 00:12:12,454
He's, you know, he's
run his own projects.

234
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,193
He ran Stacking all by himself.
I didn't get involved in that at all.

235
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,580
He wrote the dialogue for it.
He did everything.

236
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,420
So we're lucky to have him
on projects for a little while.

237
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,960
I'm trying to figure out whether
we can steal him for good or not.

238
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,121
But there's so many other things
we need him to do.

239
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,680
Don't let him see this footage,
though, 'cause he'll ask for a raise.

240
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,880
Rice: Yeah. We're starting
to get like a team on the game.

241
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,546
Schafer: This is the nightmare team
from hell, you guys.

242
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,800
You've never seen
a sicker, crazier team.

243
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:44,233
Petty: I'm getting Wi-Fi
but it's not connecting to the Skype.

244
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:45,833
Did you, you signed
out on purpose, right?

245
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,700
Rice: Yeah, because it went away.

246
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,000
Petty: Yeah, I don't
know what's going on.

247
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,960
Skype server seemed like
they're having issues.

248
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,560
Schafer: OK, this is the first stand-up.
Isn't it exciting?

249
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,327
We can't do it without Bagel.
You can't get Bagel?

250
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,340
Rice:
Internet's being weird.

251
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,506
Kipnis:
Should we just call him?

252
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,900
Schafer: Bagel,
we're having troubles with Skype.

253
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,400
Can we just speaker-phone you in?

254
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,240
Bagel:
Yeah, let's do it.

255
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,940
Schafer:
OK, we're doing it.

256
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,340
Rice:
Is that all the way up?

257
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,507
Schafer:
That's as loud as it gets.

258
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:13,787
Say hi, Bagel.
Bagel: Hey, everybody.

259
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,040
Rice: And then we've also got,
we've always had Bagel on,

260
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,907
doing like concept arts and backgrounds
and stuff like that.

261
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,193
But now we've got an art director
on the project

262
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,100
that'll actually start trying to
take those images that Bagel has made

263
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,434
and figure out how to actually
get them in a game

264
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,520
and get them to be like
working game assets.

265
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,754
Schafer:
Bagel Stapley, Nathan.

266
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,653
Stapley: Buddy.

267
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,060
Schafer: Look at that baaaaaaa.
Lee Petty is here.

268
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,280
Petty:
What's up, Bagel?

269
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,780
Schafer:
Lee Petoir is here.

270
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:44,166
Stapley: Can you hear me?
How is it?

271
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,266
Schafer: Yeah. I can hear you,
can you hear me?

272
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:47,266
Stapley: Yeah, I can hear you.

273
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:49,853
Schafer: Oh, man.
I haven't paid my property taxes.

274
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,627
So embarrassing.

275
00:13:51,627 --> 00:13:53,720
So one of the main things
I want to do is pick

276
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,300
what you're going to paint
for Lee to mess with in after-effects.

277
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,347
Stapley: Yeah.
Schafer: Remember that? Stapley: Yeah.

278
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:02,073
So is that how we're going to do it?

279
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,046
Like I'm thinking of layers basically.

280
00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:08,841
Petty: The goal is just to get
like a type of environment, you know.

281
00:14:08,841 --> 00:14:11,906
Like maybe it looks like something
that the player could walk,

282
00:14:11,906 --> 00:14:14,234
kind of left or right
and have it scroll or into.

283
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,140
Kind of either one we could explore.

284
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,673
Schafer: Right now he's taking,
you know, Bagel's work

285
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,080
and Bagel's not a very technical person

286
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,980
so he just paints
these awesome paintings.

287
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,020
But then making it actually look good
in the game is a whole different thing.

288
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:34,460
And so we've got Lee working on actually
making that a realized game playing world.

289
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,360
And it's really fun to
see them working together,

290
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,327
because they're so different
but they're putting together this, I think,

291
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:41,220
awesome looking visual style.

292
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,760
Schafer:
There's a lot of cabins in here.

293
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,660
Petty: Hey, that'd be a good one, Tim.
That cabin.

294
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,760
So if you wanted the player
walk into the screen there,

295
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,080
like it's a little slightly different

296
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,046
but similar to that whole circus
sequence in Monkey one.

297
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:58,440
You just walk into that and they can
make a move up to that top shot basically.

298
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,399
Petty: We haven't designed in
the actual characters yet for the game.

299
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:04,466
Tim is still writing and coming up with
exactly what the world is.

300
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:08,166
So we just sort of picked a character
out of one of Bagel's sketches

301
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,446
and put it into the game.

302
00:15:10,446 --> 00:15:12,846
And we needed to do, you know,
we just needed it to move around.

303
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:15,340
So I just did some really
quick animation on it.

304
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,540
It's certainly not great animation

305
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,500
but just to get it to kind of
move around the world.

306
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,300
And follow the camera.

307
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,160
And so I think, you know,
you kind of get a sense of,

308
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,820
is how the camera might follow the player
and kind of lag behind the player.

309
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,133
How it might move around the screen.

310
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:32,399
And you'll see that one of the things
we're doing here with this character

311
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,433
is that as he's in this canopy,
he's kind of tinted green and darker.

312
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:40,500
And as he emerges into the sun,
here he becomes a little brighter.

313
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,180
And we don't really have, you know,

314
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,360
any true lighting that's going to
paint it into the painting,

315
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,799
but I'm doing some simple things
where we're using like color gradients

316
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,819
based on location of the world and
kind of multiplying it in this character.

317
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,253
Just with the goal of getting to
feel part of that environment.

318
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,927
And that's a type of
trick that we could do

319
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:58,087
technically in the game image
if we wanted to.

320
00:15:58,087 --> 00:15:59,181
And it's really quick to do.

321
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:01,541
But it's enough to help him
harmonize with the environment.

322
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,033
Schafer: Please join me in welcoming
Mr. Chris Remo to the company.

323
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:19,133
[Applause]

324
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,840
Schafer: Remo's our community manager.

325
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,300
He's been here now
for two weeks or so, ish.

326
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,520
Chris, could you please stand up.

327
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,980
[Laughter]

328
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,560
Any questions about any of that stuff
before we talk about projects?

329
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,960
I'll give you the update on Double Fine
Adventures, awesome game.

330
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,680
I'm working on design stuff

331
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:42,060
and we have a team actually working on
tools and engine and visual,

332
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,626
pre-visualization of what
the art side will look like.

333
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:48,154
And I'm putting together one of
my deliverables for the milestone,

334
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,126
in a couple weeks.

335
00:16:49,126 --> 00:16:50,306
It's like a story document and stuff.

336
00:16:50,306 --> 00:16:52,100
And at that point
I'll be like probably sharing more info

337
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,500
about the game with
other people company-wide.

338
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,100
Rice: Well I mean, Tim's been doing
brainstorming stuff for a while.

339
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,607
And that's still what he's doing,

340
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:04,947
just kind of holing up in his office
and figuring out what the game is.

341
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,425
Schafer: You know, at the very beginning
I'm locked in my room a lot writing dialogue.

342
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:16,453
But then I kind of have the job of
pulling this whole thing down the road.

343
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,013
You know, so I was ready
to finally pitch to the team.

344
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,819
I'm not really, haven't really felt right
to pitch to the whole company yet.

345
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,699
That'll come later but, so
I pitched to the whole team.

346
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,380
Schafer: OK. So I'm going to talk about
the game today with everybody.

347
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,040
And some people have heard about it
and some people have not.

348
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,640
Did I talk to you about the game?

349
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,240
Some people have not, not just you.

350
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,233
[Laughter]

351
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:41,333
Petty: There're several
people in Wisconsin.

352
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,953
Schafer: As you see, I've
made a lot of progress.

353
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,480
I've designed some monster designs.
Rice: I like it.

354
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,940
Schafer: And then I was going to go
and do some detail about some ideas

355
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,440
for the beginning of
one side of the story.

356
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,500
Just 'cause the first example,
like a sample game play

357
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,200
and then we can all tear it apart

358
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,520
and talk about how it's never,
never, never going to work.

359
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,920
Schafer:
And it's an interesting process where...

360
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,680
deciding when to solicit feedback
and when to actually sell.

361
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,713
It's like sometimes you're selling
and sometimes looking for feedback.

362
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,460
And the idea... And early on
I could sense like in the meeting,

363
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,960
'cause we talked about that as being
a feedback session about the pitch and stuff.

364
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,007
I realized I didn't want any feedback
right then, like any in-depth feedback.

365
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:27,867
So I kind of pitched the game
and then kind of moved the meeting forward

366
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:30,926
and ended it
and because there is an early stage

367
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:34,454
where you don't want any feedback
because it doesn't really mean anything.

368
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,126
Because they don't know still
entirely what you're thinking

369
00:18:38,126 --> 00:18:39,487
and they might have
an image in their head

370
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,680
but it probably isn't exactly like
what I have in my head.

371
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,214
So I almost don't
want their opinion of it

372
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,653
because they're not talking about
the thing I'm talking about.

373
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,460
They're talking about their own,
how they see it.

374
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,180
Offscreen Voice: Can I contribute
as a devil's advocate?

375
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:57,446
Schafer:
I like where this is going.

376
00:18:57,446 --> 00:18:59,206
Remo: To me the strongest parts
of this by far

377
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:02,466
are the thematic aspects
of the two characters in parallel.

378
00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:04,026
Especially switching
between those, I think,

379
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:06,420
could be incredibly important
and really, really cool.

380
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,060
Both in terms of game play and aesthetics
and the stuff supporting that seems so

381
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,580
high-concept to me that it might
end up being top-heavy.

382
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:18,740
Like it seems, it just seems like
a really complicated thing.

383
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,173
Schafer: People at, you know,
at that meeting can bring up any sort of problems

384
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,500
but it's just too early, you know.

385
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,920
I dare them.
Nice try, Chris Remo.

386
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,987
What were we thinking inviting
that guy to the meeting?

387
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:39,100
Hey, maybe this thing you're
doing shouldn't be done.  Thanks.

388
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,140
Remo: That's... I mean...

389
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,760
Schafer: I guess because I see it working
in my head, it isn't that complicated.

390
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,233
I see that being like just
providing a structure, actually,

391
00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:53,466
to how everything has to behave.

392
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:55,766
Schafer: I do want is
like when I say the idea,

393
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:58,406
what other ideas that
makes that person think of.

394
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,700
Like you know what would be cool?
And how they want to add to it.

395
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,520
Petty:
I love hearing new ideas.

396
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,753
I like, Tim is a very, a lot of times Tim,
the way he describes ideas is like,

397
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,620
like the fact he described
a box cover for a game

398
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,787
that doesn't exist is
a very Tim thing to do.

399
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:14,846
Like he has, he's not an artist per se,
like visual artist,

400
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,540
but he thinks very visually.

401
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,174
And I think that's
helpful for someone like me

402
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,446
and it's probably why we work
so well together, is, you know,

403
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:23,407
he's got these ideas and
I can sort of, you know,

404
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:26,980
as he's drawing out the birthday cakes
and stuff like that

405
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,000
I probably shouldn't talk about...

406
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,740
As he's drawing out some of the ideas
on the white board in really simple fashion,

407
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,380
I'm immediately starting
to think about like,

408
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,046
well, how's that going to
put together in the space

409
00:20:35,046 --> 00:20:37,374
and how can we emphasize that
or make that work.

410
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,813
And so that's exciting to hear.

411
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,353
Schafer: Anyway. So you pick
which side you're on.

412
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,527
I've only been, I've been working
on this one a little bit.

413
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:51,020
So imagine it would just kind of
scroll the boy off the screen.

414
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,940
And she would be sitting here
leaning on this tree on a hillside.

415
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,247
My drawing gets worse and worse
the more people are watching.

416
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:05,587
Kipnis: Are those her legs?
Schafer: It could be
Lee: She's a tick.

417
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:08,907
Schafer: Yeah, turns out
she's a tick in the end.

418
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,540
Kipnis: They're both human.
Schafer: They're human, yeah,
yeah, they're human.

419
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,433
Petty: Yeah, I think the idea's
really cool and I think visually,

420
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:23,166
I think there's a lot of interesting stuff that we have,

421
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,799
I haven't really had a chance
to talk to Tim yet,

422
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,000
but I think there's a lot of
interesting stuff thematically

423
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,840
that is appealing to me.

424
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,940
I mean, there's this sort of almost
Tale of Two Cities quality to it.

425
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:37,306
I can see a lot of good ambiguity
in the way that that story is structured.

426
00:21:37,306 --> 00:21:39,300
I think that's really, will be great.

427
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,800
And to be a way that we, from a design

428
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,200
and narrative way move
the genre forward a little bit.

429
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,480
Kipnis: I want, I want something new
to be brought to the table

430
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,380
that wasn't there before.

431
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,920
And I'm not sure what that is quite yet
because I still don't have like

432
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,200
a very clear idea of what the game's
going to be like.

433
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,494
But hopefully I can contribute to that.

434
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,700
Franzke: Yeah, I know, I'm confident
from a technology point of view

435
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,760
be able to do what is necessary.

436
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:09,560
I hope it's going to be good.

437
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:18,020
[Music]

438
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,986
Schafer: All right.
Rice: Wait you forgot the big thing.

439
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:22,306
Rice: Bar crawl.

440
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,260
Schafer: Who can go to
the bar crawl tonight?

441
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,520
Petty: I can't go tonight.
I'm too sick, actually.
I have to go home and sleep.

442
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:42,780
[Music]

443
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,360
Offscreen Voice: Actually, Tim,
can you just say what we're doing again?

444
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,500
Schafer: Where... you don't know
where we're going?

445
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
Kipnis: It's for the camera.

446
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,600
But you know, should I
make sound really natural

447
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,400
like I'm just happy
to be talking about it?

448
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,300
Kipnis: Hey Tim, where are we going,
by the way? Do you know?

449
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,434
Schafer: What?
Kipnis: Where are we going?

450
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,640
Schafer: I don't know.
Where are we going? No.

451
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,906
Tonight is a very special night

452
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:08,900
because we are going to retrace
the history of Double Fine

453
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,533
through the code names of
our projects.

454
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,800
Shall we do that again?

455
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,440
Projects.

456
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,420
The history of our company as told by
the code names of our projects,

457
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,000
which are mostly taken from
Chinatown dive bars.

458
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,753
Offscreen Voice: Why don't you tell us
about what happened last night?

459
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,620
Schafer: You mean
between me and, oh, oh.

460
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,180
Last night.

461
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,313
So we went on a quest last night
to find a code name for the project.

462
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:36,706
It's fun.  I mean we used to,

463
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,434
like in the very
beginning of the company,

464
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,173
when we only like, the whole company
was like twelve people,

465
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,146
we'd go out a lot together.

466
00:23:43,146 --> 00:23:47,026
And go bar crawling together
and we hadn't done that a lot lately.

467
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,387
But it was fun to get back
out there again with the team.

468
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:53,867
Kipnis: I think you're, you're greatly
overestimating my alcohol tolerance.

469
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,420
Schafer: All I heard is you are great.

470
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,200
[Laughter]

471
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,060
Schafer:
It was like a team kickoff event.

472
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:04,860
[Music]

473
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,593
Schafer: Lipo was the very first code
name of our very first project.

474
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,967
This is the code name for Psychonauts.

475
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,220
Rice: Never heard of it.
What's that?
Schafer: Let's go.

476
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,633
Schafer: Buddha is the code name
for Brutal Legend.

477
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,507
Hi, I'm Tim. Nice to meet you.
What's your name?

478
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:21,587
Man: Peace again.
Schafer: That's a weird name.

479
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,660
Schafer: EZ5 is the code name
for Happy Action Theater.

480
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,933
Grasslands was our code name
for Psychonauts II.

481
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,140
Who knows if that'll happen.
If that happens, we call it Grasslands.

482
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,807
Bow Bow was the code name for
Brutal Legend II, we started on that.

483
00:24:39,807 --> 00:24:54,647
[Singing]

484
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,094
Schafer: There's some documents
called Bow Bow.

485
00:24:57,233 --> 00:24:58,973
Vesuvio was Once Upon a Monster.

486
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,447
Empress is short for Empress of China
