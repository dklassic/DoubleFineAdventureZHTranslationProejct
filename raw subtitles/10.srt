1
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,700
Bailey: Directed towards, yeah.

2
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,555
Well, it's complicated.

3
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,735
Like that's, that is the question, 
that was my question for me and like,

4
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,439
I mean a definite like, I'm definitely 
looking for a solution like this

5
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,558
in order to not have the game, you know,
 come out, you know, a year from now

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,890
and, because I don't know 
where that money will come from

7
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,550
and what we'll have to do to get it.

8
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:18,760
[Music]

9
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,620
Schafer: Anything else happen 
with Broken Age last week during GDC?

10
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,856
Kipnis: Nice work hosting there.

11
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,655
Schafer: Thank you, thank you.

12
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,100
Thank you, thank you.

13
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,640
Schafer: But what is beauty in a game?

14
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,211
Is it the most realistic depiction of a human?

15
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,170
Is it some sort of expressive 
stylized perspective on a reality?

16
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,092
Is it, it is polygon count?

17
00:01:41,382 --> 00:01:44,142
The answer is polygon count.

18
00:01:44,142 --> 00:01:46,162
OK. Awesome. Well, great.

19
00:01:46,162 --> 00:01:48,299
Now that that is settled let's check out

20
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,440
these nominees for the 
award for Best Visual Arts.

21
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,944
Schafer: I'm just glad that was over.

22
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,030
Petty: The Advisory Board, all,

23
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,170
even people like Chris Hecker 
said you were really good.

24
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,537
Schafer: Even Chris Hecker?

25
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,258
Kipnis: Even Chris, 
Schafer: He didn't say I was like two

26
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,740
Cliffy B's taped together or anything like that?

27
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:08,661
Chris Hecker joke. No.

28
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,761
That's a really insider thing.

29
00:02:24,065 --> 00:02:28,180
[Applause]

30
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,954
Team Member: And then Greg 
doing work with Broken Age

31
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:32,440
and all the PR stuff around GDC,

32
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,963
I think he especially liked 
seeing that trailer roll out.

33
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:37,068
It kind of gave me chills.

34
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:37,988
It was cool, Greg.

35
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:38,780
Schafer: That was awesome.

36
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,454
And in our forums it was like, 
it was funny to see how many people

37
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,977
were touched by the line 
about the 90,000 closest friends.

38
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:45,504
Like a lot of people were like, 
I was crying when I saw that.

39
00:02:45,504 --> 00:02:47,884
And I was like, oh man, 
i'm glad we tossed that in there.

40
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:52,229
I didn't think... 
Bailey: Yeah, after the trailer's released,

41
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:56,551
just watching the reaction 
of the crowd, it was pretty surreal.

42
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,429
And you know, I had the benefit 
of also, I think the viewers

43
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:04,692
had the benefit of watching the reaction 
of the team, I think was also amazing.

44
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,820
So it's right in line with, 
you know, something big.

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,316
I think it gave a lot of people 
chills and you know,

46
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,160
I think we're onto something special here.

47
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:19,061
Rice: Yeah, we had a lot of stuff last month.

48
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:21,621
That seems like it was like 
five months ago, though.

49
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,880
But yeah, it was good.

50
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,571
It was nice to be able 
to talk about it publicly,

51
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,400
get the game out there a little bit more.

52
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,540
People seem excited.

53
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,480
Schafer: Thanks for coming, everybody.

54
00:03:33,032 --> 00:03:34,779
And are there any backers 
of our project here?

55
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:37,479
Backers? [Cheering].

56
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,109
Rice: I heard nothing but positive things.

57
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:42,987
I even like tried to dig 
for bad things, like I always do,

58
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:49,429
even though I like hate looking at 
certain message forums and message boards

59
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,810
and comments in certain websites.

60
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,793
But like you do it just to 
see what people are saying

61
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:58,184
and to know all aspects of what 
people are saying about the game.

62
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,946
And the places that usually people are pretty harsh,

63
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,260
they all seemed pretty positive.

64
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:09,451
Schafer: And we're finally on the cover of Game Informer!

65
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,400
What? Batman?

66
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,980
Where is it, where is it?

67
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,928
Oh, here it is.

68
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:19,588
Delivering on a Kickstarter promise.

69
00:04:19,588 --> 00:04:21,808
That's nice. Good.

70
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,180
Here, Oliver.

71
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,010
Here's one for you. 
Franzke: Thanks.

72
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:27,718
Schafer: Takes the cake.

73
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,620
Head in the clouds.

74
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,420
Here, want one of these?

75
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,860
Kipnis: What is it?

76
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,940
Schafer: It's our article, Game Informer.

77
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,380
Schafer: See if you can find it, 
see if you can find it.

78
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,142
There's a special article 
I wrote about you in there.

79
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:45,942
Schafer: Can I drop these off?

80
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,021
Game Informer, Double Fine, 
yay, they came.

81
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,580
I heard you tearing through the script.

82
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,480
Petty: I was just, 
Schafer: One take Petty.

83
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,200
Petty: There were a few improvised 
lines about anal dildos,

84
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,272
but no, there weren't.

85
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,640
Just kidding.

86
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,709
Schafer: Thanks for pointing that out,

87
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:02,687
'cause the camera's here.

88
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,540
Petty: Hey Paul!  Whenever Paul's around
I think of anal dildos.

89
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,460
Schafer: He's kidding.

90
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,280
Those anal dildo lines 
are written in the script.

91
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,580
He's always taking credit for the best stuff.

92
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,985
Schafer: You probably heard of the company's

93
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:15,025
outrageously successful Kickstarter campaign.

94
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,320
Offscreen Voice: Hey, he's walking through the whole intro.

95
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,421
Schafer: Surprise party's waiting for her.

96
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:21,801
That's, it's called a "surprise" party.

97
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,680
I said don't give too many 
spoilers out and he goes,

98
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,500
he's like I get paid by the word.

99
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,078
Offscreen Voice: Is that what he said?

100
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,577
Schafer: No.

101
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,380
I'm like, we gotta fill this stuff with something.

102
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,959
Double Fine still has work to do
 but if Broken Age stays the course,

103
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,140
we'll all in for a treat.

104
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,400
I'd buy that.

105
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,280
I'm going to buy that game.

106
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,320
Oh, everything after that last, after 
that first announcement trailer

107
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,145
and the game forum thing was all positive,

108
00:05:51,145 --> 00:05:54,465
I think we got a lot of just 
excitement out there.

109
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,680
I stayed away from any mean 
forum comments or YouTube comments.

110
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,840
I didn't' see too many of those.

111
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,617
It was all great.

112
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,560
It was all great, 
I think for people to see it.

113
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,969
Schafer: OK. Exciting.

114
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:16,309
Now back to work.

115
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,522
And we're done with 
all that marketing stuff.

116
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:22,942
Now we're back to full-time working 
on the game content, which is exciting.

117
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:33,240
[Music]

118
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:36,477
Offscreen Voice: Are you excited to play the game?

119
00:06:36,477 --> 00:06:39,197
Schafer: I've seen sneak peeks 
from the office and I'm super-excited about

120
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,120
some beautiful stuff that I saw, 
some fancy polished things.

121
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,771
I cannot wait to play it.

122
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,860
Ryken: I mean we're getting more 
and more color every day.

123
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,333
It's so fun to go from like 
that black and white one

124
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,651
and then just like start, you know,

125
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,235
doing a few things in Photoshop 
and then you do an export and it's like, whoosh.

126
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,860
And just like it starts feeling like 
a real, real vibe to the scene.

127
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,980
Schafer: Look at that awesome ladder work.

128
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,220
Do that again.

129
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,100
It just seemed like a whole different game.

130
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,540
Schafer: Like everything was 
super polished, all the doors open, close.

131
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,628
You go in through them and sound 
effects happen and the effects were all in.

132
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:29,508
And it was amazing.

133
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:32,328
Like it really was very heartening.

134
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:35,003
Like I got, I started to get excited 
about the final product of the game.

135
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:38,559
Like I always get excited about the progress, 
but seeing that, I was like oh, man.

136
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,917
When people actually see this and 
get this as final adventure game

137
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,786
that they bought and paid, 
you know, paid money for

138
00:07:44,786 --> 00:07:46,433
and are playing, they're going to love this.

139
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,420
Which is great.

140
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,983
'Cause up until then you're just happy 
like oh, his head doesn't pop off anymore.

141
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:54,621
Oh man, the pixels are 
on the screen, this is amazing.

142
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:57,521
But there it's actually starting 
to look like a kind of fancy game.

143
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,780
It's looking all fancy.

144
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,160
Peck: Yeah. Actually the spaceship's
 coming along quite a bit.

145
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,015
Pretty impressed with it every time.

146
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,760
It's gotten really far, really 
fast so it's been really fun.

147
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,319
Franzke: This is temporary still, 
but if we go into this room,

148
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,785
it actually looks pretty cool.

149
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,645
So again, you have a sweet reflection

150
00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:20,025
on the ground and if you look 
at the door, obviously once it opens,

151
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:22,934
actually that, like that reflects properly, too.

152
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,453
And you have like areas that, 
you know, are kind of more dirty now

153
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,262
so they kind of block the reflection a bit more

154
00:08:28,262 --> 00:08:31,367
and there's like stuff that's 
completely opaque like a carpet.

155
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:33,607
And that also blocks the reflections.

156
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,860
It works pretty well so I'm 
quite happy with how that turned out.

157
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,400
And it' pretty cheap.

158
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,200
So you know, these days in games 
on a console, usually what you would do,

159
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,336
you would basically, you render the
entire image into a texture

160
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,720
and then you can just like,

161
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,320
basically use the texture to 
calculate those kind of reflection effects.

162
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,370
On mobile devices doing 
that is really, really expensive,

163
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,610
so we said we can't do it like that.

164
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,520
So we're basically investigating 
different approaches of doing that.

165
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,620
And what we are doing now here 
is actually only, is using a super-old trick

166
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,068
that very often we use during 
PlayStation One and PlayStation 2 times.

167
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,220
Where we take the geometry and we flip it
and we render the geometry again.

168
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:21,387
And it gives the impression like 
something is being reflected.

169
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:25,063
So yeah, it's all just smoke and mirrors.

170
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:26,323
Smoke and mirrors.

171
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,135
Petty: So it lets us sort of get a variety of surfaces

172
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,157
where you can sort of see like 
some of the light coming down here.

173
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,640
That's, I just painted that in.

174
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,220
It looks like the light was stretching out there.

175
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,014
It's all fake.

176
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,245
You can see our lighting system 
in action here, too, actually.

177
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:39,814
Is that, you know, he kind of 
gets into this dark area and he gets darker,

178
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,100
but I've been going through 
doing lighting on all these scenes

179
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,241
as we've been painting them, 
so he's gets a sort of orange,

180
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:47,221
subtle orange rim light 
coming in off this area.

181
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:50,341
You can sort of see it, I can zoom in here a little bit.

182
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,323
And you can kind of see this 
subtle orange stuff here on his shoulders

183
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,950
and that goes away as he 
walks away from the source.

184
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,490
You can see here it's entirely gone.

185
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,751
And just as a demonstration 
of how powerful this lighting is,

186
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,188
this is what he looks like 
in the scene with no lighting.

187
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,260
So even the smallest amount of color 
and grading helps him sit in the scene.

188
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,580
And since we have such 
a diverse set of environments,

189
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,238
people can go in, it was 
really important, you know.

190
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,160
I think lighting is one of those, 
it's always one of the best tools in any game,

191
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:27,864
to sculpt the game play and 
influence the player in a non-heavy handed way.

192
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,084
So it's actually a really 
powerful tool that I think

193
00:10:30,084 --> 00:10:32,049
a lot of people don't 
spend enough time with.

194
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:35,697
And lighting's always been 
one of my focuses, just because I, as an art director,

195
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,840
it's one of the easiest things to 
go in later and both address game play issues

196
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,485
but also just mood issues, you know,

197
00:10:41,485 --> 00:10:44,945
to kind of push and pull it, to get it 
closer to where the story's going.

198
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,600
Franzke: Lydia did all this 
sweet like teleporter effects,

199
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,398
which just look pretty sweet.

200
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,876
Like every week, I'd look at the game like all the teleporter effect again

201
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:57,919
awesome, just absolutely amazing.

202
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,372
Choy: A lot of times for ambient effects people,

203
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,120
like usually I'm the 
only person thinking about it,

204
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,200
what can, how we can 
make the scene less static.

205
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,300
So I think it usually 
surprises people, which is fun.

206
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,881
Yeah, so this one was cool 
because I asked the artists to,

207
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:19,301
like they, they often paint in lighting.

208
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,968
But I let, asked them to keep it 
on a separate layer in Photoshop

209
00:11:23,968 --> 00:11:27,610
so I could like break it out 
and animate it with effects.

210
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:33,450
Because before these were just 
like static and part of the scene layer.

211
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,400
Schmitz: This is 3D?

212
00:11:39,142 --> 00:11:43,942
Crook: Yeah, so it's like, it's like, it's kind of fake-o.

213
00:11:43,942 --> 00:11:45,542
Why, why is it not?

214
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,541
Schmitz: This is all red back here.

215
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,807
So basically like the whole UI is like these panels,

216
00:11:53,807 --> 00:11:56,147
there's like the settings.

217
00:11:56,147 --> 00:12:00,550
And you can like make levels 
and we did all these icons and stuff.

218
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:03,354
It was like a lot of design stuff.

219
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,626
It took forever.

220
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,261
Garner: Really, that's cool.

221
00:12:06,261 --> 00:12:07,829
That is a hefty line job.

222
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:09,129
Schmitz: Yeah, it was huge.

223
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,089
Rice: And Corey is kind of like a friend of a friend.

224
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,898
I've a lot of kind of mutual
friends with him and I'd seen his stuff

225
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,139
and I always liked his stuff

226
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,675
and that it's really simple and kind of retro, but new.

227
00:12:20,945 --> 00:12:23,192
And just really slick and clean.

228
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:25,214
And so it seemed like it would be a good fit

229
00:12:25,214 --> 00:12:28,428
and he'll be on the project for a month or two.

230
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:32,916
And kicking off recently we just had our first meeting with him

231
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,996
and he'll be checking in some UI stuff.

232
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,580
Schmitz: Yeah, I kind of like 
the handcrafted-ness of the game.

233
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,840
That's something that I would want to have present in the UI if it's possible,

234
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,941
it'd be cool.

235
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:47,941
Petty: Yeah, and I think that's 
probably the biggest way

236
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:50,356
to connect it with the other 
visuals without having,

237
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,582
without like just, you know, 
oh, it's painted, too, you know.

238
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,084
Rice: If it comes to the point where you have like

239
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:57,644
a really strong vision of what
you want your stuff to look like

240
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,224
and it doesn't fit as much 
with the stuff that exists.

241
00:13:00,224 --> 00:13:02,831
Schafer: Nothing is untouchable, remember that.

242
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,400
Lee's going to bring that up again, 
but it's going to mean something different.

243
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,120
Lee: That's more a Greg comment.

244
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,968
Schafer: That's more of a, I don't know.

245
00:13:10,968 --> 00:13:11,808
Rice: That's a Lee comment.

246
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:13,503
Rice: You mean Lee towards Greg.

247
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,140
Schafer: Unsolicited backrubs.
Double Fine Nights.

248
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,747
Petty: I mean I think we made good progress.

249
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,304
I don't think, I don't think you can 
be unhappy with the look that we have.

250
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:28,988
I, of course, always want to take it further.

251
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:33,157
I still think we're not pushing 
parallax and multi-planning enough,

252
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,721
you know, but I think that 
we have everything we need for that.

253
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:38,516
It's really just a matter of getting in further

254
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,240
and find the right place to do those.

255
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,945
And then there's a lot, I think 
once we get real voice acting

256
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:47,945
and see final animation, some of the 
great effects work Lydia's been doing

257
00:13:47,945 --> 00:13:50,266
You see all those things together, 
hopefully they'll,

258
00:13:50,266 --> 00:13:51,746
goes to where it needs to be.

259
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,298
Schafer: OK. Are we going to get, 
are we going to get fog on his helmet?

260
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,603
Is that a thing?

261
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:58,463
Rice: Get what?

262
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,056
Schafer: When he's breathing, hah!

263
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,283
Did we talk about that last time?

264
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:05,426
I thought we talked about that, 
like getting steam on the inside of his helmet?

265
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,040
Yeah, that'd be cool.

266
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,859
And there's something missing 
with the irises, missing on his feet, is that?

267
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,320
Yeah. 
Offscreen Voice: Yeah.

268
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,840
Schafer: After this I guess they're 
working on the intro to the girl's world.

269
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,672
The girl's called Vella, by the way, yeah.

270
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,060
Short for Veluria.

271
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,058
They have names, yeah.

272
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,220
Vella and Shay.

273
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,993
The girl's named Vella; it's short for Veluria.

274
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,480
Her sister's named Rocky, 
which is short for Raquel.

275
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,345
I wrote all the dialogue 
for the intro to her world

276
00:14:36,345 --> 00:14:38,545
and named all her parents, stuff like that.

277
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,813
Ryken: That's going to be fun.

278
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:45,834
It's funny because it's like you work 
on the Cloud Colony for so long

279
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:47,648
and you're like, clouds, clouds everywhere!

280
00:14:47,648 --> 00:14:50,408
And it's fun at first, and then 
you're just like, I'm sick of clouds.

281
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,040
And then like, you're like, yay!

282
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,485
And like it's like we're in space.

283
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:58,586
And like we're in like enclosed like, 
like hard surfaced everything.

284
00:14:58,586 --> 00:14:59,608
This is super-fun.

285
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,428
And then you're like, oh man, 
we've been in space for a long time.

286
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,013
And then like, yeah, you kind of like 
do look forward to,

287
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,911
'cause you live in these little like, I mean,

288
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,144
I'm sitting at a computer screen

289
00:15:09,144 --> 00:15:12,533
but you're really like in 
these little enclosed areas,

290
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,975
you know, while you're working on them.

291
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,245
And you spend a lot of time with them,

292
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:20,365
so just the idea of getting outside 
again is like kind of fun, you know.

293
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,020
Schafer: So here's the Vella enter dialogue.

294
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,584
Lately, because I, previously did not know
 how to use the new dialogue database.

295
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:28,844
And it's always, I never had time to learn,

296
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,520
I've just been like, OK, 
put all this dialogue in.

297
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,305
So I wrote the Vella enter dialogue.

298
00:15:33,305 --> 00:15:35,031
Like these are all just cut scenes or chatter.

299
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,900
So this is just like her mom talking, 
or if a stage direction in that column.

300
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,833
I put dialogue here and the name of the character.

301
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,340
And then this column on the left 
is only, only has stuff in it,

302
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,548
interactive dialogues where she, so 
here is the dialogue with the grandpa.

303
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:55,218
I tag each dialogue choice, like with 
one dash ten for being in node one, line 10.

304
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,400
And then I say whether that 
line is on or off when you start the dialogue.

305
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,765
And then at the end of it, 
it's automatically assumed

306
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:05,940
that line's going to go away 
unless I say, "always on".

307
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,830
And then there's all those logic 
for turning on and off other dialogue choices.

308
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,596
So the dialogue choices, this is 
almost like a little macro,

309
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,835
like a little mockup 
programming language in a way,

310
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,536
'cause the programmers can 
take this and turn it into logic, too.

311
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,731
Make the dialogue choices work.

312
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,860
And also, when I'm writing 
I had to play music.

313
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,095
It usually doesn't have lyrics 
unless it's really old heavy metal

314
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,300
or Led Zeppelin that I played a million times.

315
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,040
I can always go into 
my Black Sabbath folder.

316
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,560
[Rock Music]

317
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,060
It's good.

318
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,065
So I wrote some lines.

319
00:17:01,065 --> 00:17:02,794
Including the line "Really, SPLARG?

320
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,256
Is it my birthday or something?"

321
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,240
That's going to be, probably 
the best line in the game.

322
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,760
Can't tell now but ten years 
from now you'll know.

323
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,220
[Guitar Solo]

324
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,840
Schafer: So much for that design.

325
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,299
Rice: Part of this was that I wanted 
to talk about all the potential meetings

326
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,099
that we are supposed to think about.

327
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,875
Schafer: A meeting about 
meetings that we gotta to have.

328
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,400
Rice: I have a list here of like 
these are all the meetings

329
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,961
that Tim is supposed to have early this week.

330
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,818
Let's figure out if we can do that.

331
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,719
Schafer: How 'bout none of them?

332
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,140
Rice: And that's, that's kind of 
what I was going to say.

333
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,140
Is that, 
Schafer: I don't want to have any meetings.

334
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,440
Rice: I know. I don't either.

335
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,472
Schafer: I'm supposed to be writing every morning,

336
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,880
dialogue and then designing 
with John afternoons. 
Rice: Yeah.

337
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,813
Schafer: Look, it's John Swisshelm.

338
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,724
John, what are you doing here at dailies?

339
00:17:48,724 --> 00:17:50,324
John is here for a week.

340
00:17:50,324 --> 00:17:53,564
Swisshelm: I'm going to help Tim out 
this week and maybe longer after this.

341
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:57,184
I'm excited to just look at, I've been 
looking at all the docs,

342
00:17:57,184 --> 00:17:58,960
through all the docs, catching up.

343
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,742
Maybe I can be a good set of fresh eyes

344
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:02,602
on some of the stuff you 
guys have been head down on.

345
00:18:02,602 --> 00:18:04,662
This is interesting for me, 
too, because I was backer

346
00:18:04,662 --> 00:18:08,874
before I joined Double Fine, so 
it's awesome to be working on this project.

347
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,400
Schafer: Thank you for backing, 
thank you for your backing.

348
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,788
Paul's going to check that right now, 
can you give me a verification on that?

349
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,910
Don't bring up how much he paid, though.

350
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,694
Swisshelm: Let's just say I got t-shirt and a poster.

351
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,984
Schafer: Yo, very nice, very nice.

352
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,921
Swisshelm: I don't know 
where the poster is anymore.

353
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,584
Schafer: Well, I always, I always 
need someone to bounce ideas off of

354
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:29,582
and talk to, you know.

355
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:34,551
So sometimes if, sometimes 
I take the whole team,

356
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,924
brainstorm with them or 
just take a few people on the team.

357
00:18:36,924 --> 00:18:40,064
But everyone's working so hard now that,

358
00:18:40,064 --> 00:18:41,591
'cause sometimes just sitting 
in your office by yourself,

359
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,080
even with a notebook it's really hard to

360
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,703
kind of get through the thoughts and ideas.

361
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:48,921
And we were talking through, so when everyone contributes and talking with John,

362
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:50,101
we had a bunch of ideas.

363
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:54,401
So it's just, it's just more productive 
to brainstorm with someone else.

364
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,320
Schafer: Well, welcome to 
the project, Mr. Swisshelm.

365
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,253
Just to prove how natural 
and I don't notice the cameras at all,

366
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,540
let's shake hands like this.

367
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,720
Natural.

368
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,174
Swisshelm: Nice wave we got going on here.

369
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,048
Schafer: Yeah.

370
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:16,059
Schafer: Great to have you.

371
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,680
Swisshelm: Good to be here.

372
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,821
Schafer: You like my bar fight joke?

373
00:19:19,821 --> 00:19:21,503
I was giving my joke, the solution 
to every design question.

374
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:22,849
It'd be like, you should have a bar fight.

375
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:24,307
That worked in Uncharted II.

376
00:19:24,307 --> 00:19:25,767
Did I mention, no, Uncharted III.

377
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:26,790
Swisshelm: Three, the beginning.

378
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,450
Swisshelm: I wasn't on two.

379
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,994
What else have you designed 
besides the bar fight in Uncharted III?

380
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,720
Swisshelm: I did a lot of stuff, 
just here and there.

381
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,112
Schafer: At EA, what did you do, Dead Space?

382
00:19:36,723 --> 00:19:37,743
Swisshelm: I was on Dante's Inferno.

383
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:38,900
Schafer: Dante's Inferno.

384
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,700
Swisshelm: And some other games 
that will never come out.

385
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,428
Schafer: Was it your idea to 
have babies that you kill?

386
00:19:42,428 --> 00:19:44,908
Swisshelm: It was not my idea.

387
00:19:44,908 --> 00:19:48,134
Most of that was not anybody, 
well, it just one of those ideas,

388
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,096
we had to just deal with it, 
make it as cool as we could.

389
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,050
Schafer: So blame on it Dante.

390
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,696
Swisshelm: Exactly.

391
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,186
Schafer: OK. So the girl's world.

392
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:56,896
I've got to come up with a name for this world.

393
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,991
The Seedlins or something, is where all the, OK.

394
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,366
This is the world with the girl in it 
and this is the world with the boy in it.

395
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:03,381
And these are the locations.

396
00:20:03,381 --> 00:20:05,301
There's Sugar Bunting, her home town.

397
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:07,481
Meriloft, the Cloud Colony.

398
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,140
Shellmound is there's some concept art 
in the back of a town made of sand castles.

399
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,136
This is the Dead Eye God's pyramid.

400
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,200
This is the forest, from there.

401
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,500
Swisshelm: Games are complicated, man.

402
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,309
Like they're so complicated.

403
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:23,349
That's the one thing that this always, 
this drives me crazy.

404
00:20:23,349 --> 00:20:26,254
Even the most simple game, 
when you really break it down

405
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,717
has many different elements 
that need to work together.

406
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,790
And so, you know, Tim thinking 
about things on a high level

407
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,762
and then also thinking about 
or actually writing dialogue,

408
00:20:36,762 --> 00:20:39,951
I think that's, that's a lot of, a lot of stuff to do,

409
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,231
a lot of stuff to keep in your mind.

410
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,341
So I think having, having, 
I think I was able to go in and help kind of

411
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:47,896
be an external brain for him for a little while.

412
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,080
Just to think about 
some of the high level things

413
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,800
that he hasn't had time to process in a while.

414
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,180
So he could really focus on that 
dialogue that the team needs to use to,

415
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,317
you know, get this section 
of the game up and running.

416
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,660
Schafer: So those are the kind of 
open design questions I'm working through.

417
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,760
It's basically finish out 
the puzzle path for the girl.

418
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,739
Swisshelm: Designers have a big responsibility

419
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,680
because other people's work depends on them.

420
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,299
What gets in the game and 
you know, what they do, what,

421
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,205
if you make an assumption 
and then it ends up not working

422
00:21:16,205 --> 00:21:17,693
and you have to throw away a bunch of stuff,

423
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,320
now you've just cost somebody, 
something that they've,

424
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,729
they've put their heart and soul into;

425
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:23,018
it might not be included in the game.

426
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,680
And that's, and that's a reality, 
but it's also heartbreaking.

427
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,240
So I think it's a big pressure for game designers

428
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,552
to make sure that they're 
using their tools to the best of ability

429
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,024
to suss out some of those 
problems and work them out before it gets

430
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:42,304
to the point where somebody 
is modeling or painting or animating.

431
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,700
Schafer: OK. Let's do the bucket puzzle.

432
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,900
How do you get the bucket from the hermit?

433
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,920
Swisshelm: It'd be nice if that worked
 together with the boars somehow.

434
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,455
Like maybe it's a feed bucket.

435
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,429
Schafer: It's a slop bucket.

436
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:55,389
Swisshelm: Yeah. And then you...
Schafer: What?

437
00:21:55,389 --> 00:21:56,369
Offscreen Voice: Milk.

438
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,088
Schafer: Oh, he's milking the boars?

439
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,140
You like the boar milking?

440
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,884
But he sells boars' milk.

441
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,961
Later we'll have a puzzle that you use boars' milk.

442
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,640
So how do you steal this poor guy's bucket?

443
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,301
Swisshelm: He could be using it in other ways.

444
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:15,613
He's catching a drip with it.

445
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,840
Schafer: It's his toilet.

446
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,500
It's his latrine.

447
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,260
You have to get him really constipated

448
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,440
so he doesn't need to use his latrine anymore.

449
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,375
Swisshelm: Luckily, boars' milk stops you up.

450
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,026
Schafer: Oh, yeah.

451
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,060
Schafer: I mean, when we're thinking about,

452
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,757
I guess I have a certain way 
of thinking about puzzles

453
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,130
and certain elements that I 
always want them to have, like a certain,

454
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,245
I try to have the, like the narrative of the story

455
00:22:44,245 --> 00:22:46,916
be something that would be 
actually fun to tell to someone else.

456
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,773
Like oh, I went here, I did this thing.

457
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,051
Like have the actual actions 
not sound really tedious, like.

458
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,221
And I put this moustache 
on a cat and you know.

459
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,500
But have them sound like really fun, 
like I punched this sea monster in the mouth.

460
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,072
Schafer: Holy crap that's so productive.

461
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,331
Oh, Paul didn't see, 'cause he was texting.

462
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,980
That's fine.

463
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,320
We totally did three puzzles today essentially.

464
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,659
Awesome.

465
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,720
Swisshelm: Sweet.

466
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,373
Schafer: Our rule in the old days, always two puzzles a day.

467
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,280
Swisshelm: OK.

468
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,300
Schafer: So three puzzles we're
pretty much taking the day off tomorrow.

469
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,580
Swisshelm: We only have to do one tomorrow, yeah. That's great.

470
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,660
Schafer: No, he had, he brainstormed with me

471
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:24,540
and we talked about the puzzles 
for the remaining part of the game.

472
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,700
He had some good ideas 
and now I've got to wrap that up,

473
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,225
but it's kind of undetermined right now,

474
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:33,463
'cause I need to know 
the scope that I'm designing to.

475
00:23:33,463 --> 00:23:35,412
And that's what Matt Hanson 
is coming up with now.

476
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,580
He's coming up with 
what he calls the currency.

477
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,704
So OK, you've got three cut scenes here.

478
00:23:39,704 --> 00:23:42,838
You can spend them here or 
you can spend them over here.

479
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,480
So I kind of need to know those 
constraints to, so I can wrap up the design.

480
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,173
Hanson: We're kind of breaking 
the game down by scenes,

481
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,639
so we're able to put a value, 
a cost value to each one of those scenes.

482
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,460
And it gives us a better estimation 
of how long it's going to take

483
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,200
to actually builds those things.

484
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,800
And it's just going beyond 
what we had originally anticipated.

485
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,160
And that that was something that, we 
just were able to get to that realization

486
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,800
by getting more insight into the design.

487
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,861
Petty: I don't know 
that the scope of the game

488
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:17,901
is really growing as much 
as our understanding of it.

489
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:18,773
It's a big game.

490
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,180
I mean, it's not a, it's not a small game

491
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,427
just in terms of the scope of 
environments, characters, puzzles.

492
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,700
You know, it's not always a correlation 
to like play-through time,

493
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,040
you know, like that's very variable,
especially in adventure games.

494
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,780
But just in terms of the scope 
of the game, it's a pretty big game.

495
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,995
Schafer: I think one of our problems, though,

496
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,720
or maybe one of my problems 
is just the ambition of the game.

497
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,980
Like I always have a very ambitious games.

498
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,079
And when we're doing like a $400,000 game,

499
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,160
probably hadn't triggered that feeling yet in me.

500
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,660
I was thinking small.

501
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,400
But as soon as it got big, 
I was like OK, we're doing it.

502
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,220
We're doing a big game.

503
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,185
Schafer: The current schedule has us 
going out until other millenniums,

504
00:24:59,185 --> 00:25:03,646
which is going to be hard on us 
financially so we are... 
Petty: Generational game?

505
00:25:03,646 --> 00:25:04,966
Schafer: Yeah. It's something that I,

506
00:25:04,966 --> 00:25:06,306
I mean our kids' kids will finish it,

507
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:09,474
but just knowing that they will 
have a thing of beauty to worship

508
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,482
in forever will be worthwhile.

509
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,920
Hansen: The game is going to cost 
more than we originally anticipated.

510
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,409
Is that something that we 
can recoup at some other time

511
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:22,249
on the project or from other projects or whatever,

512
00:25:22,805 --> 00:25:25,785
it's, it's something I'm, luckily I don't have to deal with.

513
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,880
Bailey: There's actually very 
few avenues available to us.

514
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,029
We could take on outside investment,

515
00:25:34,274 --> 00:25:36,773
but when you look at as 
far as the schedule goes

516
00:25:36,773 --> 00:25:41,813
and how big the story is, like how 
we get material funds to finish this.

517
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:49,960
And you know, it just gets to 
a point where potentially it's insurmountable.

518
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,533
So, but that's why, you know, 
we have clever people all working together,

519
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,514
all thinking about this and 
figuring out how we can make this happen.

520
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,610
So you know, I could go and 
it'd be like, hey, we need another million.

521
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,693
I can get a million without 
strings attached, got a million.

522
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,597
Schafer: Let's see how Brutal Legends sold.

523
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,840
It said $916,593, dollars.

524
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:17,759
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, dollars.

525
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,510
That's awesome.

526
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,390
[Applause]

527
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,533
Bailey: Got a million.

528
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,874
OK, we need another million.

529
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,680
OK, I got another million for you.

530
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,282
Schafer: We are launching the 
Humble Double Fine Bundle today.

531
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:32,582
And if it makes a ton of money, maybe 
we won't have to cut anything from the game.

532
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,120
It's just like the Kickstarter all over again.

533
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,285
Bailey: It's just nice.

534
00:26:39,285 --> 00:26:40,805
Like I watch money going out every day.

535
00:26:40,805 --> 00:26:42,505
I love these events when we have;

536
00:26:42,505 --> 00:26:45,105
we actually have a chance to 
see some money coming in.

537
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,980
Schafer: I really am not going to get 
my hopes up any higher than like $200,000.

538
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,960
I think Justin is hoping for like a million dollars.

539
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,060
Bailey: OK, I got another million for you.

540
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,980
OK, we need six million.

541
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,500
Schafer: We've had a too much game

542
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,077
to make in too little time problem the whole time.

543
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,840
And there's just been periods 
we've been able to forget about it.

544
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,380
Like, I'm really happy about the trailer.

545
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,486
Let's just forget about the fact that

546
00:27:10,486 --> 00:27:12,544
we don't know how we're going to get 
the rest of the game done on time.

547
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,853
But it's still there.

548
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,721
And I think now this is the 
most direct, head-on attack

549
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:19,021
we've been making 
towards fixing the problem.

550
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,610
You know, the scheduling stuff 
that Matt's doing is really quantifying it

551
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:27,028
to the point where we can attack it 
instead of just talking about attacking it.

552
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,688
'Cause I've been thinking about it like

553
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,428
when I'm designing like how to simplify stuff,

554
00:27:30,428 --> 00:27:37,425
but it's obviously a much bigger, 
much more drastic actions.

555
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,079
Schafer: Why don't you mention your crazy idea?

556
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,620
Bailey: OK. A crazy idea.

557
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,336
So we have, it's like, it's, 
so you're a writer, obviously.

558
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,949
And when you sit down to 
write a story and you basically,

559
00:27:49,949 --> 00:27:52,655
you look at it, you think 
maybe you have like a book.

560
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,415
And then you maybe realize you have a novel.

561
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,927
And then looking back, 
Schafer: What's the difference 
between a book and novel?

562
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:58,920
Bailey: Well, I think there'd be more pages.

563
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,599
So, and then you have like, you have a
 maybe, maybe you even have a series.

564
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,198
Like maybe that's the whole story to tell.

565
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,189
And the thought is, is that we 
potentially have scope-wise enough content

566
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,209
for a game to ship sooner rather than later.

567
00:28:15,255 --> 00:28:18,875
So we're talking about acts and 
the stuff is actually broken up into acts

568
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,711
and then maybe the Act One 
provides a great cliff-hanger

569
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,923
for potentially another installment, 
which would be Act Two and the conclusion.

570
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:30,539
But that, that was the idea.

571
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,762
I mean, I guess some reaction might be,

572
00:28:32,762 --> 00:28:36,958
oh, but you leave the story in a place 
where there's a lot of doubt,

573
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,020
but it's, you know, it's almost like 
The Empire Strikes Back, right?

574
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,184
Where you end it and you have 
all that anticipation building up.

575
00:28:43,184 --> 00:28:45,088
It also gives us a chance for, you know,

576
00:28:45,088 --> 00:28:47,463
if the game is going to 
cost six million right now,

577
00:28:47,463 --> 00:28:51,355
if it costs three million, 
you know, that's basically,

578
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,510
we've spent all the money 
that's come in for us by the backers.

579
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:58,178
So we've delivered on the mandate 
that we spent all the money

580
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,676
to make a game of a very high quality.

581
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,710
And then the second game, you know, 
from the sales of the first game,

582
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,424
we can then fund the second game.

583
00:29:05,424 --> 00:29:07,073
Which I think is actually pretty elegant, so.

584
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,781
And it gives us a chance to reuse art,

585
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:10,961
reuse the engine that we've 
already developed, you know,

586
00:29:10,961 --> 00:29:14,781
it seems, seems like a pretty good solution.

587
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:19,220
Stamos: I like the idea 
of delivering something.

588
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,851
Schafer: I mean, the assumption did 
come up once during Grim Fandango,

589
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,300
because Grim was late.

590
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,420
And people were like, 
it does, and then more than this,

591
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,840
that story's split into four years really easily.

592
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,974
Like let's do it in four episodes.

593
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,660
But if we had done that based on 
the perception of the sales of that game,

594
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,339
there never would have been 
the rest of Grim Fandango.

595
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,120
We never would have made it 
because the first one,

596
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,333
Stamos: But it was a boxed product, too, right?

597
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,859
Schafer: Yeah. But we would have made the first one

598
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,425
and they would have been like, 
well, that wasn't a huge hit.

599
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:47,145
And so they would have just cut it.

600
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:56,560
And that's why I'm torn about it, 
'cause I'm kind of glad we didn't do it then,

601
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,152
'cause it did get, it did get made.

602
00:29:58,152 --> 00:30:01,042
And you know, it made its numbers internally there.

603
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,160
Rice: Wanted me to just, we all know how
 big the amount of hype is for this game,

604
00:30:06,163 --> 00:30:09,463
more so than anything that 
we've worked on since I've been here.

605
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:13,860
And it seems like it'd be 
unfortunate to squander that.

606
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,051
Bailey: In a weird, 
Schafer: Who's squandering it, though?

607
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,340
Which part?

608
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,706
Rice: It just seems like since 
there's so much excitement

609
00:30:20,706 --> 00:30:22,486
and so much hype built up around it,

610
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,012
that means that there's going to be 
a lot of excitement when it comes out.

611
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,840
And so we should try to deliver the 
best project that we can to capitalize on it.

612
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,046
Bailey: But see, that's the interesting 
part, what you're talking about.

613
00:30:34,046 --> 00:30:36,936
Is because our main worry is 
that this gets cut short

614
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,700
and we have to wrap it up quickly, right?

615
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,311
And I think by not actually releasing
 something early and commercializing it,

616
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:45,549
that actually becomes more of a risk than if we do.

617
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:51,864
Schafer: It's definitely in Justin's mind 
this is what's happening.

618
00:30:51,864 --> 00:30:53,660
Definitely in Greg's mind it's not happening.

619
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,708
And I'm really in the middle.

620
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:56,919
Like I, I'm willing to do it

621
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,917
because I know it's something we 
might not have any option not to do

622
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:02,197
and really to make, try and turn it 
into a positive thing.

623
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,240
But I also know there's going to be 
some problems associated with it.

624
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,815
And actually if we could trim back the
 schedule enough an stretch the money

625
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,784
enough to where they meet 
and we can actually do it,

626
00:31:12,784 --> 00:31:15,404
I'd probably save it and 
just release it all at once.

627
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,820
Petty: In some ways it's letting us 
make it the length that it wants to be.

628
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,358
By releasing something that is 
a compelling stop point,

629
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,500
it's just not a complete product, 
but it's a compelling stop point.

630
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,959
And I think if we, my feeling is 
that if we told the backers that like,

631
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,896
'cause they keep saying how 
do we get to more money?

632
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,085
You know, if you look at the forums, 
they're like these are hardcore guys.

633
00:31:33,085 --> 00:31:36,545
This is saying like releasing it, 
clearly saying its the first act,

634
00:31:36,545 --> 00:31:38,722
you guys get it for, I don't know, 
a week or whatever.

635
00:31:38,722 --> 00:31:41,069
Then we're going to start some online sales.

636
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:42,844
People will buy the product, they're not backers

637
00:31:42,844 --> 00:31:44,855
but they're going to get 
to actually purchase the product

638
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,478
because we need that money to make 
the game that we want to, that you deserve.

639
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,786
Which is true.

640
00:31:49,786 --> 00:31:51,792
It's not smoke up their ass.

641
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:54,489
But I think it's just a funding model 
to be able to do that.

642
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,975
Schafer: 'Cause like this is like 
in some ways a sneak peek.

643
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,260
This is just like you're 
getting this half of it early.

644
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,140
Bailey: Yeah, we could make it, 
it's actually not the release, right?

645
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,046
This is not the release.

646
00:32:04,046 --> 00:32:06,526
This is just, this is for, 
Petty: It's a pre-release.

647
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,089
Rice: I think it's a good solution potentially

648
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:12,069
to a way to get more 
money for this project,

649
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,880
but it isn't as good 
for the game necessarily.

650
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,140
It's just a good way to fund 
the rest of the development.

651
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,703
Bailey: You know, with Greg, 
this project is his baby.

652
00:32:24,703 --> 00:32:25,667
It's Tim's baby, too.

653
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:29,527
So like, I kind of defer to Tim 
on what he wants to do with it.

654
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:35,136
But it is sometimes hard to step 
outside that and take the riskier course

655
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,702
when it's something you've been 
working so passionately towards.

656
00:32:37,702 --> 00:32:39,402
Rice: And that's kind of what 
we're trying to figure out now.

657
00:32:39,402 --> 00:32:41,300
And I think that it's also,

658
00:32:41,621 --> 00:32:45,373
I have a unique perspective being 
that I'm the studio's brand manager

659
00:32:45,373 --> 00:32:50,401
and so I also have to like responsible 
for everything outward facing

660
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:51,681
that comes out of the studio

661
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:55,741
and what people, what people's 
perception is of what we're doing.

662
00:32:56,547 --> 00:32:59,887
I feel like we've been in this 
cycle for four years of

663
00:32:59,887 --> 00:33:02,191
jumping from contract to 
contract and game to game

664
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,980
and we need to take a bet on a 
game that has the best chance of anything

665
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,355
that we've worked on, of making us 
money and getting us out of that cycle.

666
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,360
Schafer: We could still do all that.

667
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,180
We could still put that money in, 
Rice: But I think it just cheapens the product.

668
00:33:16,185 --> 00:33:18,794
It just feels like I'm 
not getting a full game.

669
00:33:18,794 --> 00:33:21,696
I'm getting a game that 
wasn't the original vision.

670
00:33:21,696 --> 00:33:23,191
Schafer: But you are getting it.

671
00:33:23,191 --> 00:33:25,651
You're just getting a look at it sooner.

672
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,140
You're getting a look at the first half sooner.

673
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,343
Bailey: I think we're kind of 
stuck on the traditional route.

674
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:32,210
It's like it's, this is forging new territory.

675
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,210
I mean, I love this.

676
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,810
Rice: I don't think there's anything 
we've done that's traditional here.

677
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,390
Bailey: Exactly. So why start now?

678
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,300
Schafer: I got the solution here, right there.

679
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,940
This is the solution to all our problems.

680
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:50,880
Yes.

681
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,820
I cashed outed all the backer money;

682
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,860
I'm leaving. Whoo.

683
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,180
Tomorrow I'm going to 
go pick up the Barracuda;

684
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,180
it's finally done.

685
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,800
And the mechanic is like, 
it needs to be cash.

686
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,469
You just don't ask questions.

687
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,179
It needs to be cash.

688
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,279
Just bring the cash.

689
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:22,339
But it's also twice what we 
originally talked about it costing.

690
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:30,040
Mechanic: The thing with yours is 
that it was hard to know where to stop,

691
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,560
when you cut it open.

692
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,280
Where do you draw your lines?

693
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:36,359
Like, you know, the heater/air 
conditioner should have really come out

694
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,500
while I was under there.

695
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,420
And that should have been fixed.

696
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,840
And then that means the 
air conditioning compressor

697
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,520
should be fixed and 
plumbed and recompressed.

698
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,460
And the steering column.

699
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,620
I took it out and I'd like to have 
changed the turn signal switch,

700
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,100
but it was working.

701
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,179
So I just put the column 
back in, you know.

702
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:56,119
I didn't, I cleaned it and 
everything but I didn't take it apart.

703
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,320
So there are places you 
got to draw your lines

704
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,140
where you stop on a project like yours.

705
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,440
Schafer: It's hard to know where to stop.

706
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,100
Schafer: So it's like, I mean, 
I went and looked at all the work.

707
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:12,000
It's not like he's like, he just did 
a lot of stuff that needed to be done.

708
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,800
There's a new electrical 
harness on it and new starter.

709
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,440
But he also like fixed all 
these switches and stuff.

710
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:25,070
It's going to be much better and 
so it's really going to be a pleasure to drive.

711
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,950
It just cost twice as much as I thought.

712
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,140
Pretty much just like Broken Age.

713
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,155
Schafer: It was a journey 
that I went through, in a way.

714
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,012
Mentally, of like hating the idea

715
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,460
and actually feeling this 
is the way to save the game.

716
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,680
Schafer: I'm going to talk about the thing.

717
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,703
There's a thing going on which we've been talking about.

718
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,183
Would you like to hear about the thing?

719
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,547
It's about an idea.

720
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,099
A scheduling idea for this game, 
because we have, as you know,

721
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:14,839
kind of a schedule problem, which 
is that I designed a game

722
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,042
that's too big for the schedule 
that we have and the money that we got.

723
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,740
The other idea that was put forth recently

724
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:24,040
was what about releasing 
Part One of the game early.

725
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,835
And at first I was like, 
oh, that sounds terrible,

726
00:36:27,835 --> 00:36:30,535
because like the first half of the game 
ends in such a cliff-hanger and all this.

727
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,640
But as an alternative to 
cutting the game content in half,

728
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:38,047
and I do like that idea a lot better.

729
00:36:38,205 --> 00:36:40,145
Offscreen Voice: You think you 
might like piss people off?

730
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:43,600
Schafer: Depending on how we do it, 
it could definitely piss people off.

731
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:49,440
But yeah, if you're giving them 
a choice of hey, you guys,

732
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:52,792
we could either cut the design in half

733
00:36:52,792 --> 00:36:56,632
or we could just go out and try 
to find some money magically

734
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,488
and then ship the game next year 
or you could get the first half now.

735
00:37:00,702 --> 00:37:02,581
And I think people, I don't know 
what they would say.

736
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:05,902
Like I would think people would 
want to, want to play what they could play.

737
00:37:05,902 --> 00:37:08,742
As long as it was done, finished 
and good and not rushed out the door,

738
00:37:08,742 --> 00:37:11,362
I think they would like to 
play what they could play.

739
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,440
Rice: I'm feeling more comfortable about it,

740
00:37:13,955 --> 00:37:18,643
so I mean, it's just a matter of 
you want the perfect game

741
00:37:18,643 --> 00:37:25,163
and we, you know, you're working
so hard with a really distinct vision in mind.

742
00:37:25,163 --> 00:37:28,683
And so now we're at the point 
where it's like, OK, realities have set in.

743
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,100
We got to ship this game at some point.

744
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,560
Ultimately like we're just doing what's best for the game.

745
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,840
We want the game to succeed.

746
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,860
We want it to be good.

747
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,659
We want people to be excited about it,

748
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:42,879
but we also want to be 
sensitive to the needs of the studio.

749
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,660
And I think that there's a way 
that we can do all of those things.

750
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,220
We ran into the same thing 
with Iron Brigade.

751
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,220
I remember we had a meeting 
where like our Microsoft producer flew down.

752
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,260
We sat in this room for three days 
and it was like, we might cancel your game

753
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,501
unless you can prove 
to us that you can finish it in,

754
00:37:57,501 --> 00:37:59,321
you know, however 
many months and make it good.

755
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,729
And we had to like figure out 
how to change everything, all the structure,

756
00:38:02,729 --> 00:38:05,729
cut things and make really smart 
decisions on how to actually get it done.

757
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,080
And it was an awful meeting 
and everybody hated each other,

758
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,184
but we came out of it 
with a really solid plan

759
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,610
and we knew what we were going to do.

760
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:16,270
And I think this is just that stage 
where it's like the huge hump to get over,

761
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,050
but at the end of this we're 
going to have like a clear plan

762
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,770
for the rest of production.

763
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,410
Everyone's going to know what 
needs to happen and we're going to just,

764
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,790
you know, plow through it.

765
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:33,660
[Music]

766
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,360
Schafer: It feels like the right thing to do.

767
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,900
But at least we have an actual,

768
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,256
real schedule now that is not 
based on just our hopes and dreams

769
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,380
but actually has math that shows 
that we'll be done in a certain month.

770
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,980
January for Part One and 
April for Part Two.

771
00:38:47,680 --> 00:39:23,520
[Music]

772
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,188
Schafer: Well, nothing really.

773
00:39:25,188 --> 00:39:29,368
I mean I feel like, I feel like we 
want to show what making games

774
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:32,018
is really like and this is what 
making games is really like.

775
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,746
Like tough choices, tradeoffs,
 compromises, arguments, you know.

776
00:39:37,746 --> 00:39:40,666
And then in the end it all 
turns out to be something great.

777
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,440
Hopefully.

778
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,780
Offscreen Voice: Part one of something great.

779
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,760
Schafer: Part one of something great.

780
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,700
Yeah.
