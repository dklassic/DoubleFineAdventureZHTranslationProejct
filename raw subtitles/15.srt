00:00:25,347 --> 00:00:27,281
Cameraman: How are we going to 
continue making this documentary

2
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:29,341
without spoiling anything?

3
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:31,249
Schafer: I don't know.

4
00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:34,749
People know now if they've, hopefully 
they're not watching this episode

5
00:00:34,749 --> 00:00:36,089
before they finish Act One.

6
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:39,143
You really shouldn't watch this episode.

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,379
Should we you shoot that now?

8
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:43,248
Hi. I'm Tim Schafer.

9
00:00:43,248 --> 00:00:46,808
Please don't watch this episode until 
you finish Act One of Broken Age.

10
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:51,668
Offscreen Voice: Backers that play it,

11
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:53,663
or are you more nervous 
about the money,

12
00:00:53,663 --> 00:00:55,380
like how much it's going to sell?

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,900
Schafer: No. I mean, I feel 
like it's tense about the money

14
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,323
because we want it to do well, 
because I have big plans for Act Two.

15
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:04,280
And if we don't do well, 
Justin will be like,

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,457
look, look, we can't, 
we got to, you know.

17
00:01:07,457 --> 00:01:11,916
Because basically, just spending our 
own money from here on out.

18
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,499
And probably like a few months back.

19
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:17,012
So if no one buys the game tomorrow,

20
00:01:17,012 --> 00:01:20,212
maybe Act Two will be a 
much smaller than Act One.

21
00:01:22,322 --> 00:01:25,409
I hope one person buys it.

22
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,800
If no one buys it, it's 
going to be really awkward.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,847
But I guess that's a good clear, 
I can say that to the backers.

24
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:33,282
Look, nobody bought it, 
except for you guys.

25
00:01:33,282 --> 00:01:34,722
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,941
But it serves me right for 
investing our own money in a game.

27
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:40,801
I should have just 
played with their money.

28
00:01:42,664 --> 00:02:08,446
[Music]

29
00:02:08,446 --> 00:02:10,928
Schafer: We are 
launching Red's tomorrow.

30
00:02:10,928 --> 00:02:14,182
Crazy times.

31
00:02:14,182 --> 00:02:16,802
All of our backers.

32
00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:21,044
Thank you to our team 
for working so hard.

33
00:02:21,044 --> 00:02:26,039
We are going to the backers tomorrow 
and the rest of the general population,

34
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,000
future backers, if you will on the 28th.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,751
Rice: The game is up.

36
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,002
Preorders are up.

37
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:35,156
Schafer: Whoohoo! Rice: Yeah.

38
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,873
Schafer: All right, next game.

39
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:38,773
Rice: I will send the press release.

40
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:49,699
One of the reviewers 
said he didn't go to bed.

41
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:51,047
Finished the game last night.

42
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:52,040
Remo: Finished it last night?

43
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,309
Rice: Yeah. Remo: Wow.

44
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:55,628
Rice: Yeah, I sent the codes at like...

45
00:02:55,628 --> 00:02:57,237
Remo: Did he say how long it took him?

46
00:02:57,237 --> 00:02:58,613
Rice: 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. Remo: Oh, right.

47
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:00,222
Rice: So I mean, I guess there's time.

48
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,469
But yeah, he just didn't stop.

49
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:03,309
That's kind of awesome.

50
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:05,947
Schafer: Man, this is weird.

51
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:07,187
People are playing Broken Age.

52
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,910
Seven people watching 
him and I'm one of them.

53
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:17,465
I don't want them to 
know this is what I do.

54
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:18,469
I've never done this before.

55
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:21,672
We've never been able to do 
this before and have live streams,

56
00:03:21,672 --> 00:03:23,692
like after Grim Fandango.

57
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:30,159
Remo: People are already 
posting screenshots.

58
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,314
Bailey: I'm still waiting.

59
00:03:31,314 --> 00:03:34,470
I'm just curious who's going to 
be the first one to like post a review.

60
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,682
Remo: Yeah, right.

61
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,349
Rice: Tim, did you hear that? 
Schafer: What?

62
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:44,191
Rice: Digital Trends posted an article, 
"Why We're Breaking the Broken Age Embargo."

63
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,864
And how they're going to review it.

64
00:03:46,864 --> 00:03:49,142
Schafer: Well, what 
embargo are they breaking?

65
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:49,933
Rice: The review embargo.

66
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:52,123
They're going to put a review up.

67
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:53,525
Schafer: They're just announcing 
they're going to break it?

68
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,761
Rice: Yeah. 
Schafer: Why?

69
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:58,666
Rice: Because they paid for 
the game and they're a backer.

70
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:02,784
And they're getting it 
because they paid for it.

71
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:06,267
Schafer: But we, but they're not, 
they're in the Beta...

72
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:08,488
Rice: They haven't reviewed it yet, 
but Digital Trends, I know.

73
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:10,748
They emailed me about this yesterday 
and that's what I told them.

74
00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:12,292
Remo: Technically no one signed anything

75
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:14,453
so there's nothing we can actually 
do about it now. Rice: Yeah.

76
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:16,046
Schafer: What do you think about that? 
Bailey: I'm sorry?

77
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:17,637
Rice: Yeah, I don't think there's 
anything we can about it.

78
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:18,743
Bailey: Well, unless we 
have something in writing.

79
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:21,375
Remo: No, we don't. Embargoes 
are not really enforceable.

80
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,451
Bailey: Exactly. 
It's a professional...

81
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:24,738
Remo: I know, I know. It's a courtesy.

82
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:26,324
A professional courtesy, yeah.

83
00:04:26,324 --> 00:04:29,565
Schafer: Well, maybe he didn't agree to 
anything but he knows he's being a shit.

84
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:32,373
Schafer: It's like people don't 
realize that everything's embargo.

85
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,535
Like every review they read 
has usually been embargoed,

86
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:38,223
because your game's coming out and 
people want the press for the game

87
00:04:38,223 --> 00:04:41,706
to come up on launch day or 
around that time people can buy it.

88
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:45,049
'Cause if it comes out before, then 
all that energy, people see that article,

89
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:45,944
they can't go buy it.

90
00:04:45,944 --> 00:04:46,837
So anyway.

91
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:49,351
You want your, you want to 
time your press to that day,

92
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:52,697
but different reporters can 
come in at different times

93
00:04:52,697 --> 00:04:55,519
and they're like hey, 
I want to, you know,

94
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,213
just because this guy 
came in a week early,

95
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,515
does that mean his review 
gets to go up a week earlier?

96
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:01,308
So you say it's embargoed, 
so that all the press

97
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:05,252
has a fair chance of getting their story, 
not getting scooped or whatever.

98
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:08,807
And they also have time 
with the build to do a thoughtful build

99
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:10,191
instead of racing to 
like getting it out early.

100
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:14,196
But we were going out to backers 
and 90,000 people had the build

101
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:15,874
and I think most of the 
regular backers were like,

102
00:05:15,874 --> 00:05:17,330
OK, yeah, this is private information.

103
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,963
I won't spoil it for people 
who can't buy it yet.

104
00:05:19,963 --> 00:05:21,990
And the press understood it.

105
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,207
But there's kind of this grey area 
of people between backers and press,

106
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:28,983
like a, kind of like a blogger, 
you know, who's a backer,

107
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:30,964
who's like, hey, I paid money for this.

108
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:33,198
This guy's amazed to see 
consumers suggest the press

109
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:36,677
should stick their heads in the sand 
because Double Fine asked them to nicely.

110
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:39,999
For the evening crowd, the 
Broken Age embargo's a bit of a joke.

111
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:44,495
Has anyone else contacted you 
from actual news outlet? Rice: IGN.

112
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:46,553
Schafer: Do they want to review 
it or just, what'd they say?

113
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:47,647
Rice: Yeah, it was just yesterday.

114
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,981
It's like I just want to be 
clear on what's expected.

115
00:05:49,981 --> 00:05:51,371
He says like I feel like 
there's so many people

116
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:53,856
that are going to be having the game.

117
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:55,744
Like if other people start 
running their reviews,

118
00:05:55,744 --> 00:05:58,535
we're going to feel like we're 
going to have to run ours.

119
00:05:58,535 --> 00:06:00,075
That's basically what they said.

120
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,070
Schafer: Why don't we 
just let the people

121
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,804
who are not being jerks 
about it break the embargo?

122
00:06:07,804 --> 00:06:08,829
Rice: We can't do that.

123
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:12,127
Schafer: And that would scoop all the 
people who are being jerks about it.

124
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:14,763
Why, we can't do that?

125
00:06:14,763 --> 00:06:17,674
Rice: I don't know how to enforce that.

126
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:18,931
Schafer: Just pick the ones 
that are being nice about it

127
00:06:18,931 --> 00:06:21,544
and just tell them they can.

128
00:06:21,544 --> 00:06:24,986
Then one day later tell everyone else.

129
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:27,682
Rice: Yeah. I think that only 
serves to inflate the issue,

130
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:31,815
because then they think 
the embargo is still there

131
00:06:31,815 --> 00:06:34,906
and then it's being broken 
and then it's a mess.

132
00:06:34,906 --> 00:06:37,972
So I think we have to, 
Schafer: It's kind of a mess, though, I think now.

133
00:06:37,972 --> 00:06:42,272
Rice: Well, then, that's the case and 
I think we have to talk about lifting it.

134
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:47,560
And then I'm fine like, 
I've been saving the list of people

135
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,523
I've emailed all the review stuff

136
00:06:49,523 --> 00:06:54,163
so it would really be like a two second 
Kickstarter update and emailing them all,

137
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,443
if you want to just totally lift things.

138
00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:02,635
Schafer: Maybe we could just 
open it in a couple days, kind of.

139
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:04,052
Rice: Just sit on it 
for a second and see.

140
00:07:04,052 --> 00:07:06,161
Schafer: Yeah. Rice: OK.

141
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:08,528
Schafer: God, that embargo's a disaster.

142
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,847
Schafer: And so because like one or two 
people were threatening to like break it,

143
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:15,534
that all of a sudden made everybody 
else who wasn't breaking it like a chump.

144
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:18,725
And I didn't want them, you know, 
to feel, so we just like, look, OK.

145
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:21,147
We take back our request 
that no one's, go ahead.

146
00:07:21,147 --> 00:07:22,716
Post all the reviews and stuff.

147
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:26,153
So a bunch of our reviews went up 
when people couldn't buy the game.

148
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:28,457
So that was kind, 
it took away a lot of our,

149
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:31,208
like our press hit for the 
launch day, which is too bad.

150
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:34,760
But it seemed like it was, it would, 
we just couldn't, it was out of control.

151
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,181
There was just like 90,000 people,

152
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:41,862
even if like 80,000 of them 
are totally like, yeah, it's cool.

153
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,377
But if like just a few 
took one or two breaks,

154
00:07:43,377 --> 00:07:44,637
then the whole thing just falls apart.

155
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:47,505
Schafer: All our backers are so cool,

156
00:07:47,505 --> 00:07:50,998
but the backers who are in 
the press feel a little differently.

157
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:52,878
They feel they have 
the option to not be cool.

158
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,393
It's an awkward situation.

159
00:07:56,393 --> 00:08:00,653
Next time we wouldn't, I think actually 
have private forums for that reason.

160
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:03,433
Schafer: I mean, I feel in 
end that I just don't,

161
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:07,713
I just don't want to have this fight 
any more about private stuff and all.

162
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:09,995
It just puts, I mean,

163
00:08:09,995 --> 00:08:14,228
being in this antagonist relationship 
with the press is just not comfortable,

164
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:18,740
'cause you need them and they're 
usually really good friends of ours.

165
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,084
I'm just getting mad at them one by one

166
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:24,944
for breaking the faith 
of the backer agreement.

167
00:08:25,926 --> 00:08:27,707
It's annoying.

168
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:30,328
Bailey: You know, one third 
of our, of all the articles

169
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:33,110
that were written about Broken 
Age were about the embargo.

170
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,856
And then another third were about us

171
00:08:34,856 --> 00:08:38,077
going from early access 
changing it to a regular release.

172
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:43,697
And then one third were 
about the game. Yeah. So.

173
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:47,272
Rice: If we're saying backer Beta's 
the 14th and public release is the 28th,

174
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:50,926
that would give the press builds 
like the 12th or something.

175
00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:54,892
And embargo them, 
Bailey: This is an interesting one,

176
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:57,932
because I think this is the next one 
that could lead to a PR blowup.

177
00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:01,852
Bailey: Yeah. I was not 
in favor of the embargo.

178
00:09:01,852 --> 00:09:03,824
Rice: But preorders 
are there like you said.

179
00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:06,944
So people can still at least 
go and get the preorder.

180
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:13,188
Bailey: So the preorders are, 
they're less than we expected.

181
00:09:13,188 --> 00:09:17,431
They are, we were hoping 
that they'd come in higher.

182
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:22,071
If I had to project off the 
preorders we received so far,

183
00:09:22,071 --> 00:09:27,959
that would be a kind of bleak outlook 
as far as how many we'd actually sell,

184
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,040
you know, for the 
lifetime of Broken Age.

185
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,607
But I'm basing everything off if 
different historicals for other games

186
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:39,328
that Tim has sold and none of those 
have had this kind of Kickstarter story.

187
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,748
So this is definitely unique.

188
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,978
I don't think it's time 
for us to panic right now,

189
00:09:43,978 --> 00:09:49,445
but it puts a whole lot more emphasis 
and importance on January 28th

190
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:50,887
when it comes out for real.

191
00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:55,007
'Cause I think it will do well in the long-run, 
but it's like how long is that run.

192
00:09:57,102 --> 00:09:59,714
The other piece that I think 
is kind of silver-lining

193
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:04,209
in all this is the reviews 
are coming in really good.

194
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:09,677
You know, I foresee that the game's 
going to have a great word-of-mouth buzz.

195
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:11,531
Most of Tim's games actually do.

196
00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:14,510
And they have a, 
it has a very long tail.

197
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,859
There're games, what 
people call "evergreen games",

198
00:10:16,859 --> 00:10:20,900
they keep on selling at a certain, 
certain level and they just keep on,

199
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,586
which keeps on accumulating over the years, 
which is different than most games.

200
00:10:25,586 --> 00:10:28,825
Most games have that huge spike, 
that hump, that six-weeks hump.

201
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:30,875
Tim's are different.

202
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:34,324
So that's one good thing to take 
into account with all the good reviews

203
00:10:34,324 --> 00:10:38,067
and all the social media and the 
good word of mouth we're having.

204
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:39,489
You know, it's like we 
can't get to a place

205
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:41,183
where we could sell 
this game quick enough,

206
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:44,768
because that's where we're really going 
to be able to see and project, you know,

207
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:47,472
what the success of 
the game's going to be.

208
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:49,661
Rice: So the other thing 
Tim was talking about is just that

209
00:10:49,661 --> 00:10:51,808
now that we have to move the 
embargo up and reviews are out now,

210
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:56,916
the idea of flipping the 
switch on Steam earlier.

211
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,672
Schafer: Releasing it a, a week earlier.

212
00:10:58,672 --> 00:10:59,770
Like next Tuesday.

213
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:03,283
Schafer: Sure, whatever.

214
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:07,007
and like, you know, 
Schafer: Well, that's the question.

215
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:09,407
I mean, and there's, I mean 
there's a legitimate business reason,

216
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:10,728
I think about it just 
because it's out there,

217
00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:12,115
it's getting a lot 
of attention right now

218
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:14,503
and there's a lot of press 
I'm going to do in the next week.

219
00:11:14,503 --> 00:11:20,977
And it'd be nice if people, I mean can 
go pre-purchase it, but they can't buy it.

220
00:11:20,977 --> 00:11:25,270
Rice: It'd be nice to have a story 
about the game being pushed forward.

221
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,980
Franzke: I voiced my 
concern about this plan.

222
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,451
I mean technically it does 
make like, like just looking at how

223
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:34,957
the long the things take, just 
doesn't really make all that much sense.

224
00:11:34,957 --> 00:11:36,643
Franzke: And you know, 
I explained like that.

225
00:11:36,643 --> 00:11:39,827
That we can certainly do it 
but it will be very unadvisable,

226
00:11:39,827 --> 00:11:43,198
especially considering that time 
when that was first proposed.

227
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:44,701
We still had big problems with crashes

228
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:46,757
and people not being able 
to play the game at all.

229
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:49,522
So that was my main 
worry, that you know,

230
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:54,311
we were still like trying to find 
the really big issues and so.

231
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:57,477
So we didn't feel like it 
was ready to ship it then.

232
00:11:57,477 --> 00:12:02,083
But I think now, basically I don't 
think anything will have changed

233
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,773
if we final release it on the 
planned day we had initially,

234
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:06,764
just because technically time-wise

235
00:12:06,764 --> 00:12:09,384
it doesn't really work out 
any other way, anyways.

236
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,388
Schafer: But it's good.

237
00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:16,160
So now the official reviews, 
now they are rolling in.

238
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,024
The great thing is that 
they're all really great.

239
00:12:18,024 --> 00:12:21,484
I mean, that Polygon one was 
nine out of ten, which is great.

240
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:25,407
I mean, I would give it a ten, 
but I'll accept a nine.

241
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:28,109
Polygon Review: Broken Age 
may be unfinished,

242
00:12:28,109 --> 00:12:31,422
but it's also delightful, 
beautiful, utterly charming

243
00:12:31,422 --> 00:12:35,690
and you really should 
play it right this second.

244
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,537
Stapley: No, it's cool.

245
00:12:36,537 --> 00:12:40,587
It's awesome that it sounded like, 
that we all made an awesome thing now.

246
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:42,526
Like this is the cool part, you know.

247
00:12:42,526 --> 00:12:43,639
Like we made this awesome thing

248
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:48,226
and now it's out in the 
world for everybody to look at.

249
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:52,510
Rice: Yeah, I guess. 
Stapley: OK. How many reviews are there now.

250
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,416
Crook: But it feels good.

251
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:57,166
And people seem to be 
really responding to the game.

252
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,591
The reviews have been really good.

253
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:05,778
And even comments about animation, 
which you don't get that often.

254
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:08,810
It seems like in games a lot of times, 
maybe you will a couple of times.

255
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,110
But there's been several other reviews 
that have mentioned the animation,

256
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,903
that they really, 
that they really liked it.

257
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:17,146
And that's, that's rewarding.

258
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:18,741
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

259
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:20,358
I saw a nine today; that's nice.

260
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:23,161
But you know, I actually, 
I feel kind of bad I don't really,

261
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:27,272
I try not to read a lot of the reviews

262
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:30,565
because the bad ones do 
kind of make me, put me down.

263
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:32,173
You know, they kind of, you know,

264
00:13:32,173 --> 00:13:34,271
when you're kind of on this 
high that you've released it

265
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,783
and then suddenly, even though if 
there's like six good reviews

266
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:40,717
and one bad one, that 
bad one kind of affects me.

267
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:46,405
So I try not to read a lot of 
the comments until a little bit later on.

268
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:48,939
Heatseeker Review: Broken Age gets by 
on the strength of its storytelling.

269
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:51,035
The puzzles aren't particularly complex

270
00:13:51,035 --> 00:13:56,603
or compelling with the exception 
of a certain vomiting tree.

271
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:59,997
And serve as a reason to 
explore the environments.

272
00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:01,737
I can't say I recommend this to people

273
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:05,243
who don't already have 
a fondness for this genre.

274
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:09,729
Compared to modern entries in the 
genre like those from Telltale Games,

275
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:13,066
it may seem a little 
simple or even boring.

276
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:16,704
Schafer: This is actually just 
new posts, for new posts today.

277
00:14:16,704 --> 00:14:18,925
Oh God. The guy wants a refund.

278
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:22,162
It's like, ah. This is a jerk.

279
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,004
I'm just going to say it.

280
00:14:23,004 --> 00:14:24,270
This is a jerk.

281
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,514
Thanks for backing, jerk.

282
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:28,458
Franzke: You know, it's 
unrealistic to expect that people

283
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:32,427
will be able to please 
everybody, obviously.

284
00:14:32,427 --> 00:14:35,877
Unfortunately very often the people 
who are the most dissatisfied

285
00:14:35,877 --> 00:14:39,120
are also the loudest ones, 
you know, which can be difficult,

286
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,603
especially if you're pouring a 
lot of effort and a lot of work

287
00:14:41,603 --> 00:14:44,394
and a lot of your like, 
like "soul's" the wrong word,

288
00:14:44,394 --> 00:14:47,604
but like a lot of your personal 
kind of effort into the game.

289
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:51,099
Like to see somebody come in 
and like just completely smash it.

290
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,416
I did the mistake and I should know 
better after so many years in games.

291
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:59,367
I think I went in Kotaku where they 
had an article about the "Retro Mode".

292
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:02,348
And like one of the comments, and you 
should never do that if you work in games.

293
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:03,331
Never read the comments.

294
00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:05,580
Actually, generally don't 
read any internet comments.

295
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,749
I scroll down and somebody 
was like, this just look shit.

296
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:11,381
Like this is, you know, 
here, here's a comparison

297
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:14,594
to a hand painted, 
hand painted sprites, versus down-res

298
00:15:14,594 --> 00:15:15,547
It's like, yes, obviously.

299
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:19,967
And then backers immediately jumped in
"Well they just put it in as a little add on"

300
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,135
Still the person was not 
satisfied with that at all.

301
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,090
And then he's like, well, if you 
were a backer you would see that,

302
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,999
you know, they just put in during 
the weekend as a little side project.

303
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,356
I'm not a backer but this is shit.

304
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:30,496
I'm not going to buy this.

305
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,105
It gets, [throws hands up, exasperated].

306
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,400
Having said all that, overall 
I think people are very happy.

307
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,711
I've got a lot of Tweets from people 
who are super happy with the project.

308
00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:40,673
On the forums people 
are very happy, you know.

309
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:44,327
We saw someplace where some people 
like really, really enjoying the game.

310
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:47,819
And like, you know, it's good 
to see super-positive reactions

311
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:50,950
of somebody just like laughing 
about all the jokes in the game.

312
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,290
And just generally like finding the 
game very beautiful and stuff like that.

313
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,110
So it's good.

314
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,240
Web Streamer: Fuck yeah!

315
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
Web Streamer: I don't know!  Which one!
What do I pick!

316
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,160
Oohh.

317
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,300
Shay: This must be where Marek sleeps.

318
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,685
Web Streamer: So he keeps 
the costume on while he sleeps.

319
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:15,457
That's funny.

320
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,360
Man, this is a genius 
game, genius story.

321
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:25,777
Schafer: I'm super happy that no one

322
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,194
seems to have guessed 
the big spoiler at the end of it.

323
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:29,814
I really thought that 
was going to get out.

324
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,120
And actually long ago on 
the forums, one guy guessed it.

325
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:36,397
And no one followed up on it.

326
00:16:36,397 --> 00:16:40,006
Like no one, he just said his 
little thing, hey, what if this is the case?

327
00:16:40,006 --> 00:16:41,584
And no one answered him.

328
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,178
I was like, oh man.

329
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:45,109
I feel, oh God.

330
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:49,759
You know, I hate that guy for guessing it, 
but I'm really, it's worth something.

331
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,459
We should send him some chocolate.

332
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:56,630
But everyone else has just had the exact 
like experience that I was hoping for,

333
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,107
which is that they were 
really like, oh my God!

334
00:16:58,107 --> 00:16:59,487
I didn't see that coming, that's crazy.

335
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,537
Web Streamer: It's Shay!

336
00:17:02,677 --> 00:17:04,777
Shay was controlling Mog Chothra.

337
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,970
Web Streamer: Uhhh, Shay?

338
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:15,625
Web Streamer: What the heck?

339
00:17:19,058 --> 00:17:19,898
What the heck?

340
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,868
That's Shay!

341
00:17:25,848 --> 00:17:28,512
Schafer: But they all seemed 
to really be enjoying the ending.

342
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:30,580
And so I'm really happy with that.

343
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:36,288
And I'm really happy with people's 
response to like the story, the characters.

344
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:41,285
And a lot of people, I think, will 
actually appreciate the difficulty level

345
00:17:41,285 --> 00:17:46,884
in the game once we get out of 
the most hardcore part of the audience.

346
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:51,029
I think they'll like that, 
that it flows more as opposed to

347
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:55,302
hitting a series of really, 
really hard stops, for most people.

348
00:17:59,275 --> 00:18:01,332
Schafer: I mean, you can tell 
they already anticipated that.

349
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:04,051
After play-testing the first part, 
I was like, I think this is a little easy,

350
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:09,893
but I think rather than just throwing 
a monkey wrench, Monkey Island joke,

351
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:15,533
in there, I'm really focusing on Act
Two and making Act Two a little more,

352
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:20,357
instead of things being one step, 
having them be a little more complex.

353
00:18:21,411 --> 00:18:23,631
So I'm way ahead of them, 
way ahead of them on that.

354
00:18:25,274 --> 00:18:27,363
Petty: You know, I think, 
yeah, it's interesting.

355
00:18:27,363 --> 00:18:28,874
Like the, I don't, 
I don't think I read anything

356
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:33,320
that I felt was unfair and it 
all seemed pretty balanced.

357
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,555
There were, I think, you know,

358
00:18:36,555 --> 00:18:39,653
there's some comments about 
length, maybe a couple of them.

359
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:42,011
And that's kind of difficult, 
because you know, I mean,

360
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:43,787
this was the same on Stacking.

361
00:18:43,787 --> 00:18:48,254
You know, you can, you can burn 
through an adventure game and,

362
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:50,492
and that can really shorten
your play experience.

363
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:54,503
But I don't know if that's the best 
way to evaluate that particular game.

364
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:58,263
You know, it's not a game that has a 
mechanic that just like is endlessly playable.

365
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:01,323
So it's a little, I don't know, 
you know, it's just, it's just something

366
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:04,363
that happens with adventure games 
that, I've seen that come up.

367
00:19:04,363 --> 00:19:06,112
I don't necessarily disagree with it,

368
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:09,602
but I guess I don't know what 
to say about it, you know.

369
00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:12,727
But I think, you know, in some other stuff 
is stuff that we discussed early on

370
00:19:12,727 --> 00:19:15,905
that I've seen like, you know, 
the lack of a verb coin or a verb page.

371
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,091
And I think that's just a choice Tim,

372
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,529
and I think the correct choice 
Tim made early on, you know.

373
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:23,750
I don't think there's probably people 
played Machinarium that also was like,

374
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,152
this would be better if I could have 
a look and examine and verb link.

375
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:29,440
But I don't really feel like 
the experience needed it

376
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,292
in any way and I don't really feel 
like Broken Age needs it in anyway.

377
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:33,619
And I don't really feel like 
that's where we puzzle depth,

378
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:35,574
mechanical depth anyways.

379
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:39,695
So you know, I mean, I wouldn't 
oppose it if someone really, really, like

380
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:42,485
we had started the game and we really, 
really wanted to take that approach.

381
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:47,271
But I just like the idea of you 
know, I think Tim's initial vision

382
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,919
for the game would be like, well, 
what if adventure games just kept going?

383
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,512
And we just were keeping it working.

384
00:19:51,512 --> 00:19:53,587
We wouldn't keep making 
the exact same thing.

385
00:19:53,587 --> 00:19:56,338
We'd try and mess with the 
formula and advance things

386
00:19:56,338 --> 00:19:57,883
and I think that's what 
we tried to do with visuals.

387
00:19:57,883 --> 00:19:59,987
We didn't want to 
make retro visuals, right.

388
00:19:59,987 --> 00:20:02,993
We wanted to make visuals 
that were 2D and charming,

389
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:07,227
but also took advantage of modern 
methodologies and technologies and resolutions.

390
00:20:07,227 --> 00:20:11,067
And I think the approach to the 
game play is consistent with that.

391
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:13,613
And this is a choice.

392
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:17,265
You know, and some people will 
want that exact Monkey Island moment

393
00:20:17,265 --> 00:20:21,294
and some people are like, thank God, 
the puzzles aren't that confusing, you know.

394
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:23,709
It's hard, it's hard to get the right.

395
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:27,989
Petty: So what I would like to do is 
next week, since Bagel's out for two weeks

396
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:31,877
and I wanted him to come out at 
this time so we could kick off Act Two.

397
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:35,646
So I would like to kind of, at the 
very least, we'll see who has time.

398
00:20:35,646 --> 00:20:37,522
At the very least Bagel 
and Levi and myself

399
00:20:37,522 --> 00:20:41,650
to start concept jamming next 
week on early Act Two stuff.

400
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,971
And Tim hasn't delivered the 
final design or dialogue yet,

401
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:46,701
but I already know 
some of high level stuff

402
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:49,306
and then hopefully we 
can get him to kind of,

403
00:20:49,306 --> 00:20:51,660
I can kind of like mention all that 
and he can kind of correct me

404
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,528
where he's changed things 
and just get us going.

405
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:55,775
So there's definitely a new, 
at least one new area

406
00:20:55,775 --> 00:20:59,948
that has no presence at all in 
the current act that we have to design.

407
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:01,863
And we had some very 
early stuff on it from before,

408
00:21:01,863 --> 00:21:04,638
but we haven't thought 
about it in 18 months.

409
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,042
So we'll probably start there.

410
00:21:07,042 --> 00:21:08,150
Stapley: So are these the only new,

411
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,946
this is like pretty much all we have 
to worry, really worry about, right?

412
00:21:10,946 --> 00:21:12,860
I mean, those only new things?

413
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,742
Petty: Well, this is the new 
stuff we know about for sure.

414
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:17,582
So I thought we'd start there. OK.

415
00:21:17,582 --> 00:21:20,820
So the thing that Tim, like 
he's going to be here after lunch,

416
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,912
we can him some more questions

417
00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:27,374
but the thing that we know for sure 
is that we need a monster lands area.

418
00:21:27,374 --> 00:21:30,425
It's probably also a good 
chance for us to think about

419
00:21:30,425 --> 00:21:33,096
where we want to go with, 
you know, as we're developing him,

420
00:21:33,096 --> 00:21:35,472
if we want to go anyplace 
different with Marek.

421
00:21:35,472 --> 00:21:37,065
Here's another concept 
that we can think about.

422
00:21:37,065 --> 00:21:40,497
Is we talked about, OK, 
what Alex's is.

423
00:21:40,497 --> 00:21:42,731
And originally Tim kept 
saying, well, it's, oh,

424
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:44,516
this'll be a copy of 
Mog Chothra to save time.

425
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:46,606
And I was saying, well, that's not 
really going to save us much time.

426
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:50,662
I mean, it'll save a week or 
so of production time, but...

427
00:21:50,662 --> 00:21:52,362
Stapley: It's got to 
be like older version.

428
00:21:52,362 --> 00:21:53,426
Petty: Right. Like it's been buried.

429
00:21:53,426 --> 00:21:55,233
It's not going to look the same.

430
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:57,180
I'd love to see it like 
a previous generation.

431
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,997
Because when we 
were starting to draw like,

432
00:21:58,997 --> 00:22:00,916
I don't know, maybe, like some 
of these older ones or whatever,

433
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,243
like remember we 
had all those ideas like,

434
00:22:02,243 --> 00:22:05,187
oh, it's got diamond-shape 
eyes instead of hex eyes.

435
00:22:05,187 --> 00:22:08,361
Ryken: Yeah, just 
like changes with times.

436
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:12,360
400 years, like, oh yeah, but then 
he came around to hexes again.

437
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,121
And then it went away 
for another 100 years.

438
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:15,504
Petty: We added two 
sides to our windows.

439
00:22:15,504 --> 00:22:16,707
Stapley: That's awesome. 
That's always the best.

440
00:22:16,707 --> 00:22:18,492
Like in Star Wars, 
you're like, well, that's R2D2,

441
00:22:18,492 --> 00:22:21,650
but it's a fucking red 
R2D2 and it's like different.

442
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,836
Awesome. I always love that.

443
00:22:23,836 --> 00:22:26,173
Petty: Well plus it would be cool, 
too, like this one doesn't have,

444
00:22:26,173 --> 00:22:27,773
it's been buried for however long

445
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:30,779
so it doesn't have to look 
as purely organic, you know.

446
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:34,011
Like we're not, we're no longer trying 
to make people believe it's just a monster.

447
00:22:34,011 --> 00:22:38,479
So being able to see some combination 
of the mechanical and the monster...

448
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:42,474
Ryken: Yeah, like the outer hull is just 
like ripped away and most of the parts.

449
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:45,859
Stapley: But it'll still be the same 
like rig kind of set up, right?

450
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:48,155
Petty: I mean, it could 
be whatever we want.

451
00:22:48,155 --> 00:22:49,790
Bog Chothra.

452
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,121
Stapley: Bog Chothra?

453
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,147
Bog, I like that one.

454
00:22:53,147 --> 00:22:54,464
I like Bog.

455
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,883
Ryken: Just Bob.

456
00:22:55,883 --> 00:22:58,938
Stapley: Bob Chothra? Awesome.

457
00:22:58,938 --> 00:23:00,338
That would be fucking sweet.

458
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:05,559
Stapley: All right. Should we 
call Scott and get pumped?

459
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:12,593
Stapley: Yeah! Look, whoo!

460
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:14,244
Hey, bro, get us pumped up!

461
00:23:14,244 --> 00:23:16,881
Get us pumped up!

462
00:23:16,881 --> 00:23:19,600
We're all like, boo, drawing is stupid.

463
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,827
He still in bed?

464
00:23:20,827 --> 00:23:22,276
Campbell: Chilling on the couch.

465
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:25,053
Stapley: Oh, man.

466
00:23:25,053 --> 00:23:28,052
Campbell: I was just, I was 
just watching Triplets of Belleville.

467
00:23:28,052 --> 00:23:30,055
Stapley: Oh, sweet, dude.

468
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:31,386
Campbell: What are you guys, 
what are you guys doing?

469
00:23:31,386 --> 00:23:32,479
Stapley: We're doing an art jam, dude.

470
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:34,840
We're doing an art jam and 
nobody's pumped up and like,

471
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,321
like nobody fucking 
is as psyched as you.

472
00:23:37,321 --> 00:23:38,981
You got to get us psyched.

473
00:23:38,981 --> 00:23:43,226
You know, when you and Peter are 
here, you guys are like, ooh, ooh, ooh!

474
00:23:43,226 --> 00:23:45,040
So come on, bro, do it, go for it.

475
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,141
Ryken: We need some art cheerleading.

476
00:23:46,141 --> 00:23:47,320
Campbell: Get psyched, man.

477
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,810
What are you guys 
working on? Tell me about it.

478
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,348
Stapley: All right, check it out. 
Rice: What are you doing?

479
00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:52,916
Stapley: Monster lands. 
Uh oh, look who it is.

480
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:57,000
What, tall man. 
Petty: Scott!

481
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,471
Stapley: Yeah, we're all 
getting pumped. OK, cool.

482
00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:04,702
This is one monster, man.

483
00:24:04,702 --> 00:24:06,605
Schafer: Who are you talking to?

484
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:08,489
Hi! Scott Campbell!

485
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,068
Hi! Everybody's at the art jam.

486
00:24:10,068 --> 00:24:11,322
Stapley: I'm excited to hear 
about what we're going to do,

487
00:24:11,322 --> 00:24:15,447
because, 'cause I know 
that we all like, this is like,

488
00:24:15,447 --> 00:24:19,602
not really trial and error but 
I got pretty much trial and error.

489
00:24:19,602 --> 00:24:22,144
You get closer to the end, everything 
started working really smoothly.

490
00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:26,172
So you know, it's going to be 
way better for sure, you know,

491
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:28,614
'cause we learned so much.

492
00:24:28,614 --> 00:24:31,111
But I'm, I'm actually excited to see

493
00:24:31,111 --> 00:24:34,111
how we take all the things 
that we learned, trial and error-wise

494
00:24:34,111 --> 00:24:38,838
and try to get it, you know,
see what happens with the next,

495
00:24:38,838 --> 00:24:40,878
how organized we are, what we learned.

496
00:24:41,476 --> 00:24:43,764
Schafer: OK.

497
00:24:43,764 --> 00:24:44,990
Stapley: Those 
are the new things.

498
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,690
Schafer: Monster lands and the gate

499
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,720
Stapley: And there's only the 
pollution inside like the kingdom.

500
00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:52,485
Schafer: Don't film his armpits.

501
00:24:52,485 --> 00:24:54,625
Stapley: Oh God, are they like, oh God!

502
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,265
Fuck. It's horrible.

503
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:00,772
Hey, bro.

504
00:25:02,145 --> 00:25:04,385
Schafer: Aren't you glad 
you're not here right now?

505
00:25:04,385 --> 00:25:08,038
It would be nice to get the main 
characters some different outfits,

506
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,020
just to make the game feel...
Petty: So would she put on a space suit?

507
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,304
Schafer: I see her with the radiation 
suit and I don't know necessarily if he,

508
00:25:15,867 --> 00:25:18,146
I can't think of, I haven't 
thought of a puzzle.

509
00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:18,746
What?

510
00:25:18,746 --> 00:25:19,986
Stapley: He could be in a cake dress.

511
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,711
Petty: We should do a transgender thing 
where he starts dressing like a girl,

512
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,862
'cause he gets the maiden,

513
00:25:23,862 --> 00:25:26,898
leftover maiden's outfits 
and she dresses like a boy.

514
00:25:27,198 --> 00:25:29,732
Schafer: I mean, he could put 
a druid cloak or he could,

515
00:25:29,732 --> 00:25:33,012
but he could put on 
a preener outfit.

516
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,680
remember we have those artworks,

517
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,180
you had him masquerade 
as a preener for a while.

518
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,588
He could possibly have to do that.

519
00:25:38,588 --> 00:25:39,834
I just think it would be 
more fun for the player

520
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,288
to have them look really different.

521
00:25:41,436 --> 00:25:43,264
Petty: He needs like a 
traveling cloak or something.

522
00:25:43,264 --> 00:25:45,577
Piece it together. Yeah.

523
00:25:46,320 --> 00:26:06,880
[Music]

524
00:26:06,888 --> 00:26:08,115
Franzke: Other than 
doing some concept artwork,

525
00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:10,919
nobody has to get started working 
on the second act anyways,

526
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:14,553
so a lot of us are still working 
on bug fixes for this release.

527
00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:18,366
And it's, you know, it's incremental 
update to the backer release.

528
00:26:18,366 --> 00:26:23,674
So you know, I'm really optimistic that 
this is all like minor fixes to be put in.

529
00:26:23,674 --> 00:26:27,435
But we're pretty solid, solid release.

530
00:26:27,435 --> 00:26:30,944
Peck : We are 
investigating an issue with

531
00:26:30,944 --> 00:26:36,293
the track pad on Linux for 
laptops with track pads.

532
00:26:36,293 --> 00:26:38,181
There's a little issue there.

533
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,255
A little oversensitive, you might say.

534
00:26:40,255 --> 00:26:41,327
Franzke: You make a change and like,

535
00:26:41,327 --> 00:26:42,649
oh, it works on Windows 
and then you go into Linux.

536
00:26:42,649 --> 00:26:44,834
Aaah! Gosh, it's broken.

537
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:46,115
What the hell is going on?

538
00:26:46,115 --> 00:26:48,364
Franzke: It was good to a 
have Beta release for sure,

539
00:26:48,364 --> 00:26:52,020
to kind of find a lot of issues 
and all the things we ran into,

540
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,797
we were not unprepared 
for, but we didn't expect.

541
00:26:54,797 --> 00:26:58,982
Like a lot of Window compatibility 
issue than we expected, for example.

542
00:26:58,982 --> 00:27:01,116
And you know, that's 
why I have those guys here,

543
00:27:01,116 --> 00:27:02,978
like we had a lot of 
issues with compatibility,

544
00:27:02,978 --> 00:27:05,794
so we ordered a lot of 
graphics cards just to kind of,

545
00:27:05,794 --> 00:27:09,536
trying to reproduce some of the 
issues that users were running into.

546
00:27:09,536 --> 00:27:11,565
Franzke: Oh, this is what 
compatibility is all about.

547
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:12,980
Finding really, really old hardware

548
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,055
and putting in your machine 
and see what happens.

549
00:27:17,055 --> 00:27:18,817
Franzke: You know, 
where here in the studio

550
00:27:18,817 --> 00:27:20,547
we didn't really have any 
problems running the game

551
00:27:20,547 --> 00:27:22,454
and like our external 
QA partner

552
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:23,871
didn't have any problem 
running the game,

553
00:27:23,871 --> 00:27:28,119
but then as soon as we, you know, 
we launched it on, you know,

554
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:30,951
on the day for the backers, 
like immediately people came back,

555
00:27:30,951 --> 00:27:34,438
oh, the game is crashing or sending 
out a black screen and stuff like that.

556
00:27:34,438 --> 00:27:35,538
That's always like, crap.

557
00:27:35,538 --> 00:27:37,781
If we would not have done it like that,

558
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,276
we would have eventually run
into this issues so you know,

559
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:42,962
on the 28th we would 
have released the game

560
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:45,714
and people would have had 
big problems with it and like,

561
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:48,543
while crashes are not great,

562
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:50,120
but at least acceptable during a Beta,

563
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,060
like once the game is out there, 
you know, it becomes very less acceptable.

564
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,468
Franzke: This VGA out. 
Haven't seen that in a while.

565
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,947
I don't know if it's even still possible.

566
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:04,355
Franzke: I had, I think 
two crashes on Windows 98.

567
00:28:04,355 --> 00:28:06,494
I mean, I was surprised 
that you managed to

568
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:09,507
download Steam on that machine, I guess.

569
00:28:09,507 --> 00:28:12,220
But yeah, unfortunately the game 
does not run on Windows 98

570
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,470
and I don't think it's part of 
the minimum requirement.

571
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,592
But yeah, that was, that was certainly 
very funny and surprising for sure.

572
00:28:23,256 --> 00:28:25,539
Franzke: I knock on the 
graphics card right here.

573
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:30,040
Romero: And for right now we're 
in shooting crashes and blockers

574
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,607
and people's progress is lost, 
saved and corrupted stuff like that.

575
00:28:33,607 --> 00:28:37,344
I mean, for now it's like the 
forum is the bug list pretty much,

576
00:28:37,344 --> 00:28:39,135
'cause there's so much coming in.

577
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:43,294
So before I was in, you know, 
I was looking through our bugs

578
00:28:43,294 --> 00:28:47,012
and now I'm looking 
through all these bugs.

579
00:28:47,012 --> 00:28:48,127
Now they're the testers.

580
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:49,601
They're reporting the bugs to us.

581
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:54,562
We're merely the conduit through which, 
you know, we get the bugs to developer.

582
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:56,014
Lui: It's nice, I think,

583
00:28:56,014 --> 00:29:01,586
for the team to have an overview 
of how the overall progress is going.

584
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:04,933
So it's nice to be able to see, 
like look at the chart and be like,

585
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:08,286
oh, we are constantly going down.

586
00:29:08,286 --> 00:29:13,582
And there are spikes, like this spike 
over there is when Tim played through

587
00:29:13,582 --> 00:29:19,872
the game twice and submitted 
about fifteen pages of bug fixes.

588
00:29:19,872 --> 00:29:22,466
Schafer: Should realize 
that it's gotta be done this week.

589
00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:24,839
So if there's anything that 
I really care about getting fixed,

590
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:27,379
I have to make a big 
stink about it right now.

591
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:31,735
But making big stinks 
is what I'm all about.

592
00:29:31,735 --> 00:29:37,456
The camera's here and then 
when I click, ah, the camera moves.

593
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:40,377
So annoying.

594
00:29:40,377 --> 00:29:44,696
Vella's first step makes camera twitch.

595
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:46,400
At the end of the game, 
there's just a million bugs

596
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,211
with things flashing or 
twitching for one frame.

597
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:50,576
Drives me nuts.

598
00:29:50,576 --> 00:29:51,735
When she gives him the cupcake,

599
00:29:51,735 --> 00:29:54,735
that's where the cupcake appears 
floating in midair for one frame.

600
00:29:54,735 --> 00:29:57,836
Yep. The average player 
can't say what happened,

601
00:29:57,836 --> 00:29:59,374
but they'll just get 
this weird twitchy feeling

602
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:01,041
when they're playing 
the game of like, aaah,

603
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:03,990
something was just, it's like, 
just a feeling of it not being polished.

604
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,393
But I can see, like OK, that 
camera was wrong for one frame.

605
00:30:07,393 --> 00:30:09,009
Sometimes I can't even 
tell if I saw a flash.

606
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:11,029
Like at the end of that cutscene, 
I swear I saw a flash.

607
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:14,181
I'm trying to fix everything.

608
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:16,149
You can't fix everything.

609
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,229
The mouse sensitivity 
is weird, though.

610
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:29,884
Peck: Myself, I've been, I got 
a couple of small little crashes in the UI,

611
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:32,686
stuff like that, that I've been fixing.

612
00:30:32,686 --> 00:30:36,034
And but yeah, mostly like, 
these are my bugs right now.

613
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:41,475
They all fit on one span of the window, 
so it's like, things are going well.

614
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:44,254
Schafer: How many 
bugs are left in Bugzilla?

615
00:30:44,254 --> 00:30:46,486
Is it really a sizeable amount still?

616
00:30:48,363 --> 00:30:51,588
Crook: Yeah. I mean these are all, 
they're all, they're, most of them are minor.

617
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:53,236
Schafer: Who's making all these bugs?

618
00:30:53,236 --> 00:30:54,134
Crook: I mean they're just minor

619
00:30:54,134 --> 00:30:57,344
but we know the game's coming 
out again, you know, as the final.

620
00:30:57,344 --> 00:31:00,894
So, so we just want to 
make it as good as we can.

621
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:04,646
We're going to be, most of 
us will roll off on Monday,

622
00:31:04,646 --> 00:31:07,153
onto other things for a while.

623
00:31:07,153 --> 00:31:08,124
And come back.

624
00:31:08,124 --> 00:31:09,167
Schafer: OK, great.

625
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,411
Crook: We're going to have to 
assess at the end of the month,

626
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:18,493
we got to figure out how much 
work is ready to just start doing.

627
00:31:19,654 --> 00:31:24,352
Crook: Sorry. So yeah.

628
00:31:24,352 --> 00:31:27,785
Which, you know, some of the script 
is written but there's still more to go.

629
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:32,418
So I'm not sure how much work 
there will be, just for the first,

630
00:31:32,418 --> 00:31:33,785
you know, couple weeks.

631
00:31:33,785 --> 00:31:36,159
So we got to keep people busy, though.

632
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,234
We had three of our animators 
actually go off the project now,

633
00:31:39,234 --> 00:31:41,359
so they've moved onto other projects.

634
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,137
Roberts: I'm leaving Broken Age.

635
00:31:43,137 --> 00:31:47,528
Because I'm moving onto 
another unannounced project.

636
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:54,033
And they'll be, the rest of the Broken 
Age team that's left on that project,

637
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:57,205
they're going to continue 
on Broken Age Part Two.

638
00:31:57,205 --> 00:32:00,834
So yeah, the nature of 
this new project is such

639
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:06,887
that I don't see myself going over 
and helping out on Act Two at all.

640
00:32:06,887 --> 00:32:11,725
But you know, that's famous 
last words, so it could happen.

641
00:32:11,725 --> 00:32:13,942
I would love to, at 
least animate something,

642
00:32:13,942 --> 00:32:17,348
but we are getting pretty busy 
around here with other things

643
00:32:17,348 --> 00:32:23,410
so yeah, that, that 
I can't see happening.

644
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,844
Offscreen Voice: 
Was it nice while it lasted?

645
00:32:24,844 --> 00:32:26,257
Roberts: It was, yeah, yeah.

646
00:32:26,257 --> 00:32:31,356
It was a nice, I wasn't really 
expecting to work on this project at all,

647
00:32:31,356 --> 00:32:32,785
so it was kind of a nice surprise.

648
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:35,920
And it was something 
that I wanted to work on.

649
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,476
Of course, you know, everyone here 
wanted to, well, most people here,

650
00:32:39,476 --> 00:32:40,752
I can't say everyone,

651
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:42,389
but most people here 
wanted to, you know,

652
00:32:42,389 --> 00:32:44,477
at least put their 
hands on this because,

653
00:32:44,477 --> 00:32:48,399
just because it made 
history for you know,

654
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,589
not to sound too grandiose about 
it, but that's what it did, right?

655
00:32:52,589 --> 00:32:55,332
I mean, there is history 
that was made here.

656
00:32:55,332 --> 00:32:59,365
And so everyone that saw that, 
you know, thinks wow, yeah,

657
00:32:59,365 --> 00:33:04,721
that's something I at least want 
to put something in there.

658
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:12,447
So OK. Goodbye, Broken Age.

659
00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:19,498
Goodbye 2HB. Goodbye, Maya.

660
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:23,148
Goodbye Double Fine.

661
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:25,389
Schafer: So we'll launch the 
game tomorrow and hopefully

662
00:33:25,389 --> 00:33:29,653
if we're not all here fixing bugs, 
we'll get to go out and have another,

663
00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:31,982
we'll go back to Red's, I hope.

664
00:33:31,982 --> 00:33:33,994
If it's still standing.

665
00:33:33,994 --> 00:33:35,829
And take the team out for drinks.

666
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:39,012
And before they all roll off, 
temporarily, onto other projects,

667
00:33:39,012 --> 00:33:41,230
I'd like to have them all hang out.

668
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,125
Go have a drink and celebrate.

669
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:47,052
'Cause it's weird, it's like, you wish 
these launches were super-clean,

670
00:33:47,052 --> 00:33:49,622
like everyone could just 
say, everything was great!

671
00:33:49,622 --> 00:33:52,466
So hopefully, I mean, time 
usually just washes away

672
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:53,864
all the smaller things that happened,

673
00:33:53,864 --> 00:33:58,428
like that embargo thing and all 
that other stuff will be forgotten.

674
00:33:58,428 --> 00:34:03,160
And people will just remember how 
we didn't have mouse sensitivity

675
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,440
when we launched and now we do.

676
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,960
No, that won't be the thing. Maybe.

677
00:34:09,835 --> 00:34:13,161
Rice: It's Elijah Wood's birthday today. 
Bailey: Oh wow.

678
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:16,020
Rice: So this is a good birthday present, right? 
Bailey: Yeah.

679
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:19,190
Rice: Tim, call Elijah and wish 
and wish him a happy birthday.

680
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,978
Schafer: Call him? Rice: Yeah, 
like you do with your mom.

681
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:25,118
Schafer: Hey, Elijah! 
Happy birthday. Oh, shoot.

682
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,340
[Phone rings]

683
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:31,458
Bailey: Yeah. It's interesting, though.

684
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:34,336
You think about Tim, like he's been 
working on this game for two years.

685
00:34:34,337 --> 00:34:37,802
It's now being commercially 
released but so much goes into,

686
00:34:37,802 --> 00:34:39,829
you know, the lead up to this.

687
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:40,949
And I guess I could understand.

688
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:43,287
It's a little anti-climactic 
when you sit here

689
00:34:43,288 --> 00:34:47,525
and you just kind of like refresh 
the webpage and look at numbers.

690
00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:52,177
The interesting thing about price, though, 
is you know, we can charge 29 bucks

691
00:34:52,178 --> 00:34:55,686
and because I used to 
actually work with, you know,

692
00:34:55,686 --> 00:35:00,145
at a publisher who did, you 
know, significant retail presence,

693
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:03,479
I know the PNLs and like, 
literally our profit margin

694
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:08,178
and the profit margin we 
have for like a $59 box product,

695
00:35:08,178 --> 00:35:11,399
are the same thing, because with 
the box product you got to like,

696
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:12,469
you got preprint the stuff.

697
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:17,349
You got all the materials, you got to 
ship it and you got to store it, you know.

698
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:19,094
The extra store will take their cut.

699
00:35:19,094 --> 00:35:21,623
There will be price protection involved.

700
00:35:21,623 --> 00:35:24,156
There's a huge amount of 
expense that goes into it.

701
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:27,612
That like, yeah.

702
00:35:27,612 --> 00:35:29,449
Profit margins are equal.

703
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:34,569
So we just got a lot, 
we got rid of a lot of waste.

704
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:36,689
Oh, there it is.

705
00:35:36,689 --> 00:35:38,447
Rice: All right, Justin. We're live.

706
00:35:38,447 --> 00:35:39,749
Bailey: I see it.

707
00:35:39,749 --> 00:35:41,454
Rice: I'm going to push the update.

708
00:35:41,454 --> 00:35:45,065
Bailey: Good. Do it.

709
00:35:45,065 --> 00:35:47,663
Bailey: And it's interesting, 'cause they'd 
like, when you get in a top position,

710
00:35:47,663 --> 00:35:49,425
it's probably at least a 
hundred, a hundred thousand,

711
00:35:49,425 --> 00:35:51,133
a hundred fifty thousand dollars.

712
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:54,408
But it actually could be way north 
of that and I'd have no idea,

713
00:35:54,408 --> 00:35:56,937
because you're number one, right?

714
00:35:56,937 --> 00:35:59,655
So you could be very, very high up.

715
00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:01,716
But that would be, that would 
be an amazing day for us,

716
00:36:01,716 --> 00:36:03,926
we could, we get in that top position.

717
00:36:03,926 --> 00:36:06,846
Schafer: Sitting at my desk, looking at 
a picture of me sitting at my desk.

718
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,600
[Hums to self]

719
00:36:15,532 --> 00:36:18,745
Bailey: It's about an hour 
and twenty minutes delayed.

720
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:25,516
Bailey: Yeah. That will be when 
we actually see something.

721
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:29,181
I'll know at 11:00, 11:30 
I'll have like the first indication.

722
00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:32,801
I think the hour of celebration 
or reckoning or both has come.

723
00:36:35,144 --> 00:36:36,401
Schafer: No, it's not Raz.

724
00:36:36,401 --> 00:36:39,092
I don't see any boobs 
or penises on anything.

725
00:36:39,092 --> 00:36:40,312
Choy: You have to look more closely.

726
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,020
Are you guys doing a standup?

727
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,000
Schafer: We are going to do 
standups. Standups? Rice: Yeah.

728
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,141
Schafer: Whoever's left, whoever's left 
on the team, come on to standups.

729
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:55,357
We're now live for everybody in the 
world to buy the game on Steam.

730
00:36:55,357 --> 00:36:56,818
That's it. That's all I 
had to say today.

731
00:36:56,818 --> 00:36:59,368
OK. So Part Two.

732
00:36:59,368 --> 00:37:00,248
It's like a back massage.

733
00:37:00,248 --> 00:37:01,620
Bailey: Oh yeah, it's pretty good.
That's not bad.

734
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,920
It's not, it's not as good now.

735
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,084
Schafer: It feels nice, yeah.

736
00:37:10,084 --> 00:37:12,997
Schafer: So if the sales aren't good, 
I'll immediately smash your head with this

737
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,825
so that you won't ever feel 
the pain of seeing bad sales.

738
00:37:15,825 --> 00:37:17,376
Bailey: That's good. Deal.

739
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,383
All right, we doing this?

740
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:25,688
Let's do, let's first just look 
at the, let's see, Top Ten List.

741
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:27,103
Schafer: I'm not going to look.

742
00:37:27,103 --> 00:37:28,083
Bailey: Not looking at Top Ten List?

743
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,120
Schafer: I don't care.

744
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,319
I'm not going to look.

745
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:32,019
Oh, oh! Look at that! Schafer: Holy cow!

746
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:35,034
Bailey: You're number 
two on new releases.

747
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:37,483
That has no component to sales.

748
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:41,257
But top sellers, we are number four.

749
00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:43,871
All right. Whoa!

750
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:45,271
Oh, this is refreshed, the new releases.

751
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,500
Still number four. OK, cool. Sweet!

752
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:54,496
Fifty thousand, five ninety-nine.

753
00:37:54,496 --> 00:37:57,885
That is 2,000 units on Steam. 
Schafer: Hm?

754
00:37:57,885 --> 00:38:00,023
Bailey: That's 2,000 units on Steam.

755
00:38:00,023 --> 00:38:01,158
Yeah, this is good.

756
00:38:01,158 --> 00:38:02,567
This will, this will be good.

757
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:05,687
If we get over 100K today, 
I think that's a, it's a very good day

758
00:38:05,687 --> 00:38:09,722
and I expect that European 
sales usually hit overnight.

759
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:11,782
So I would expect that to double.

760
00:38:13,736 --> 00:38:15,671
Schafer: Double today. Bailey: Yeah.

761
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:16,814
Schafer: By the end of the day.

762
00:38:16,814 --> 00:38:18,178
Bailey: Between now 
and the end of the day.

763
00:38:18,178 --> 00:38:19,479
Probably more than double.

764
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:23,723
This'll probably be like, 
I would say like 125 to 150,

765
00:38:23,723 --> 00:38:28,554
which means that would take us over 
nine million for Double Fine lifetime revenue.

766
00:38:28,554 --> 00:38:31,840
Schafer: Hm. 
Bailey: It should be very, very cool.

767
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,627
And I actually expect, I do 
expect the trend of the game to,

768
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:38,338
to stay, we'll have a spike right now,

769
00:38:38,338 --> 00:38:41,778
but I think it'll actually be pretty 
steady after that, so that's good.

770
00:38:45,052 --> 00:38:47,314
Schafer: OK. Now pretend the 
cameras are off now. Bailey: Now pretend?

771
00:38:47,314 --> 00:38:48,789
Schafer: Tell me what you really think.

772
00:38:48,789 --> 00:38:50,416
Bailey: It's, it is what I expected.

773
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:55,916
Schafer: OK. All right. Exciting. Cool.

774
00:38:57,852 --> 00:38:59,178
Now I don't want anyone to look at it.

775
00:38:59,178 --> 00:39:01,838
I guess I'll go deisgn 
Act Two. Bailey: Yeah.

776
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,995
Offscreen Voice: It's 
not earth shattering.

777
00:39:04,588 --> 00:39:08,581
Bailey: It's not earth shattering, but it's 
on track to do what we need it to do,

778
00:39:08,581 --> 00:39:11,901
you know, to get the 
game finished this year.

779
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:15,941
The only unfortunate part 
about this whole thing is that

780
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:18,628
I was looking at 
all of our news broadcasts

781
00:39:18,628 --> 00:39:21,341
and basically, you know, 
basic, all the news,

782
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:25,488
all the exposure went out when 
the backers got it, like two weeks ago.

783
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,977
And people didn't have a 
chance to literally like, you know,

784
00:39:28,977 --> 00:39:32,648
hey, I'll, I'll buy it now 
and I can play it now.

785
00:39:32,648 --> 00:39:39,577
You know, that's hard to, as like a, 
you know, value proposition for consumer,

786
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,600
it's hard to see everybody 
talking about this and be like,

787
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,963
oh, I can pay for it and 
still not get to play it.

788
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:48,063
But it'll hopefully come out in the wash.

789
00:39:55,221 --> 00:39:59,801
Rice: It was the last, 
I think it was very last bar.

790
00:40:03,886 --> 00:40:08,052
Schafer: I think we can confirm now 
that we chose the right code name.

791
00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:11,299
It didn't sound like the right code 
name, but now look at it; Red's.

792
00:40:11,299 --> 00:40:32,887
[Music]

793
00:40:32,887 --> 00:40:35,980
Schafer: Yeah. Let's talk about that.

794
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,483
We shipped Red's last week.

795
00:40:37,483 --> 00:40:38,544
I don't know if you guys noticed that.

796
00:40:38,544 --> 00:40:40,193
We shipped the game, it was awesome.

797
00:40:40,193 --> 00:40:41,364
Yah, Red's.

798
00:40:41,364 --> 00:40:43,079
[Applause].

799
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:46,121
It has, everybody 
claps just for shipping it.

800
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:48,891
I think I've gotten claps 
out of you guys for like...

801
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,406
Schafer: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

802
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,235
And next week we're shipping Red's.

803
00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:56,644
Next week it'll mean two 
weeks since we shipped Red's.

804
00:40:56,644 --> 00:41:02,279
It has, it has made about $800,000 
so far on the old Steam thing, which is fun.

805
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:06,038
And so that is an interesting number,

806
00:41:06,038 --> 00:41:09,578
because it was kind of a relief in 
one hand because we were like,

807
00:41:09,578 --> 00:41:12,504
get a lot of possibilities here, one of 
them is that we don't make any money.

808
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:14,275
No one buys the game, 
we can't make Part Two.

809
00:41:14,275 --> 00:41:17,554
But I think we, luckily, because that would 
have been an easy update, though.

810
00:41:17,554 --> 00:41:19,166
We would have called 
all the haters on Twitter

811
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:23,240
and just been like, you 
guys were totally right.

812
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,804
I'm a huge a-hole and we're 
not going to do Part Two.

813
00:41:25,804 --> 00:41:28,701
But that doesn't seem 
to be a risk anymore.

814
00:41:28,701 --> 00:41:31,257
We are also kind of hoping like, 
what if it made so much money

815
00:41:31,257 --> 00:41:33,370
that we didn't ever have 
to make games anymore?

816
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,881
We could just hang around and 
play games all day in the office.

817
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,314
Schafer: And we also don't make Act Two.

818
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,280
Yeah, either way Act Two is like.

819
00:41:43,591 --> 00:41:49,213
Yeah, I mean, that's not a big enough 
number that we're going to be immediately,

820
00:41:49,213 --> 00:41:52,019
completely independent 
of publishers this year,

821
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:54,438
like it was a secret back 
in my head, kind of hope.

822
00:41:54,438 --> 00:41:57,043
Where all my hopes are 
in the back of my head.

823
00:41:57,043 --> 00:41:58,554
Any other questions?

824
00:42:04,485 --> 00:42:10,028
Schafer: It's just under 
20,000, I think. So, so far.

825
00:42:11,424 --> 00:42:14,084
Schafer: We are. Yeah, so that's 
just to finish the whole Red's update.

826
00:42:14,084 --> 00:42:17,308
What the team is working on now is 
a lot of, instead of diving into Part Two,

827
00:42:17,308 --> 00:42:18,499
is actually platform work.

828
00:42:18,499 --> 00:42:25,139
You get it out on more platforms to sell 
it on like IOS and the other platforms.

829
00:42:29,658 --> 00:42:32,215
Schafer: Sooner than we had 
previously thought we were going to do it.

830
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:35,012
Skillman: So it would be 
Act One available on iOS.

831
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:37,613
Schafer: Yeah. OK. Let's talk about PR.

832
00:42:37,613 --> 00:42:39,345
PR. What happened in 
the world of PR last week?

833
00:42:39,345 --> 00:42:41,246
Rice: Well, like you said 
we launched Broken Age.

834
00:42:41,246 --> 00:42:43,308
So it's been a lot of, yay! Yay!

835
00:42:43,308 --> 00:42:46,411
[Applause].

836
00:42:46,411 --> 00:42:48,001
Yeah. So it's been trying to keep

837
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:50,917
that conversation going in 
the public as much as possible.

838
00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:53,463
So those are ongoing 
kind of conversations.

839
00:42:53,463 --> 00:42:57,172
But yeah, now we're kind 
of shifting focus to AF stuff

840
00:42:57,172 --> 00:43:00,561
and getting everything ready 
to announce and launch that thing.

841
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,860
Schafer: Yeah, OK, that's it.

842
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,540
I think all of you would agree with 
me that Chris Remo's a big jerk.

843
00:43:08,943 --> 00:43:10,548
I think, yeah.

844
00:43:10,548 --> 00:43:13,305
[Scattered applause]

845
00:43:13,305 --> 00:43:16,043
And furthermore we were all talking 
about it and decided we didn't like him.

846
00:43:16,043 --> 00:43:20,164
So I don't want that to influence you 
at all, but I think we need to have,

847
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:24,103
Chris Remo is moving onto 
hang out with his friends,

848
00:43:24,103 --> 00:43:26,873
which is bad news for all of 
his, whatever you guys are.

849
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,500
But, I've been saving that one all week.

850
00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:37,426
So, but you're still here right now so,

851
00:43:37,426 --> 00:43:41,663
what happened last week in the world 
of the community of Double Fine?

852
00:43:41,663 --> 00:43:43,570
Remo: An important 
thing for our community

853
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:49,410
is that we launched 
Broken Age [applause].

854
00:43:52,472 --> 00:43:55,852
That actually has been a cool thing 
to see because I'm seeing a lot of stuff

855
00:43:55,852 --> 00:43:59,756
from people who have never even 
necessarily played adventure games before.

856
00:43:59,756 --> 00:44:01,349
Schafer: I love all those people.

857
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:03,382
Remo: Yeah. I mean there's, it's 
actually been kind of awesome to see,

858
00:44:03,382 --> 00:44:06,657
because a lot of them, you know, 
like with adventure game fans,

859
00:44:06,657 --> 00:44:10,420
people come to, people come 
to it with like preconceptions

860
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,159
and like all the, you know, the history 
that they have with the genre.

861
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:14,616
And that's cool 
because that's the people

862
00:44:14,616 --> 00:44:16,765
that the game was 
inspired by in the first place.

863
00:44:16,765 --> 00:44:19,579
But it's also really cool to see 
all the reactions from people

864
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:24,070
who don't have those preconceptions, 
because they'll be like, yeah,

865
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,033
so I was playing this thing

866
00:44:25,033 --> 00:44:26,778
and like I didn't know what it 
was and it seemed pretty cool.

867
00:44:26,778 --> 00:44:29,450
You just kind of walk around 
and like cool stuff happens.

868
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,370
And like it was actually really awesome.

869
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:34,511
And that kind of thing 
is surprisingly cool to read.

870
00:44:34,511 --> 00:44:36,241
So I've been trying to 
keep up with that stuff,

871
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:40,426
just around the web and it's 
been really inspiring and awesome.

872
00:44:40,426 --> 00:44:41,046
Schafer: Anything else?

873
00:44:41,046 --> 00:44:45,026
Mr. Remo? Anything? Anything else.

874
00:44:45,026 --> 00:44:46,913
Remo: I will miss you guys a lot.

875
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,829
I really loved working here a 
lot and I'm bummed to be leaving.

876
00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:51,479
Schafer: Well, we'll 
miss you, wish you well

877
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,531
and we still think you're a big jerk.

878
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,691
Who agrees with me?

879
00:44:56,691 --> 00:45:01,401
[Applause]

880
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:38,341
[Music]

881
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,942
Offscreen Voice: [singing] I guess 
he's not a monster, but he's so far away.

882
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:56,160
Shay, we're meant to 
be for longer than forever.

883
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,683
Offscreen Voice: Who cares about Shay?

884
00:45:57,683 --> 00:45:59,339
I have evil deeds to do.

885
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,072
I used to be good like 
everyone else and Shay, but no!

886
00:46:03,335 --> 00:46:05,475
I am actually evil.

887
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,111
Offscreen Voice: [singing] 
for longer than forever.

888
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,434
As constant as the stars.

889
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:18,734
I close my eyes and I am where you are.
