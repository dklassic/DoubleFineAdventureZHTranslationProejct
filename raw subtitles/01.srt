1
00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:35,274
Schafer: I need to get accustomed
to money being around.

2
00:00:35,274 --> 00:00:37,002
That's the thing.

3
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:38,851
This is for the therapy,
the physical therapy

4
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:41,029
of getting me used to actually
not being afraid of money.

5
00:00:41,029 --> 00:00:43,249
Offscreen voice: Richard Branson
does the same thing.

6
00:00:43,249 --> 00:00:46,755
Schafer: Ah! You guys, what is
this stuff that's all over me?

7
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,287
Offscreen voice: Beautiful.

8
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:49,552
Schafer: I can't apply it to myself..

9
00:00:49,552 --> 00:00:50,632
Offscreen voice: Oh my God.

10
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:52,113
Schafer: I can't self-terminate.

11
00:00:52,113 --> 00:00:53,470
Offscreen voice: Help me apply money.

12
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,872
Schafer: I can't self-monetize.

13
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,120
Schafer: So this is a more recent,
uh point-and-click adventure game.

14
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:28,697
I have to show you someone else's,

15
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:29,962
because I haven't made
one in a long time.

16
00:01:29,962 --> 00:01:31,565
I used to make them back in the '90s.

17
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:33,569
This is Machinarium.

18
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:35,512
You role play this little
robot and you click around.

19
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,546
And these kind of games,
you walk the character around

20
00:01:37,546 --> 00:01:41,245
by clicking on the ground somewhere
and pull on this handle here.

21
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:43,987
And then I can make this mine
cart come through the room.

22
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:45,529
Shahani: I'm sorry. What's that?

23
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:47,657
Schafer: I pulled this handle,
oh, that's right.

24
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:49,968
This doesn't work until I do this.

25
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:52,188
That's what a lot of adventure
game playing is like.

26
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:54,622
You're like, oh, this doesn't,
why doesn't this work?

27
00:01:54,622 --> 00:01:56,166
Oh, I need this gear first.

28
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,984
I need to get the gear on the sprocket.

29
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,710
And so they're, they
move at a slower pace.

30
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,775
And some people really like that.

31
00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:05,782
But it also means they're not
exactly as attention-getting

32
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:10,126
and as visceral and maybe as a
big block buster action game.

33
00:02:10,126 --> 00:02:12,745
And it led us to this point
now where it's really hard

34
00:02:12,745 --> 00:02:14,565
to get one of these games
made these days,

35
00:02:14,565 --> 00:02:17,308
or at least get funding
for it from a publisher.

36
00:02:17,308 --> 00:02:20,513
Shahani: Before getting into all that,
what put you on the map?

37
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:24,919
Like, just describe the game
that got you into game famous.

38
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,615
Schafer: Game famous.

39
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:29,142
You know, we just, each
game we made in the '90s,

40
00:02:29,142 --> 00:02:30,807
we got a little more recognition for it.

41
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:33,417
And we were always pretty savvy
about getting our names on the box,

42
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:34,995
you know, so we're, hey.

43
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:39,305
You know, you have to kind of act
like you're famous before you're famous.

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,520
That sounds funny.

45
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,280
I learned that from an interview with
David Lee Roth about Van Halen.

46
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:47,230
Like we always acted
like we were hot shit.

47
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,357
We had a big hit, Full Throttle,

48
00:02:49,357 --> 00:02:51,145
it's called Full Throttle and
it sold a million copies

49
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:54,257
and that was really big for
those PC graphic adventures.

50
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,385
And then I made a game
called Grim Fandango

51
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,941
and that won Game of
the Year with Game Spot

52
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:01,347
and that was the big
thing that helped a lot.

53
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:05,978
Grim Fandango is set in the
Land of the Dead, yeah.

54
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:09,215
And it was, it sold
about half a million units

55
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:12,050
and it was seen as not
being commercially successful.

56
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,792
And it was one of the reasons
 that adventure games died.

57
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:17,413
I mean, I heard a friend of mine,
who worked in another game company,

58
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:19,468
saying we tried to get
an adventure game made

59
00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:23,350
and they said, well look, you know,
Grim Fandango didn't do that well.

60
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,493
So obviously, you know, it was
a good game, it won Game of the Year.

61
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:28,313
And if Game of the Year can't sell,

62
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:31,610
you know, as many copies as it
needs to, then maybe that genre's dead.

63
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:37,750
So I feel some responsibility to make
a good game and make it do well.

64
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,180
Rice: He's been excited about it.

65
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,720
I mean, he's wanted to return to
adventure games for a while

66
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:46,947
and it's just been a matter of not
knowing how to make that happen.

67
00:03:46,947 --> 00:03:50,398
Schafer: But fans are always saying
they would want, they want one,

68
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:53,756
but a publisher would say, we
can't make money doing those.

69
00:03:53,756 --> 00:03:56,777
So something like Kickstarter shows up,

70
00:03:56,777 --> 00:04:00,773
which is this crowd sourcing website,
where everybody can back a project.

71
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:04,367
You pitch your project and you get
backers and then if you meet your goals,

72
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:06,310
you get the money and
you build your project.

73
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,401
Doing an adventure game is interesting,

74
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:10,468
because it's the only, like the
only way you could do that,

75
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:14,319
letting the fans like, kind of put
their money where their mouth is.

76
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,738
Is it that? Wait a second.

77
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:17,219
Did I get that backwards? Yeah.

78
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:18,267
Host: No, you're right. Yeah.

79
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:19,994
Some loud mouth fan, no,
I don't want to buy Trenched,

80
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:21,476
but what about an adventure game?

81
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:23,541
Schafer: Exactly.

82
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,837
Shahani: Explain your
Kickstarter campaign.

83
00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:26,596
What have you just done?

84
00:04:26,596 --> 00:04:29,676
Schafer: Yeah. What have we done?

85
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:31,835
Schafer: Oh, sorry.
I didn't see you there.

86
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:35,184
You caught me indulging in one
of my many impressive hobbies.

87
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:36,727
I'm Tim Schafer.

88
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:39,223
Schafer: And so we put a pitch video
up where we said we want to make a game.

89
00:04:39,223 --> 00:04:42,027
And the idea was, what if we made
one of these adventure games

90
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:44,402
that most publishers don't
want to fund these days?

91
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:47,380
And one of my favorite types of
games to make is adventure games.

92
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,230
But these days, it seems
like adventure games

93
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,851
are almost a bit of a lost art form.

94
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:56,339
They exist in our dreams and
our memories and in Germany.

95
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:58,067
Schafer: Maybe that would
get people excited about

96
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:00,872
getting a chance to do something
that couldn't be funded any other way.

97
00:05:00,872 --> 00:05:02,168
Schafer: It's perfect.

98
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,863
We got the perfect team here
at Double Fine to make it.

99
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:06,386
We got the inventor of the
genre here, Ron Gilbert.

100
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:08,668
Oh, look! There he is right now.

101
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:11,438
Maybe he'll help us.

102
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,920
He'll help us.

103
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:16,158
Gilbert: You know, we've always
talked about wanting to do,

104
00:05:16,158 --> 00:05:18,686
you know, more classic adventure stuff.

105
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,752
And so doing the
Kickstarter thing, it's like,

106
00:05:20,752 --> 00:05:24,665
yeah, that sounds, I mean, that
sounds really like an interesting idea.

107
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:29,210
I think we were both very
skeptical about the amount of money.

108
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,354
Schafer: So, we are asking for
this much to make the game

109
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:34,327
and this much to film it.

110
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:35,961
And that may seem like a lot of money,

111
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,079
but it's really not that much for
a game budget these days.

112
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,683
It's pretty small, actually.

113
00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:41,399
Schafer: And I just never thought
you could get the kind of money

114
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,496
that would actually pay for
a whole game budget.

115
00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:45,715
Schafer: Hello, potential backers.

116
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:47,166
I could do all three options.

117
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,724
Thank you for donating well
over the amount we asked for.

118
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,989
That's so great.

119
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:53,085
We have too much money now.

120
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:54,288
Damn you!

121
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,755
Why haven't anyone given us any money?

122
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:58,297
I'm so sad.

123
00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:00,733
That doesn't seem believable.

124
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,265
Yeah, we're not going to use that one.

125
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:03,684
Or just moderately, hello.

126
00:06:03,684 --> 00:06:07,013
Thank you for dedicating
the appropriate amount of...

127
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:09,880
Schafer: Because the previous
projects in Kickstarter had only been,

128
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,514
I don't know what the
maximum was before then,

129
00:06:11,514 --> 00:06:13,796
but it looked like
they're like forty grand.

130
00:06:13,796 --> 00:06:17,494
You know, I mean, we're used to making
projects that were like, you know, Brütal.

131
00:06:17,494 --> 00:06:19,990
Like 20 million dollars and these
smaller games, like two million.

132
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,733
It was like, no way you can get
two million from Kickstarter.

133
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,031
Could you?

134
00:06:24,031 --> 00:06:25,480
Schafer: I hope this works out,
because it is kind of,

135
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,238
that enough people got together,

136
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:29,334
are they going to actually make
a game like this happen?

137
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:31,030
A game like, that we
haven't really been able to

138
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,760
make happen for business reasons
for like, many, many years.

139
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,934
Gilbert: Or we'll just prove
all those publishers right.

140
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:41,784
Schafer: Or we'll just
prove them all right.

141
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,920
Schafer: No, I mean
nothing I had done before

142
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,247
prepared me for what it's
like to work with publishers.

143
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:09,975
Rice: When you're
working with a publisher,

144
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:14,259
a lot of times they get
involved with design decisions.

145
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:16,816
And you have to make compromises.

146
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:19,314
Gilbert: You know, if
a publisher is out there,

147
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:23,229
from the outside kind of poking
in and making you do things.

148
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:26,219
You know, that's where I think
things can kind of come off the rails.

149
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:29,179
Schafer: And the way it felt,
I don't know if this makes any sense,

150
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:31,398
but my head, like the creative process
of making a game was like,

151
00:07:31,398 --> 00:07:34,603
you look at a field of
floating, multi-colored dots,

152
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:36,886
drifting slowly to the ground.

153
00:07:36,886 --> 00:07:38,613
And eventually when they hit the ground,

154
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:40,587
they're going to make like
a painting on the floor.

155
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:43,146
But you've got to kind of like move
them around, give them the right and see.

156
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:45,273
And then as they fall, you start
to see where you need more color

157
00:07:45,273 --> 00:07:50,081
and you move them around and
slowly they settle and you just add a sound.

158
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:51,376
And then you're done.

159
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:54,212
So it'd be like, Tim, what do
you do with that green dot?

160
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:55,632
Phew, I can't tell you.

161
00:07:55,632 --> 00:07:57,083
You're like, ok, that dot?

162
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,131
Can we just nail that down here.

163
00:07:58,131 --> 00:07:59,151
Can we just say what that's going to be?

164
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:00,200
And you're like, no.

165
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,558
So let's just say where all the
red dots are going to be, ok.

166
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:02,823
Could you just nail
all the red dots down?

167
00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:03,996
Like, no!

168
00:08:03,996 --> 00:08:05,476
How about if we just start on this edge

169
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:08,283
and we just take all the dots,
like this and just nail all those dots.

170
00:08:08,283 --> 00:08:09,546
No!

171
00:08:09,546 --> 00:08:11,491
Rice: Yeah. The games
industry as a whole, I think,

172
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,374
is in a really weird
spot where it's like we're,

173
00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:19,257
like the film industry used
to be way back in the day.

174
00:08:19,257 --> 00:08:21,909
Where the publishers are
running mostly everything.

175
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:23,913
That's kind of how it
was for a long time

176
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:26,410
and it's only now that
people are starting to like

177
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,175
seek out the creators of the games.

178
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,903
That people who are making the game

179
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:34,046
and try to actually support those
people and lift them up a bit.

180
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:38,197
Young Man: Because Tim Schafer
has consistently put out quality games.

181
00:08:38,197 --> 00:08:42,296
Man: Games that have very
large and dedicated followings.

182
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:46,303
Man: People would probably pay
him just to spit on their screen.

183
00:08:46,303 --> 00:08:48,215
Young Man: And we do appreciate that.

184
00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:51,020
We show our appreciation
by doing what we've done.

185
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,243
By giving them the funding
for this game in eight hours.

186
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,449
Rice: The whole like past month
has been like a complete blur.

187
00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:00,854
It's gone so quick.

188
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:05,447
But, yeah, we were in Vegas
for DICE the day that we launched.

189
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:08,960
Schafer: And we'd had a hard
month, because we had a game cancel.

190
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,687
The whole team, we're
trying to figure out

191
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:13,616
whether we could swing
having this team stay on

192
00:09:13,616 --> 00:09:17,006
or do we have to let go of twelve
people to keep the company afloat?

193
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:20,078
We've never laid off
anyone for money before.

194
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:24,424
So we were, and even besides
the financial concerns, it was just such a,

195
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:26,772
it doesn't feel like you're winning
when you have a game canceled.

196
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:30,532
You feel like it's a big,
you know, you've lost.

197
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:33,677
Schafer: I'm about to launch
our first Kickstarter project.

198
00:09:33,677 --> 00:09:36,606
Rice: It kind of just all came together
right when we were out there

199
00:09:36,606 --> 00:09:38,456
and we had a bit of time before
a meeting and we're like,

200
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:39,907
we could launch this today.

201
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:42,928
Schafer: Yeah, I did have to like
decide, well, we'll launch our Kickstarter.

202
00:09:42,928 --> 00:09:45,394
That, for time, we're
like I guess $200,000.

203
00:09:45,394 --> 00:09:47,305
We could make something for $200,000.

204
00:09:47,305 --> 00:09:51,159
And I had to accept it, I might
only get $200,000, right?

205
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:54,550
And then when I was nervous
about it, so I upped it to three, right.

206
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,002
And so it was like, yeah, we
can make something for $300,000.

207
00:09:58,002 --> 00:09:59,389
Because we could.

208
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:00,933
You know, we'd been talking
about iPhone games recently

209
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,645
and it's like three people for six
months or something like that.

210
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,435
Yeah, we could make something
with three people and six months.

211
00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:08,045
It would look like a flash game or
it'd look like an iPhone game,

212
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:11,581
but it would technically be a game.

213
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:13,811
By all scientific definitions.

214
00:10:13,811 --> 00:10:16,890
Schafer: I'm nervous.

215
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,400
Launch.

216
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,220
Review, i'll have to review it.

217
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,140
Rice: Oh, man.
That was such a letdown!

218
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,339
Schafer: OK. No, no,
that's just fine print.

219
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,329
It's just that I never
read these things.

220
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:33,471
Should I do it?

221
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:34,736
Rice: Yeah, do it.

222
00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:36,464
Schafer: It couldn't hurt, right?

223
00:10:36,464 --> 00:10:38,067
Rice: It could, but
we're not going to let it.

224
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:41,025
Schafer: Whoo!

225
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,374
Rice: I remember like as soon as we
hit it up and we refresh, it was like at $30.

226
00:10:45,374 --> 00:10:47,910
We're like, holy crap!
There's already $30.

227
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,409
Schafer: I think I'm going to look at
how much, I don't care about money.

228
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:55,405
I'm not going to look. I'm going
to look, just one second.

229
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,688
Rice: What are we at?

230
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:59,911
OK, so we posted this, what?
Two hours ago, right?

231
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:01,504
Schafer: Two hours ago.

232
00:11:01,504 --> 00:11:03,756
We launched our Kickstarter
project two hours ago.

233
00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:07,889
$106,000 in 56.

A hundred and six,
I can't count so high.

235

It's such a high number, that's crazy.

236
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,918
It's too much money.

237
00:11:14,918 --> 00:11:16,554
Rice: Yeah. So when we hit a million,

238
00:11:16,554 --> 00:11:19,637
that was definitely like,
that was the day after.

239
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,427
One day after we launched, right?

240
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:22,783

you guys and not for the money.

days, Tim Schafer from Double Fine

277
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,448
took crowd funding site,
Kickstarter to fund his next game.

278

Schafer: It feels like a happening.
You know what I mean?

279
00:13:12,638 --> 00:13:14,241

You get the million dollars.

284
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,541
Did you immediately withdraw it all?

into it like Scrooge McDuck style?

Kickstarter, it made it,

I don't know what it was,

288
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:32,901
but it made everyone just take
that big basket of money

289
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:34,805
and shake it out over our heads.

I told you, adventure
games are not dead!

297

The thing that I noticed was that

298
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,512
it was just such a morale
boost to the whole team.

299
00:14:19,512 --> 00:14:22,040
And you know, I think it just
felt like a lot of goodwill

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,123
and love coming towards the company
and everyone got super excited about it.

301
00:14:25,123 --> 00:14:26,944
And because it was like
this feeling of like,

302
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:29,071
we knew those people were
there, we knew they were.

303
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:31,199
But, because sometimes they don't
show up when you make a game.

304
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,804
You know, you make
a game, you release it,

going to sell a lot and it didn't.

those people that it feels like,

time since we had experience

314

where it felt like we were the winners.

315
00:14:57,586 --> 00:15:00,537
We were at DICE and I
was walking through DICE,

316
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:03,959
feeling like a winner,
which is really kind of like,

317
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:05,871
not that I feel like a loser,

318
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:11,539
but usually feel like the
alternative, alternative to money.

319
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,120
I mean i'm proud of all our games

320
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:23,377
and I wouldn't switch them
with anyone else's games,

321
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:25,105
but usually walking in
a convention like that,

322
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:27,233
you're talking to the, you know,
the people who made Uncharted

323
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:29,146
and they're, they're really
nice and you're like, ah.

325
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,323
Did really well for you.

00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:34,729
And like, you don't often feel like,

327
00:15:34,729 --> 00:15:38,767
you feel like they're like the family
member who's like still living at home.

328

You know, like yeah.

to us, but you know,

330
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,838
we haven't, it's different when
you make a bunch of money.

00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,980
Schafer: Is that auto refreshing?

334
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,480
Everyone: Yes.

335
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,840
Schafer: We were in the hotel room

336
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:56,572
and I was listening on
the Skype, on the iPad

337
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:58,207
and you just remember
like, click, click,

338
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:02,611
aha, aha, then all of a sudden, whooo!

339
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,980
Schafer: Distortion sound
as everyone lost their shit.

340
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,920
And right now we're at
almost 2.5 million dollars.

341
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:10,066
and we have six more days to go.

342
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:11,578
Rice, Offscreen: Everything
moved really quickly

343
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:13,243
and I actually didn't
really have a chance

344
00:16:13,243 --> 00:16:17,066
to like let everything sit in
until yesterday, when it finished.

345
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:21,073
And I was like, finally it like hit
me and it was like, holy crap.

346
00:16:21,073 --> 00:16:24,615
We did something really crazy here.

347
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,380
Schafer: 2 minutes!

348
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:30,336
[Crowd shouting and cheering]

349
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,080
So like we cleared in advance

350
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,400
I'm going to shake this up and 
I'm going to spray it all over your head.

351
00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:41,554
Why is that...

352
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,940
Ron!

353
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:45,309
My God, that's terrible for your teeth.

354
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:46,020
Offscreen: Two minutes!

355
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,280
Two minutes.

356
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:47,920
[Pop]

357
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,960
Offscreen: Premature! Premature!

358
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,974
Gilbert: There's still
a part of my skeptical

359
00:16:57,974 --> 00:17:01,272
pessimistic brain that says, well,
you can never do this again.

360
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:06,079
That this was really kind of this
one time perfect storm thing.

361
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,114
But I don't know. I mean, maybe not.

[Cheering]

364
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,879
I've been so happy about that

365
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:35,515
ever since Kickstarter started,

366
00:17:35,515 --> 00:17:37,672
just thinking about how, I
still have to answer to people.

367
00:17:37,672 --> 00:17:39,646
Like people funded the game, you know.

368
00:17:39,646 --> 00:17:41,827
But they're exactly the
people I want to answer to.

369
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,864
Those are the people
I'm making dots for, right?

370
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:46,197
And all those things
like, and so it's like,

371
00:17:46,197 --> 00:17:50,544
it's just this really liberating,

372
00:17:50,544 --> 00:17:52,455
freeing thing to just
think that I'm just going to

373
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:54,615
have to worry about how good
the game is, almost nothing else.

374

375
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,240
Schafer: I love you guys!

376
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,599
It has been an amazing
experience. So much love.

377
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:11,004
We know there's not, it's not
all about us and Double Fine,

378
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:13,747
but about you, the fans and
what you guys want to say

379
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:15,939
and do with your money and choose to do.

380
00:18:15,939 --> 00:18:18,375
And make things happen for yourself.

381
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,150
I mean, I don't want to
make a huge speech here,

382
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,785
because I'll be all choked up.

383
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:24,779
Gilbert: Too late.

384
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:27,431
Schafer: But I just, I don't
want to say this is the end of the,

385
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:29,837
you know, the whole game
industry as we know it.

386
00:18:29,837 --> 00:18:32,857
It's not, it's not.

387
00:18:32,857 --> 00:18:35,511
And it's not, again it's not
like we're total replacement

388
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:37,824
of all publishers and publishing games.

389
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:39,150
There's still going to be,

390
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,803
there still might be a few games
made by publishers after today.

391
00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:43,746
Just a couple games.

392
00:18:43,746 --> 00:18:46,891
But it does mean if you've ever been
told that your part of a niche market,

393
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:48,988
if you've ever like,
if you've ever like,

394
00:18:48,988 --> 00:18:50,808
when you're a kid and you had
your favorite TV show cancelled

395
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:52,658
or you hear about your favorite band

396
00:18:52,658 --> 00:18:54,386
being dropped by their label
for not selling enough

397
00:18:54,386 --> 00:18:56,576
and you've just been like why
does a big company get to choose

398
00:18:56,576 --> 00:18:58,734
what music I listen to
or what movies I watch

399
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:00,924
or what TV shows I watch
or what game I get to play,

400
00:19:00,924 --> 00:19:04,377
now you know that they
can't do that anymore.

401
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,784
You can choose. So thanks everybody.

403
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,940
Thank you to the team!

404
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,260
Everybody!

405
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,520
Thanks to my parents
for backing the project

406
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:21,335
and everybody else's parents
who backed the project.

407
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:24,939
Does anybody else want to thank anybody?

408
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,120
Kipnis: Thank you Tim!

409
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,220
Thank you!

410
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:30,984
Thanks everyone and now we dance.
