1
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,900
Stapley: Yeah, that's pretty.
Pretty colors.

2
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,320
Stapley: Yeah, I was
looking at the end there.

3
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,925
The 20th of September,
October, November, December,

4
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:33,733
January, February, March, April.

5
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,800
So yeah, everything looks cool here.

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,706
Yeah, those last
three months right there

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,760
seems like there's going
to be a lot of changing.

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,520
[Laughs}

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,060
From November to February
looks a little crazy.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah man. It's going to be pretty nuts.

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:16,880
[Music]

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:51,280
[quite fantasy music]

13
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,359
Petty: Well, then we need to
come up with another plan

14
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,196
because right now it's not possible.

15
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,620
There's just not, one artist can't be
the primary, like he's the, he's the,

16
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,878
you know, like literally he's the
renderer for every object in the game.

17
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,211
And do concept design
on the schedule we have.

18
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,767
Schafer: I think if I hadn't been
through the process before,

19
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:11,255
I'd think the project was
falling apart last month.

20
00:02:11,255 --> 00:02:14,283
It definitely is a little bit of a
tension as you switch gears

21
00:02:14,283 --> 00:02:15,964
and you're talking
about practical matters.

22
00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:20,345
But it wasn't that tense, you know.

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,838
Petty: For all the artists
involved but certainly for Bagel,

24
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,102
we're going to have make, you're
going to have decide, I guess,

25
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,120
which, what you want the hierarchy
of his time to be spent on.

26
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,000
[Ambient sci-fi music]

27
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,042
Schafer: I want him to come
up with both the, you know,

28
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:42,750
that really just like content
and then actual style, both.

29
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,704
Petty: There's other options there,
that we talked about all those options.

30
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:48,724
I don't think we've committed to
one particular solution yet.

31
00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:52,684
Rice: I think it's an ongoing
conversation, so not really.

32
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,342
Schafer: I mean yeah, we're doing,
since we're doing a game

33
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:08,768
that's like a different engine type
than we've ever done before, it's like 2D.

34
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:13,515
A whole different engine, new devices
we'd never worked on and an adventure game,

35
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,220
which we would have never made a
straight adventure game here at this company.

36
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,506
So we're doing so many new things
with this project that we're just learning.

37
00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:23,867
Every time we try to do something,
we find out like that's not going to work.

38
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,233
We do have to, of course, correct
and try different solutions.

39
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,920
But that's totally normal, expected.

40
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,960
Offscreen Voice: Don't
fuck with my wall.

41
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,240
Rice: But I mean, like a lot of it isn't
like, there's a problem, we're fucked.

42
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:39,555
It's like we need to
pay attention to this

43
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,540
and try to start figuring out
ways to make it work.

44
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,323
And we started thinking about
that and feeling more comfortable.

45
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,927
Schafer: Well, we have, we brought
on Levi and he's helping out.

46
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,476
Rice: We have some new people,

47
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,726
but like they're getting familiar
with everything pretty quickly.

48
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:58,301
Ryken: I was actually, on
Friday I was looking at this.

49
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,080
Just getting inspired.

50
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,383
This is the museum near Tokyo.

51
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:06,853
It's super cool and I went there
and I bought that there.

52
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,354
And for Friday, I just,

53
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,916
the first thing in the morning I was
getting inspired looking at that.

54
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,120
And then someone was
like, you know what?

55
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,026
They're playing a bunch of those right
now and apparently for like two weeks

56
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:20,879
they're playing all of
those studio Ghibli films.

57
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,180
And I'm just going to
be there every day.

58
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:26,434
It's happening right now. Yeah.

59
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,526
Over the weekend I
saw three: I saw Nausicaa,

60
00:04:28,526 --> 00:04:32,786
which is like a big inspiration for stuff
that we're doing right now.

61
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:34,059
[Offscreen] Yeah we just
watched that last week.

62
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:35,619
Really great, it's really great.

63
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,033
Rice: Yeah. We had
like another art slot.

64
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,000
We didn't know what we
were going to fill it with

65
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,140
and like right now it makes sense

66
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,240
because concepts the most needed
and that's why Levi's around.

67
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,148
But I mean, who knows?

68
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:54,244
Like later in the project we could be
ramping down on concept

69
00:04:54,244 --> 00:04:56,406
and need more animation
and have to switch it out.

70
00:04:56,406 --> 00:05:02,254
But yeah, we always had one other spot
for an artist and I'm glad that it was Levi.

71
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,305
Offscreen Voice: How far along did
Peter Chan get with his contributions?

72
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,960
Rice: How far did Peter get?

73
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,960
I think the last stuff that Peter did

74
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,600
was some environment
designs for spaceship stuff.

75
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,073
Schafer: All right. It's been
good talking to you, Peter.

76
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,851
Chan: Thank you again, you guys, for
everything and it was a lot of fun.

77
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,255
And to be part of it.

78
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:26,001
So thank you for inviting me.

79
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:29,201
Schafer: We'll see you again.
Petty: Thanks, Peter.

80
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:30,416
Rice: Yeah, it was a bit of a bummer.

81
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,386
I mean, he was offsite so it wasn't
like we were hanging out all the time,

82
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:36,493
which would have been super fun.

83
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,200
But still, like I did look
forward to every Friday,

84
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,400
getting like a drop of art from him.

85
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,789
But Levi's around so like having him right
next door and getting to see his stuff,

86
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:49,424
which has been like a totally different
take on it and you know,

87
00:05:49,424 --> 00:05:52,230
being able to hang out with him
in the office has been fun.

88
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,619
Rice: Yeah. I don't know if you
talked to Lee much about

89
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,337
what you're going to start
with, concept-wise.

90
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,071
Ryken: Yeah, I have concept
stuff for boy world stuff.

91
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,840
Rice: Did you check out
Peter's? Ryken: Yeah.

92
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,820
Rice: Yeah, are you scared?

93
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,080
It's a lot to live up to, man.

94
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,260
Ryken: I'll get out my tracing paper.

95
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,160
Rice: Yeah, I don't
think it works that way.

96
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,732
Ryken: Peter Chan did a
bunch of the early stuff

97
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,700
and I've been looking at
what he's been doing.

98
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:23,692
This is me, actually look at this.

99
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,980
That's bootleg P. Chan.

100
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,680
Schafer: And we have interviewed
an intern, an art intern.

101
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,863
I haven't met her yet, but everyone
seemed to like her and think she was good.

102
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,232
And that would help, too.

103
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,821
Offscreen Voice: Oh no, you filmed that!

104
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:43,701
Schafer: Please also join me in welcoming
Marius from Germany, where did he go...

105
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:45,700
There he is! Marius Fitz...

106
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,358
I'm going to have you
pronounce your last name.

107
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,887
Can you pronounce your last name for us?

108
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,880
Fietzek: Fietzek.

109
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,468
Schafer: You know, Marius was
the one who made an adventure game

110
00:06:54,468 --> 00:06:58,788
as a job application for Double Fine,
which seems very nice.

111
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,420
Fietzek: Hey, I heard about the
Double Fine Adventure and was super-hyped

112
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,066
and yeah, I thought like if I want to,

113
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:20,086
if there's a chance to work with my
idols on the 2D animated game,

114
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:23,726
then this is like the only
chance maybe ever.

115
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:30,886
So I made an, application video game.

116
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,180
Schafer: Our plan is to actually
release that as a Double Fine Adventure

117
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,835
and then pocket all
the Kickstarter money.

118
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,680
We'll give you a small percentage of it.

119
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,622
How long will Marius
be here, Mr. Greg Rice?

120
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,900
Rice: Three months.

121
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,802
Schafer: You get three months, holy cow.

122
00:07:46,802 --> 00:07:48,486
And what will he be doing?

123
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,220
Rice: Who knows? Schafer: Who knows.

124
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,040
Rice: Animating.
Schafer: You'll do some animating on Red's.

125
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,000
Fietzek: But I started with the
whole cinematic approach on

126
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,098
the very first cut scene,
just to see how it feels.

127
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,526
I thought of a very quiet start
where we first see the spaceship,

128
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:12,078
because I don't, I don't remember
a point at the space boy part

129
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,591
where we actually see the ship.

130
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,741
Schafer: Well, Marius is great.

131
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:19,185
Like he's like, he'll just show us,
you know, a story board

132
00:08:19,185 --> 00:08:21,385
and it's really hard to like
how someone do something

133
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:22,404
that's really great and really funny,

134
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:24,981
but just for what you were thinking
of it, maybe it's not right.

135
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,629
Schafer: And the same
way the girl starts.

136
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:30,713
She's just laying on the hillside
and it's not a cut scene,

137
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,482
but like a steady state;
you exit out of it by tapping.

138
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:34,657
And the same way with this.

139
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,056
It's really got to be that it
pans over and shows him

140
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,285
and he's laying there on the bed,
and the same kind of just, you know.

141
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,300
[Schafer] So you got to like tell him,

142
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,161
like I had to tell him like this
whole sequence was backwards.

143
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:48,221
And he's like, oh great, OK, great.

144
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:50,581
And then I come back the
next day and it's completely different.

145
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:53,361
Exactly the way I wanted and it's
perfect and it's like, oh, that's great.

146
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,040
[Schafer vocalizing sound effects]

147
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,369
Schafer: That's awesome.

148
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,090
Schafer: You know, it's like,
finding someone like that is really,

149
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,990
it's hard to find people like that
and so you kind of hang onto them.

150
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,563
Of course, he's supposed
to go back to school.

151
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,680
So then you have to figure out whether
you want to derail someone's education

152
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,560
by trying to recruit them to
come to your company.

153
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,882
Which of course, I have no problem with.

154
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:34,682
I'm already done thinking about it
and I've already thought about it

155
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:38,322
while I was saying that sentence,
so, so much for his education.

156
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,980
[Laughter]

157
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,155
Rice: We're finally like fully staffed
and we've got like our team,

158
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,867
all of our budget's totally spent
on everyone who's on the team.

159
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:52,267
So I think that, you know, a month or
so from now it's going to feel like

160
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,860
everything's just kind of moving
forward steadily and the game is being made.

161
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,120
Rice: At the time when we
started the Maiden Feast,

162
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,455
that was kind of the only puzzle
that was far enough along

163
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,605
that we had enough of a design to
actually start building stuff.

164
00:10:15,605 --> 00:10:19,139
So we did know going in that it was
like a super kind of meaty puzzle

165
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,460
that was going to be a
tough one to implement.

166
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,060
And we still, you know, it was kind of
all we had to go on at the point.

167
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,260
Schafer: I had the Maiden's Feast
designed so they had to like, oh,

168
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,868
we got to pick that, 'cause that's the
only thing that's really designed.

169
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:33,907
Rice: But by the time we'd gotten it
to like the first pass kind of state,

170
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:35,802
then we had designs for
this Cloud Colony stuff,

171
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,862
which we knew was just
a lot easier to implement

172
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:41,282
and a lot more indicative
of the rest of the game.

173
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,020
Schafer: So navigation across different
layers and pointing and clicking,

174
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,120
talking to people, camera motion
is all part of Cloud Colony.

175
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,030
Rice: One of the nice things about being
able to make those kinds of decisions

176
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,770
and jump around is we can like
really look at in the moment

177
00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:00,040
what is most important for the game
and be able to kind of like change tracks,

178
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,160
without having to like clear that
decision with a publisher.

179
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,605
Schafer: So we kind of left Maiden Feast
where it was, which is, you know,

180
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:12,405
has like a stand-in, a couple
stand-in pieces of art in there.

181
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,706
Much as it pains me to leave that
unfinished, but we'll revisit it soon, I think.

182
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:22,766
Schafer: This is a kick-off meeting
for the Cloud Colony.

183
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,280
Required reading for this meeting is
this document everyone' read, I'm sure.

184
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,719
I've already started working on it.

185
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,001
So I think it's just good to
go over all the puzzles

186
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:36,241
in case it exposes things we haven't
thought of or just questions you guys have.

187
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,140
Are you ready? Ready to begin?

188
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,820
Schafer: This is the part of the game right
after the Maiden's Feast when you get,

189
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,440
when you break away and you hitch a
ride on that buzzard, on the corset.

190
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,540
And you fly.

191
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,242
It takes you up into the air.

192
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:55,562
She's the sacrifice girl who's just chosen to
run away instead of being sacrificed

193
00:11:55,562 --> 00:11:57,075
and feels that she may
have just endangered,

194
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,695
she's been told that this will
endanger her entire town

195
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,441
if the monster's not appeased.

196
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,494
So now the monster's all upset and
she's feeling like I have to do something

197
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,018
to get rid of this monster and to
protect my family and my town.

198
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,458
But before I get back there I'm going
to have to like figure out a plan.

199
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:19,288
So she arrives in the home world,
if you will, of the bird,

200
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:24,689
which is a little village made of
primarily nests that have been,

201
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:28,349
that are buoyant on these really thick
clouds, that we're calling the Cloud Colony.

202
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:34,600
[Music]

203
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,107
Schafer: I feel much better because
I actually, like I felt good

204
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:41,867
after I wrote that cloud document,
but that was really only like four puzzles.

205
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:44,667
And the spaceship one has like
sixteen puzzles in there or something.

206
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:45,907
So I'm catching up now.

207
00:12:45,960 --> 00:13:00,560
[Music]

208
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,880
Schafer: Aha! Work. I did work.

209
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,240
This is the spec for
the whole spaceship.

210
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,660
Designed all the puzzles
for the spaceship.

211
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,140
Offscreen Voice:
Really? All the puzzles?

212
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,000
Schafer: Yeah, all the
puzzles for the spaceship.

213
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,980
And this is just two-thirds of
the puzzles for the girl's world.

214
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,580
But there's still, I mean, there's
still a lot of stuff to design.

215
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,500
Schafer: But it's like I have
plot points, you know.

216
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,407
I have things where I know
I want that to end, Act One.

217
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:40,141
And then that ends Act Two.

218
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:42,250
And then I have these
plot points that happen.

219
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,722
And then to get to that plot
point you have to create

220
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,830
obstacles and puzzles at the same time,
which come out of the story.

221
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,510
Break out of routine.

222
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,160
Spaceship boy has this routine that
he's stuck in every day in space

223
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,304
and he has to break out of it.

224
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:58,304
That's the first puzzle.

225
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,269
You do work backwards.

226
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:02,803
Like you know, it's like you actually
aren't designing puzzles.

227
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:05,243
You're designing the
obstacles in a lot of ways.

228
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:09,587
Like you say, you had a situation in
the game where character,

229
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:13,101
you just know there's a plot point where
they have to shoot the President.

230
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,162
And so, I don't have any plans
to shoot the President.

231
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:18,422
So, but anyways, say that
was a puzzle in the game.

232
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:19,961
The President's really bad.

233
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,238
You got to shoot the President.

234
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,564
You know, I work backwards,
so some cool wish fulfillment,

235
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:26,673
like OK, he's going to be, he's
sneaking into the White House.

236
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,823
How would you sneak into White House?

237
00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:30,813
You could wear a mask that made
you look like a visiting ambassador.

238
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,483
Like how do you make a plaster cast
of his face to make the mask?

239
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:36,343
Then maybe it's to trick him into
tripping and falling in cement.

240
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:39,102
And then at each point you think, OK,
was that an actual revelation?

241
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:43,562
Like you don't want to have, it just be
a series of tedious chores.

242
00:14:43,562 --> 00:14:47,663
It's got to be like oh, I have a really
clear problem that I need to solve.

243
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:52,023
Like the three most obvious
ways to solve it don't work.

244
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,308
And the game anticipates that and
like has a great response

245
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:57,061
for when you try to
execute that solution.

246
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:58,912
You put a little like, aha!

247
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,745
Good try, no.

248
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:02,565
But did you think about this?

249
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:05,599
And that little nudge is like,
oh, you know, kind of,

250
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,211
like doesn't give you the answer

251
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,900
but kind of points you back towards
the ballpark where the answer is.

252
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,681
Schafer: This is the first puzzle.

253
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:16,401
So the puzzle is that you
open this a little bit.

254
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,176
And then you try to go to it, it closes.

255
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:23,289
And then there's some
really counterintuitive,

256
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:28,269
almost opposite of normal way of
thinking that makes you realize, ah!

257
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,714
If I did this really weird thing,
that would actually work.

258
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,960
The thing you had to do with
the lock is take the lock

259
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,140
and actually lock the gate shut.

260
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,380
So now when you try to pull the chain,
it can't pull the gate up and instead...

261
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,546
'Cause then the player's like,
oh, I'm so smart, you know.

262
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:03,566
I figured it out.

263
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,500
Now that a lot of stuff is
designed ahead of those guys

264
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,400
and they're able to look
at it and work on it.

265
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,267
That always relieves a
little bit of tension.

266
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,660
Rice: Tim has filled in,
it looks like boy world

267
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,524
and I think he's even put
more girl world stuff in.

268
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,104
Have you even looked
at this, really, Levi?

269
00:16:24,104 --> 00:16:25,552
Ryken: This is all Tim does?

270
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,788
I thought he was supposed
to be writing things,

271
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:28,586
not just writing little
things on Post-its.

272
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:29,926
Rice: Yeah, he's writing the
whole game on little Post-its.

273
00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:30,926
Ryken: Oh, OK.

274
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,100
Rice: There wasn't much there before,
so it's nice to see that it's filled out.

275
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,020
Rice: It's definitely unique
and different than

276
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,908
anything he's designed
or written before.

277
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,860
So I think it's cool to see that
he's trying something different

278
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,260
and kind of going out
on a limb a little bit.

279
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,685
I haven't seen any writing yet,
so I don't know what that's going to be like.

280
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:50,388
Because it does seem like this
game has a much more serious tone

281
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:52,121
than his other games have,

282
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,844
but I'm excited to get to that point
where I start seeing Tim's writing,

283
00:16:54,844 --> 00:16:56,464
because I'm sure it'll be awesome.

284
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,420
Rice: So far this is in the game.

285
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,060
This is all in the game.

286
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,919
It looks like this.

287
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,460
This is all in the game.

288
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,800
And now we're going to be
starting on some of this stuff.

289
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,719
Rice: And we have an approved
girl, so that's exciting.

290
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,284
Petty: So let's see.

291
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,439
So let's look at the
suicide girl. So she's got...

292
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,922
Schafer: See, you call
her suicide girl, too.

293
00:17:17,922 --> 00:17:19,462
Petty: Yeah.
Schafer: It's sacrifice girl.

294
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:20,402
Petty: I know it is.

295
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,120
So which of these dresses
do you like the most?

296
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,113
Schafer: My favorite one is that one,
but I like the original one.

297
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,707
I like that one, too.

298
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:34,087
Schafer: So I just put them in front of
my daughter and let her pick.

299
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,860
That solved the whole problem.

300
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,862
Schafer: These are the princesses

301
00:17:37,862 --> 00:17:39,202
from papa's new game.

302
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:40,202
Schafer: I call them princesses.

303
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:41,322
Which one do you like best?

304
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,800
Think really hard.

305
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,620
Why do you like em?

306
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,060
Daughter: Because she's so beautiful.

307
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,751
Rice: And she's looking good.

308
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,720
We just got her in the game.

309
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,820
She's walking around and everything.

310
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,441
The boy's getting there.

311
00:18:03,441 --> 00:18:05,261
We've done like two rounds on him.

312
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,660
Schafer: Scott's been working
on characters in the morning.

313
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,550
He's been kind of splitting his time with
a book that he's working on,

314
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,024
an art show or one of the
zillion things that he does.

315
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:15,410
He's very busy.

316
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,527
Campbell: So it's an ongoing kind of,

317
00:18:17,527 --> 00:18:22,431
kind of project and this
is the culmination of it.

318
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,496
Culmination of like a year, you know,
like a year and a half's worth right now.

319
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,060
And then we have a book coming out,
so that's what we're doing, so.

320
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,243
Schafer: He's drawn some of the
sacrifice girl and spaceship boy.

321
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:35,658
He's been drawing some of
the Cloud Colony people.

322
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,254
And I'm supposed to
look at those, right.

323
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,760
I've got to give him feedback on those.

324
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,036
Schafer: I do like that guy, too.

325
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,940
But then again he is doing a cool pose.

326
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,843
Campbell: And it's going great, man.

327
00:18:44,843 --> 00:18:45,947
It's looking really good.

328
00:18:45,947 --> 00:18:50,340
I definitely feel that like relaxation
of like knowing that like these designs,

329
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,547
even if they're a little unfinished,

330
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,954
I know they're going to go to Bagel

331
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,280
and he's going to make them like,
fucking make 'em Bagel-style.

332
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,860
Dude, I just swore again.

333
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,080
I mean, I thought for sure I wasn't
going to swear in these things.

334
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,888
I'm mellowing out, dude.

335
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:04,125
But yeah, he's doing great.

336
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,745
He has a lot of work
ahead of him, though.

337
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,418
He's stressed about it,
but Bagel's the kind of guy,

338
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,280
he's like just this kind
of chill dude, you know.

339
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,868
He's like, I know.

340
00:19:10,868 --> 00:19:12,321
He's like, I'm going to, he's like,

341
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:14,676
I'm going to have a lot of
work ahead of me, but ah.

342
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,642
'Cause it's like it's all fun stuff, you know,
he's doing what he loves,

343
00:19:17,642 --> 00:19:19,316
which is like painting
that stuff, you know.

344
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,128
And he's definitely, he's
definitely feeling kind of nervous,

345
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:27,408
but I'm so excited for it to
be his, his look, so yeah.

346
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,617
Offscreen Voice: So Bagel's in the
studio this week? Rice: Yeah.

347
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,860
Bagel's in my house this week.
Offscreen Voice: Perfect.

348
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,108
Rice: He had to take
Marius's spot from the couch.

349
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:50,728
So Marius got kicked out.

350
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,460
I'm like running a hostel right now.

351
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,080
Stapley: Yeah, it's weird.

352
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,860
There's a lot of farting going on.

353
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,980
He has these weird nerdy
glasses that he wears at night.

354
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,200
Schafer: Why is Bagel in
the office this week?

355
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,420
I don't know.

356
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,640
Hi guys.

357
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,900
Schafer: Hi, oh my god you look so real.

358
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,360
Lee: He's come out of the camera!

359
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,140
Schafer: The microphone is
working so well today.

360
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,800
Bagel: My microphone is awesome!

361
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,520
Crook: Now we can't turn you down.

362
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,144
Schafer: Lee was starting some
new processes with art production,

363
00:20:21,144 --> 00:20:24,785
like trying to get Bagel to
be pretty independent

364
00:20:24,785 --> 00:20:27,844
where he could just paint actual art for
the game right into the engines.

365
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:32,085
So getting that set up was really hard
to do over Skype or Google Hang Outs,

366
00:20:32,085 --> 00:20:33,386
like we do.

367
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,151
We don't always have the smoothest
conversations over that,

368
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,280
I don't know if you noticed.

369
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,660
Stapley: [inaudible]

370
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,192
Petty: I think we're going
to do it tomorrow.

371
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,660
Stapley: [inaudible]

372
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,358
Petty: What's that?

373
00:20:45,462 --> 00:20:46,922
Stapley: [inaudible]

374
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,900
Petty: I'm sorry,
I can't make it out, dude.

375
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,720
Stapley: [inaudible]

376
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,180
[Laughing]

377
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,724
Stapley: But it is good to kind of
sit right with them, you know.

378
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,383
Crook: Yeah, I think this
texture, the painting style

379
00:21:01,383 --> 00:21:06,243
goes really well with this sort of weird...
Stapley: Brush stroke.

380
00:21:06,243 --> 00:21:07,274
Crook: the way we're animating it.

381
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,660
I think it goes really well with it.

382
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,133
I think it's cool.

383
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,808
Stapley: But yeah, there are some things
that are easier just to talk to,

384
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:15,142
like walk over to Lee and
talk to him, I think.

385
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:18,393
I've already done that like three
times today, which is pretty nice.

386
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,260
Rice: And here like with
such a small art team,

387
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,313
like it's going to be really important
that he's not only painting stuff

388
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,651
but like making sure it gets
into the game right

389
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,240
and looks good and he's viewing it in
the game and seeing how that changes.

390
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,120
Petty: So like Brandon
spent a lot of time

391
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,700
making sure that all the
tools he was writing

392
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,320
were going to help Bagel and make
sure that that was a really smooth process.

393
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,780
Brandon: The main thing that I've been
working is enhancements to our scene editor

394
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,610
so that the tool works a little
bit more like Photoshop

395
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,603
in terms of being able to hide and show
the layers that you're working on.

396
00:21:49,603 --> 00:21:52,261
I got the Nav meshes in
there so that instead of

397
00:21:52,261 --> 00:21:54,622
just editing these in text
files you can actually,

398
00:21:54,622 --> 00:21:59,422
you know, individually kind of lay out the
geometry for the walkable areas.

399
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,883
Just really trying to flesh the stuff out so
that the workflow for artists is a lot smoother.

400
00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:07,304
Rice: And it's almost there
so I think that's the,

401
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:10,064
that's the idea, is to try to get him
comfortable with that process.

402
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,980
Stapley: Yeah, so you can see...

403
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:19,824
Right. Right, right.

404
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,660
Still totally getting used to this shit.

405
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:49,980
[Music]

406
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,350
Stapley: Hey, bros. What's up?

407
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,050
How's it going, fellows?

408
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,840
Offscreen Voice: So, has
this been coming along?

409
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,482
Stapley: Oh, it's almost done,
it's almost done.

410
00:22:58,667 --> 00:22:59,827
No, I'm just kidding.

411
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,538
It's not done at all.

412
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,700
I'm going to give up on it
and come back to it later.

413
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,488
And there's a bunch of other shit to do

414
00:23:06,488 --> 00:23:11,188
and I like don't have any fresh
eyes on it anymore, you know.

415
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,860
I've just been looking at the same thing
for like a week and I'm over it.

416
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,140
I'm going to just work on it until stand-ups
and then Tim's going to check it out.

417
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,380
Petty: In terms of like
how good the readability is.

418
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,722
If it's feeling right to you, you know,
story, theme-wise and all that,

419
00:23:25,722 --> 00:23:28,278
before he digs into
some of the other areas.

420
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,404
And then you know, like there's a lot of,
like because that Cloud Colony...

421
00:23:31,404 --> 00:23:32,918
Schafer: I can see how the
world's going to look pretty

422
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,660
and how it's going to all look
like it's one cohesive thing,

423
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:40,588
but the secret thing that I'm hoping for is still,
we have some of the,

424
00:23:40,588 --> 00:23:44,688
Bagel's ideas that only he would
come up with for the landscape.

425
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,620
Kind of bizarre.

426
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,700
He doesn't have those in there yet.

427
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,860
Stapley: Yeah, this was Peter's,
Peter's concept ideas.

428
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,105
Lee's layout.

429
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,341
Would I do a painting of this?

430
00:23:57,341 --> 00:23:58,201
I'm not sure.

431
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,260
I don't know if I would.

432
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,740
But like I'm doing a painting of it now.

433
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,880
OK, man.

434
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,918
I'm wondering about
that Bagel filter thing.

435
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,140
I'm just wondering what it is, you know.

436
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,260
What if Tim's happy with it.

437
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,280
I should talk to Tim.

438
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,520
Schafer: I have not
talked to him about that.

439
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,000
I haven't talked to him on this trip
about how he's feeling about everything.

440
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,440
That'll be interesting.

441
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,438
Hopefully we get some alone time.

442
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,780
Petty: I just don't know
about the painting Bagel.

443
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,600
Now how are you
feeling about the like...

444
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,980
We've been going back
and forth a long time

445
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,300
just trying to get a feel
for that whole process.

446
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,137
Stapley: The paining process?
Petty: Yeah.

447
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,904
And then like work on this big
ass fucking layered files and...

448
00:24:37,904 --> 00:24:40,029
Stapley: Yeah, yeah.
I'm comfortable with that.

449
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:43,840
I'd like to actually get involved more
with like the concept stuff, though.

450
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,420
Petty: Yeah?

451
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,842
Stapley: I feel like I'm
just kind of a painter.

452
00:24:46,842 --> 00:24:50,608
I just feel like people are expecting
it to be mine somehow,

453
00:24:50,608 --> 00:24:52,988
you know, just 'cause, you know.

454
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,820
That's what people are saying.

455
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,659
And like it's supposed to be
my style but it isn't really.

456
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,840
Petty: It may be that you're feeling
like the painting isn't the side

457
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,790
that you care about most.

458
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,587
Maybe you feel more about the shape,
language and the concept design

459
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:07,167
and we, you know, Levi does
painting and you do layouts.

460
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:09,467
There's flexibility there.

461
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,522
Stapley: Where like
I don't paint everything

462
00:25:11,522 --> 00:25:14,502
but be kind of like overlook, you know.

463
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,820
Kind of just try to keep
everything together.

464
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,180
And that way I'm able to
do some more idea stuff.

465
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,844
'Cause even now the way it's going,
like I don't think, I mean,

466
00:25:25,844 --> 00:25:26,739
like even this way

467
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,211
I don't think I'd be able to do all
these paintings in four months.

468
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,580
Seventy paintings by myself,
anyway, you know.

469
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,321
Well, at least if we're going to say
like this is Bagel's style game,

470
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:43,592
then I would, yeah, at least I would
have a little bit more like yeah,

471
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,579
you know, that is my stuff. You know.

472
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,520
Instead of like, ah, it's like an
awesome Peter Chan drawing

473
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,860
or something, you know, that I colored.

474
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,178
Why don't we like finish off this sprint
until the end of the month, right.

475
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,665
I'll try to get all this
cloud things going.

476
00:26:00,665 --> 00:26:03,016
Petty: But I think it's a
tougher thing where that

477
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,776
if we come up with a sketch of a plan
that we think might work,

478
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,782
then I think we should try it sooner
than later, 'cause fuck a sprint.

479
00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:10,066
Who cares? I don't care.

480
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:11,666
There's no publisher fucking
us in the ass over it.

481
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:14,734
Like with just the whole point is,
it's just there to like be milestones

482
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,029
as we make this game, right?

483
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:21,132
So if we, you know, as long we're meeting
Tim's goals for the project,

484
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,404
as long as we think we
can actually get it done

485
00:26:23,404 --> 00:26:25,724
and as long as we're all
willing to give it a shot,

486
00:26:25,724 --> 00:26:29,104
there's no reason in the world
we shouldn't be flexible. Right.

487
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,596
Stapley: I think it was because
really when it first started,

488
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,960
it was going to be like $300,000

489
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,680
and we're going to just try to do some
retro Day of the Tentacle shit, you know.

490
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,080
And I know things change so much from

491
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,020
the beginning of this
Kickstarter thing, you know.

492
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,187
And I know now it's huge,
it's a big thing, which is great.

493
00:26:49,187 --> 00:26:50,785
And it's awesome.

494
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,260
But, I think we can work it out somehow.

495
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,160
Schafer: You know, right now Bagel's
been doing a lot of painting,

496
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,244
which is not necessarily, I can see
where that would feel like,

497
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:05,079
you're just like doing a coloring
book or paint-by-numbers.

498
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,780
Those are just my terms, not his.

499
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,837
Stapley: I don't know.

500
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,940
I don't even know how
it's going to turn out.

501
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,740
It might turn out totally different.

502
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,960
I'm just kind of glad I got it
off my chest, that's all.

503
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,556
Schafer: Yeah, I think his
coming out here in person

504
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,820
is what allowed him to
open up about that.

505
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,832
I think he's over Skype.

506
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,220
It's hard to really talk about,
how you're feeling.

507
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,420
Stapley: I'm glad I said it, because
I was all worried about it.

508
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,308
So I think so.

509
00:27:34,308 --> 00:27:36,868
I think we're going to
try to start doing that.

510
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,924
Schafer: Like I'll feel a lot better
once we made one of something.

511
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:43,996
Like once, 'cause I was feeling like
we had not yet accomplished,

512
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,552
the game was looking good
and coming along, right.

513
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,609
But we'd not yet accomplished that
thing of seeing something

514
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:53,911
in the playable version of the game
that had that crazy Bagel-style yet.

515
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,200
Like the special element of like
surrealism or just kind of

516
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,840
dream logic that his
paintings might have.

517
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,940
I hadn't yet seen in the game yet.

518
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,581
So once we have something like that
in the game, I'll be like, OK, great.

519
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,900
We just need to do that a whole bunch
of times then I'll feel a lot more relaxed.

520
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,400
But until you achieve that, there's
always this question of like

521
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,180
will you be able to achieve
what you want to do.

522
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,140
You know, it's tricky,
'cause you got to make,

523
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,039
get the game to look the
way you want it to look,

524
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,379
but also get done on time
with the people that you have

525
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,480
and also all those
people have to be happy.

526
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,380
Yeah, like you're
trying to get people to

527
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,478
contribute their whole
selfs to the project.

528
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,020
So that's challenging.

529
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,600
But it's what I spent the
most of my time recently,

530
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,306
like the last ten years recently, like doing,
like trying to solve that problem.

531
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,127
How to make a group of
people work well together

532
00:28:39,127 --> 00:28:44,771
and bring the best ideas forth and
make good stuff together.

533
