1
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,336
Schafer: Oh, Brad is out. Okay.

2
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,371
Hello everybody.

3
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,405
Hi. It's good to see you.

4
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,706
Hello. Thank you for coming.

5
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,609
So, uh, it's Monday,

6
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,444
and Friday was terrible.

7
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:45,812
Uh, all of you were here.

8
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:46,680
I want to just think everyone

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,616
for, uh, showing so much class

10
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:50,817
going through
that difficult day.

11
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,686
You guys all, um, uh,

12
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,454
held together nicely.

13
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,989
It was a rough day
on everybody

14
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,525
and, um, I think you showed
a lot of compassion

15
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,094
for the people who are leaving
and also understanding

16
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,196
for those of us
who had to make that decision,

17
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,265
and it really helped us
get through it.

18
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:09,002
And we will--we are getting through it, and it's, um...

19
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,539
Now we have a bunch of games
we gotta make and stuff to do.

20
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,709
Um, we are still
helping the people

21
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,844
who need letters of reference,

22
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,846
letters of recommendation,
stuff like that.

23
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,882
Help--doing what we can
to get them set up

24
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,450
with new engagements.

25
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,852
Um, but other than that,

26
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,522
we here are still
working on these games.

27
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,694
Did you want to talk
about the layoffs?

28
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,529
-Is that part of the documentary?

29
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,298
Talk about the layoffs.
I'm gonna have a drink.

30
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,100
Can I drink on camera?

31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,536
If the kids are watchin' this,
kids, don't drink.

32
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,838
A week ago,
we had a project canceled,

33
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,540
an unannounced project
from a publisher

34
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,874
that really liked the game.

35
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,676
We had just done
our vertical slice

36
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,278
and then gave us
great feedback on it

37
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,046
and they said it was great
and they really liked it.

38
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,816
And then the next call
was they're canceling it

39
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,352
for higher-up reasons.

40
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,419
Well, that was a big project

41
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,988
that was funding
a lot of people.

42
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,790
And--and then another
one of our publishers

43
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,326
from another project is
having financial problems

44
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,161
and can't pay us.

45
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,498
Bailey: You know, it's public news
now that Majesco is, um...

46
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,734
Pardon me.

47
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,735
Not timed there.

48
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,870
Majesco has made

49
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,805
a public statement that

50
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,742
their, you know,
continued ability to perform

51
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,444
as--as a going concern is
at stake and, of course,

52
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,146
we did Costume Quest 2 with them

53
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,715
and the payments were 
not complete for that.

54
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,884
So we're actually--
we're owed money

55
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,719
by Majesco that
we're not getting paid.

56
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,322
And then, of course
Costume Quest 2, um,

57
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,990
because of that statement,
you can infer

58
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,192
that it's not being
marketed properly

59
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,795
and it's not being 
distributed to its fullest extent

60
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,798
that you would expect from
a publisher, because there--

61
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,767
you know, the means and
the people there to do that

62
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,368
just don't exist anymore.

63
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,736
Um, so it's kind of
a perfect storm.

64
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:53,206
It was a bad week
to put it mildly.

65
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,308
So, glad that week's over.

66
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,144
If that publisher
hadn't canceled it,

67
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,645
you know,
things would have been--

68
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,714
were looking really good
for the studio.

69
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,215
Um, I think things are still

70
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,817
looking really good
for the studio,

71
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,720
but only because
we took quick action.

72
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,256
Schafer: So we had to let go
of 12 people.

73
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:13,860
Some of them, uh, had been here
for a short period of time

74
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,629
and some of them had been
here for a long period of time,

75
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:16,863
over ten years.

76
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,133
So that was really hard.

77
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,069
Stoddard: What do you want to know,
how I feel about them and--

78
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,703
Off camera: Yeah, yeah, how was it?
I mean you--

79
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,238
Stoddard: It was horrible.
-Yeah.

80
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,241
It was really horrible. Um...

81
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,377
I mean, I understand
why it happened,

82
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:34,514
but, like, we--the audio team
was super tight, uh,

83
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,416
and now there's two of us instead of four.

84
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,318
Um, it was a heavy hit.

85
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,855
The day of the layoffs
were just brutal.

86
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,424
Kipnis: Uh, well, I will say
that the layoffs--

87
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,494
I wasn't actually at the
office when it happened, so...

88
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:50,831
And, um, at first,
like, I--I got--

89
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:52,632
I got text messages about it

90
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:56,103
and it was, uh...

91
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:59,806
it was really tough
to--to hear about it, um,

92
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,342
and it--it was tough to, like,
not be here to say goodbye

93
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,077
to some of those people

94
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,779
that I've worked with
for years and years

95
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:10,884
and, like, you know,
I'm gonna miss a lot.

96
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:13,854
I don't know what else to say.

97
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,755
Crook: And you always feel a little
bit guilty when you're still here,

98
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:20,192
you know,
and other people aren't,

99
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:25,165
um, and it hurts morale
quite a bit, um,

100
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:28,235
but...

101
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,304
but I know that it--I know
that it was not taken lightly.

102
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,007
Hansen: It was the hardest
day of my life.

103
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,009
I never thought we would be
in that situation,

104
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:40,580
but project cancelations
happen and, you know,

105
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,749
sometimes you can absorb it
and sometimes you can't.

106
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,985
So Tim and I almost
avoided each other

107
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:49,489
just 'cause we knew that we had
to meet and talk about that.

108
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,259
And I didn't want to,
and he didn't want to either.

109
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,827
There was no, like,
oh, yeah, it's so easy,

110
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,495
it's person X, Y, and Z.

111
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,098
It's like every single one
of those people are--

112
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:01,001
they're huge contributors
to all these games we've made.

113
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,770
They're the people we hang
out with after work and so--

114
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,206
And, you know, and it's tough
for Double Fine in general,

115
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,041
because historically, I mean,

116
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,343
we even said this
in the media in the past,

117
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,345
we don't do layoffs
and that sort of thing.

118
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:16,016
It was--it was
a tough decision for sure.

119
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,018
Russell: A lot of us just stayed
afterwards in the room,

120
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,053
after we were told,
and just talked about

121
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,088
the history of the company,
and just, we were like,

122
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,823
we couldn't believe
this happened to us,

123
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,293
but you know,
in the game industry

124
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,794
and in any entertainment industry,

125
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,030
it's--it's the norm.

126
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,034
We're the exception,
so in that respect I--

127
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,536
I--I feel lucky,

128
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:40,440
and we'll survive, a little bit
smaller, a little leaner,

129
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,775
but we'll make it.

130
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:52,020
[Music]

131
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:56,990
Schafer: So basically we are
powering forward on our, um,

132
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,826
uh, remaining titles
that we're working on.

133
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:00,994
Those are the stories
I really wanted

134
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,095
to make the documentary about

135
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,496
but we could never
do that, like,

136
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,831
those publisher games,

137
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,533
to see, like, what it's like,

138
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,235
all those meetings where
they're saying,

139
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,503
"This game is so great,
we can't wait to see it."

140
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,806
And then the meeting where they
actually said it's canceled,

141
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,275
we have to cancel it,
but I hope you still make it

142
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,676
'cause I really want to play it.

143
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,711
That was an actual quote
from the guy,

144
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,512
he was like,
"If you make it

145
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,814
I really want to play it."

146
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,082
It's like, "Oh, thanks,
that makes up

147
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,718
for me laying off 12 people.

148
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,852
That--I totally feel good now

149
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,554
that you want to play this game

150
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,457
that you just killed."

151
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:35,528
But, um, since I'm mostly fueled
by angriness and bitterness,

152
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:39,699
then I'm stronger than ever right now.

153
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,704
You know, whatever works.

[Chatter]

00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,768
Schafer: Oh god, is that thing still here?
Mitchell: It's way funnier now.

157
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,869
Muir: It was just sad.
Mitchell: Yeah.

158
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,304
Muir: It wasn't bad.
Mitchell: No.

159
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,205
Schafer: That one that you
found under the sink?

160
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,774
Muir: It's really good.
It's like, uh...

161
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,808
Mitchell: It's gooey, though.

162
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,310
Muir: Chipotle.

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,644

165
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,315
Hello, everybody! Hello.

166
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,649
And thank you for coming back

167
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:30,984
to work here again
for another year.

168

It's awesome to see you
all here.

Welcome back.

00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,755
Nice to see you all.

00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:36,856
Rice: Yeah, man.

172
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,191
2015.

173
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,026
Schafer: 2015. Wait a second.

00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,562
Does that mean
we didn't finish in December?

175
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,797
Rice: Yeah.

176
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,732
Comin' on three years.

177
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:48,001
Schafer: Three--no kidding?
It's like Rip Van Winkle.

178
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,736
All I remember is
the Kickstarter,

179
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:53,073
and then I woke up
and it's three years later.

180
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,808
Crook: And we all have big, long--and
we all have big, long beards.

181
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,643
Schafer: Yeah, we're just here
with beards.

182
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,145
Ray, where did all that money go, what?

183
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,081
I guess we should
ship this game.

184
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,316
But the game was awesome.

185
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,218
Um, but, um, but we--

186
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:09,389
I think I'm trying to this week
still keep play testing,

187
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,524
especially the problem areas
in the game

188
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,493
where people get
hung up the most

189
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,362
and catch any
remaining dialogue.

190
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,664
There's probably some object
interactions or examine lines

191
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,532
that are still missing
that I would love to catch.

192
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:22,335
Please keep talking
and don't be freaked out

193
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,837
that we're not answering you,
'cause we'd just like

194
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,105
to hear what you're thinking.

195
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,840
Miller: All right.

196
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,675
I'm already baffled.

197
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,877
Vella: Is this one?

198
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,645
Miller: This must be
incredibly fun to watch.

199
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:35,481
Schafer: We're not even here.

200
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:36,850
Miller: What's that?
You're not paying attention?

201
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,284
Schafer: Yeah, I'm doing my taxes
over here.

202
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,120
Miller: I think I'll switch to Shay

203
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,857
'cause I can't figure this out.

204
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,625
Schafer: I mean, it's--it--that--
the first puzzle,

205
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,794
it's, like, one of the first
puzzles that Vella has,

206
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:51,131
and you have to do something
and get this visual feedback,

207
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,333
and you have to mess with it
a lot and get some more feedback

208
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,835
to kind of figure out
the patterns.

209
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,637
Um, and then it's
just a problem of, like,

210
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,540
have we kind of inceptioned?
Is that a verb?

211
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,741
Put the idea in
the player's head

212
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,710
of what they want to do enough.

213
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,111
'Cause sometimes
you just mess with the game

214
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,312
and you just kind of bang on it

215
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,881
and you--woo, you solved it,

216
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,149
you don't really know
how you solved it.

217
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,984
And that to me is almost
a worst-case scenario.

218
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,319
That's almost worse than
getting stuck forever, you know?

219
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,021
Like, getting--
'cause being stuck forever,

220
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,322
if you finally solve it
you feel great.

221
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,791
But if you solve it in accident, you're like,

222
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,325
I don't know what just happened, you move on

223
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,828
and you kind of get
this kind of bored feeling.

224
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,029
And it's really easy to just

225
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,031
accidently put
this one line in

226
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,001
that makes everybody just
know what to do immediately.

227
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:31,404
So it's--it's like a lot of--
'cause time--time is short

228
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,273
and we don't have much--
we don't have much time left,

229
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,041
and to solve these problems,

230
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,443
to make sure that everyone
gets through the game,

231
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,178
it's really tempting
to just kind of, like,

232
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,712
short circuit all the puzzles and make sure

233
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,714
that everybody
can get through them.

234
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,383
But you have to kind of
take a lot of time

235
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,719
to actually really look,
um, carefully at, like,

236
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,255
each mental leap
the player is making.

237
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,191
[Off camera] If people were saying
the first one was too easy

238
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:54,027
and you're taking out
a lot of the hints,

239
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,995
I mean, are you afraid you went
too far in the other direction?

240
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,197
-It seems like there's a lot--
Schafer: Well, I'm hoping--

241
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,731
I'm hoping we went way too far.

242
00:09:58,731 --> 00:09:59,999
Rice: But yeah, like Tim said,
in general I think

243
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,434
we're gonna keep play testing

244
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,002
in hopes that

245
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,004
anything that we find
that is a problem

246
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,873
down the road
could be changed.

247
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:10,777
Crook: Are we gonna have--
with--with Ben leaving,

248
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,012
are we having any other--
another GP coming on

249
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,248
or are we gonna be able
to just absorb?

250
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:19,285
Peck: Um, well, it's my second to
last day here at Double Fine.

251
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,689
And, uh, just trying to, like,
put a bow on as many things

252
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,458
as I could
before leaving.

253
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,293
The place I'm going to
is quite a bit--

254
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,264
it's like a larger company so...

255
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,466
I'm--yeah,
I'm gonna miss the...

256
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:37,103
like, the small little scenes
at the lunch table

257
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,706
or, like, company meetings
and stuff like that

258
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,575
where, like, it's okay
to make a dick joke

259
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:46,746
or, like, it's okay to...

260
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,015
to just kind of be yourself
a bit.

261
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,584
Um...

262
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,721
I'm hoping I can kind of take
a little bit of that for--

263
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:58,324
like, with me wherever
I go, you know?

264
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,527
I feel bad I'm not gonna
be there for, like,

265
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,996
when the shit inevitably
hits the fan, you know,

266
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,098
and the game needs
to be finaled.

267
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,199
Kipnis: That jerk.

268
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,802
No, I mean, it sucks.

269
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,805
It sucks. I mean, Ben--Ben contributed a lot

270
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,675
to the--to the game
and, you know, we're--

271
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,645
we're having to kind of
figure out some stuff in the code

272
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,781
that he wrote when he could
have been here to help us out.

273
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,218
I mean, it sucks, but, um,

274
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,754
we'll just have to finish
without him, you know?

275
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:31,824
Crook: I mean, I will say, you know,
we've had to transition

276
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:35,595
because, um, Lee left
the project

277
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,464
and, um, that was--
that was scary, um,

278
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,400
because he--he seemed to know

279
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,035
what was going on
with everything.

280
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,003
And so I think Anna's
had to take on a lot

281
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:47,440
of some of the responsibilities
that Lee had, um,

282
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,841
as far as puzzle chains

283
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,244
and--and how those are
all put together

284
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,379
and--and the logic.

285
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,316
Um, so I'm sure that's
been stressful for her.

286
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,852
[Offscreen] Do you regret not getting to
see Broken Age through to the end?

287
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,087
Petty: Yeah, you know,
I'm trying to think.

288
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,255
I think this is the only time

289
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,224
I haven't stayed on a project

290
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,558
all the way through.

291
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,826
It was a lot of those, um,

292
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,128
small decisions
right at the end of the project

293
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,563
that have a big impact
on the game

294
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,698
'cause all the content's there

295
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:12,832
and it's all connected.

296
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:13,866
And sometimes just

297
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,401
pushing and pulling a few things

298
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,403
can--it, um, can
really help the game,

299
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,671
and it's nice to be
part of that.

300
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,440
But, uh, I don't think

301
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,843
I'll be part of that
for Act 2 anyways, but--

302
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,679
I think I'm--I'm excited
for Act 2 to come out,

303
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,350
because I think Act 1 had
a lot of great things about it

304
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,652
but it was incomplete,
and, you know,

305
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,721
you can sort of see the whole arc
or play the whole game,

306
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,156
might get a better sense
of whether

307
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,825
that was successful or not.

308
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:42,161
But hopefully I've helped
set that up, um,

309
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,531
to be a--to be
a great experience.

310
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,866
Schafer: But we don't need anybody.

311
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,868
Broken Age team.

312
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,703
We don't--
we don't need nobody.

313
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,272
We'll finish it ourselves.

314
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,306
So where are we supposed to be right now,

315
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,841
Alpha on the finale?

316
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,509
Rice: Yeah. You wanna look at the...

317
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,312
Schafer: When is beta on B2 and G2?
Is that there?

318
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,781
Rice: Yeah, so we'll show you
the timeline as it is right now.

319
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,283
Um, but Matt and Vic and I,
and Malena

320
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,719
are gonna meet
this afternoon now, uh,

321
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,121
and want to get
a lot more clarity

322
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,423
into just closing out
the project,

323
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,725
but also, like,
these beta sprints

324
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,160
and--and things like that
as well.

325
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,795
Hansen: Right now there's a tendency

326
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,764
for people to gravitate towards
whatever is the, you know,

327
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,732
maybe the most interesting work,
and that's not--

328
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,769
might not be the most, uh,
highest priority work.

329
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:25,138
We just need to do some load
balancing and some estimates

330
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,739
as far as, like,
how long is it gonna take

331
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,174
to get this shit done,
'cause people--

332
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,876
if people don't tell us that,

333
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:32,045
we might be fucked already
and we don't even know it.

334
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,813
Rice: Um, but, yes, Ray,
you're correct.

335
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:37,583
The, um, the right reaction
to this is,

336
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,753
it's a lot to do in two--
in two months and change.

337
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,455
Crook: Yeah.
Rice: So, um, I think

338
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,023
that's why we wanted to
make sure that these dates

339
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,425
get in front of everybody's
eyes and that people

340
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,826
are looking at it differently.

341
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,194
Hansen: Is it reasonable?
I mean, or are you--

342
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,329
or you're like,
I don't know, man,

343
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,666
'cause your gut checks
are usually pretty good.

344
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,735
Crook: Wow.

345
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:58,104
Yeah, but I think it's--
I think it'd be all right.

346
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,372
Do you think the GPs
are gonna be--I mean,

347
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:00,773
'cause there was a time where

348
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,775
there were gonna be
four of them.

349
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,477
Now there's two of them.

350
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,579
Rice: We're getting all the
box stuff ready to go

351
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,550
and actually manufacturing
in, like, February, um,

352
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,253
to where discs would
be pressed in mid-March.

353
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,824
Kipnis: Yeah, and the game--does
the game run on the PS4?

354
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,692
Franzke: Nope.
Kipnis: Yeah.

355
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,329
And--and I think it's really important to have a,

356
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,865
"Okay, Tim, this is it,
like, you can't..."

357
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,434
Hansen: Yeah.
Kipnis: Like, absolute content complete

358
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,770
from, like, Tim content
complete maybe.

359
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,105
Hansen: Last call for alcohol.

360
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,272
Kipnis: Yeah, last call.

361
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,242
Let's just call it that,
last call.

362
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,411
It's really hard to,
as a creator,

363
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,213
to turn yourself off.

364
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,782
What I want to do is
be able to account for that

365
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,817
and I want Tim to be able
to do that.

366
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,119
I want him to be able to, like,

367
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,720
"Oh, God, this is it,
that's right,

368
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,822
I can't add anymore after this."

369
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,225
And I want him to be able
to, like, have that time

370
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,094
and account for it
in our--in our milestone,

371
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,562
like, timeline and stuff.

372
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,064
Because I want him to be, like,

373
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,799
happy with what we come up with.

374
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,301
Because we know
his creative process,

375
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:06,405
it's important for us to
schedule it appropriately.

376
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,141
Rice: Yeah, um...
Kipnis: Yeah, I didn't realize,

377
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,343
like, how soon the beta was.

378
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,311
Jesus Christ.
Rice: Yeah, and I don't know, Matt,

379
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:15,014
like, right now every--
there's a lot of hands on Grim,

380
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,883
but, like, obviously that's
just a near-term problem

381
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,151
that's being solved soon.

382
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,319
But after that, um, yeah,

383
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,689
I don't know
what kind of, uh, strings

384
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,693
we can pull with people
on other teams, um, as needed.

385
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,797
Hansen: They can't. I mean, we
have milestones. We won't get paid.

386
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,165
If we don't get paid
then the studio shuts down.

387
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,866
Rice: That's what I thought.

388
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,301
So I was just making sure
that that was the case.

389
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,736
Hansen: I'm just gonna be totally
blunt with you guys,

390
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,404
but you can't touch
(redacted).

391
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,872
Kipnis: Yeah.
Hansen: I'm sorry.

392
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,474
Franzke: Yeah.

393
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:42,742
All right.
Rice: Cool.

394
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:43,776
Franzke: Let's make this happen, huh?

395
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,878
Rice: Yeah.
All right.

396
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,147
Like, you guys are the
right people to ask about this.

397
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,416
Like what--what does gut say
about the timeline?

398
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,319
It's basically two months
till pencils down.

399
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:58,157
Inversin: I'm not totally scared just
yet, but I might be terrified.

400
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,226
We'll see.

401
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,394
[Offscreen] Did you get to learn
anything from Lydia

402
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,763
when she was still here?

403
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,231
Panya: No.

404
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,733
She had a lot of
the Act 1 shader stuff,

405
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,769
so, like, her signature's
over everything

406
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,737
so I can pick up where
she left off in that sense.

407
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:15,241
Uh, but she's not here for me
to kind of ask questions.

408
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,343
Scheduling with effects
is always kind of scary,

409
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,011
'cause there's always this,
you know,

410
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,514
four-week window
at the end for polish,

411
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,382
and, of course everybody
wants to polish at the end,

412
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,519
even design wants to polish,
and that trickles down.

413
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,621
Animations get tweaked
at the end,

414
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,857
and then visual effects
and sound effects

415
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:34,694
are the last two guys to
kind of get, uh, to touch it.

416
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:38,030
So as long as everyone
knows that the sound effects

417
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,600
and the visual effects guys are
last and they give some buffer,

418
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,402
then we shouldn't be too,
uh, too screwed.

419
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,804
Stoddard: I want to make sure
German gets hit

420
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:49,041
because we have
to re-volume graph

421
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:53,045
and re-special effects process
all of the German recording

422
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:56,082
for Act 1 and Act 2,
and that's a tall order.

423
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:59,385
Rice: Yeah, and it's getting
delivered beginning of February, right,

424
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,854
and then don't we--is the plan
to have outsourcer on it

425
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,556
that should take,
like, three weeks?

426
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,258
Stoddard: We--yeah.
Hansen: We have Ashley coming in.

427
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,792
Stoddard: Yeah.
Hansen: And she'll be, uh, helping...

428
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:09,794
-...specifically for this work.
Rice: Yeah.

429
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,198
Schafer: I would like to ask you
to join me in welcoming

430
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,699
Ashley Coull to Double Fine.

431
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,834
There she is over there.

432
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,103
Ashley.

433
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,105
Coull: You know, a contract.
It's a short amount of time

434
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,807
and, you know, there--
there's no--there's no guarantee,

435
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,076
and it was a staggering amount
of work as well,

436
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,845
but, uh, the opportunity
to be here

437
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:28,079
and be a part of
this community, uh,

438
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,715
Camden even pulled me out--
pulled me out of work one day,

439
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,351
and I think he got about halfway
through the sentence of, "Hey,

440
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,553
so there's this contract thing,"
and I was like, "Yes."

441
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:38,691
And he was like, "I--uh,
yeah," and I was like, "Yeah."

442
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,826
Um, and that's kind of how--how

443
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,828
the balls got--got rolling,
I guess.

444
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,997
Schafer: Because we have German VO
in the game, which is awesome,

445
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,532
and it sounds crazy.
I started playing it.

446
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,867
I mean, I don't mean
crazy, I mean

447
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,735
in a language
that is not my own.

448
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,737
-German Vella: Hallo?
Schafer: There we go.

449
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,506
[Coughing]

450
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,274
That's a German cough, obviously.

451
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,274
[Disproving sigh]

452
00:17:57,274 --> 00:17:59,045
[Laughter]

453
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,513
I really like the German version. I'm gonna

454
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,148
play through the whole thing
in German.

455
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,783
Stoddard: Yeah, that was--
that was a--

456
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,184
the was a big, big thing,

457
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,886
so she's just--
she's kicking ass,

458
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,154
Paul is kicking ass.

459
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,555
He really is stepping up.

460
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,656
I mean, it's like kind of

461
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,358
both their moments to step up.

462
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,593
O'Rourke: I mean, it's always enjoyable.
Tim's writing

463
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,794
is hilarious most of the time

464
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,028
and it's really good to just--

465
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,063
like, usually when I'm editing--

466
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,130
I don't want to talk bad about,

467
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,165
like, sports games or anything,

468
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:20,199
but if I had to edit, like,

469
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,367
Madden dialogue all day,

470
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,468
probably kill myself.

471
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,803
But going through Tim's stuff

472
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,204
is actually pretty enjoyable.

473
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,106
Um, I gave him a huge cut scene

474
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,207
the other day.

475
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,308
Dude, here's a big moment,

476
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,376
go do it,

477
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,345
come back when it's done.

478
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:35,815
And he came back
and it was damn near perfect.

479
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:39,485
Like he nailed it, so I'm like, okay,
I'm not worried anymore.

480
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,623
The layoffs were not good, um...

481
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,757
It's definitely--

482
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,793
This--this company
is under stress.

483
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,629
Everybody is being super pro
and they're making good product,

484
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,765
but, like, it's--
it's heavy duty right now.

485
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:57,069
And I'm just really happy to
see this team kind of gel,

486
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,639
uh, you know, in the trenches
and really get it.

487
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,775
Me?

488
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:08,814
(speaking in German)

489
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:12,018
[Offscreen] What was that?
Franzke: I--what?

490
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,380
[Laughter]

491
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:19,492
Coull: Uh, I said I'm editing
all the German lines.

492
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,793
Franzke: Can I read--
can I read this?

493
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,120
[Laughter]

494
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,631
Franzke: Oh.

495
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:26,832
Rice: We've gone through this now

496
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,467
with all the leads, yeah,

497
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,802
but, um, yeah, now we wanted

498
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,137
to present it it to you.

499
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,171
The next week is--

500
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,040
Schafer: Last set call.

501
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,841
Rice: Huh?
Schafer: Tim last call...

502
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,343
Rice: Yeah, we'll get to that.

503
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,046
So like, tomorrow the hope
is during stand-ups

504
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:41,814
to, like, relay this whole
thing to the entire team,

505
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,315
not just the leads.

506
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,617
And I feel like

507
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:45,651
we gotta kinda give, like,

508
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,620
a bit of a sense of urgency

509
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,688
and just, like,
that kind of thing.

510
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,192
But I feel like it's also trying
to put people's fears to rest,

511
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,827
which would--I think one of
the big ones is that,

512
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,629
like, we're gonna continue
to iterate on the game...

513
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:57,797
-...and things like that.
Schafer: So terrify them with

514
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,166
the deadlines and put
all their fears to rest.

515
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,736
Rice: And then hopefully,
uh, just pep rally,

516
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,471
pump people up?

517
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:09,575
Schafer: If we use the words
"dig deep" at any point, I'm just--

518
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,843
Hansen: Will you say it?
Schafer: No.

519
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,211
Rice: No.
Schafer: There's always a point

520
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,279
where someone talks about digging deep,

521
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,346
and I just--

522
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,482
I don't want to say that.

523
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:17,817
So we all gotta dig deep,
you guys.

524
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,218
Hansen: All right.
Rice: Yeah, I pro--

525
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,053
I think I might put the dates

526
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,522
on the whiteboard again, too,

527
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,824
just so everyone can look
at them all the time.

528
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,826
Schafer: If they view that,
they'll film it.

529
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:27,827
Rice: Yeah, red, white, and blue.

530
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,795
Romero: That's encouraging.

531
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,031
Broken Age, fuck yeah.

532
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,669
Schafer: Does that help?

533
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,338
Romero: Tim last call.
Is that a milestone?

534
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,840
Rice: Fuck yes.
Romero: Okay.

535
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,877
We submit to ratings boards
on the fourth?

536
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,545
Rice: Yeah, I think it's that--

537
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,481
Kipnis: When do we
know what line...?

538
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,015
Crook: Tim said he would try
to call him. When he said

539
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,017
you're hitting the line,
it's okay.

540
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:55,721
Maybe I just gotta
try to find one that...

541
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,023
Rice: Ready? So we've been meeting

542
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,425
production team with the leads

543
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,161
to come up with
closing plan stuff.

544
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,763
So next Friday we have
our next Sony milestone,

545
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,265
which Oliver is working on.

546
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,768
I think the big thing is
PlayStation 4 running.

547
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,837
Schafer: Is there anything on there
new or shocking to anyone?

548
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,706
Crook: It's all shocking,
but nothing's new.

549
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,241
There's nothing new.

550
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,775
Schafer: There is a lot of stuff to do

551
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,743
in a short amount of time,

552
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,712
but there's no big unknowns

553
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:20,846
to me, at least, on it.

554
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:23,582
There's no design yet to do,

555
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,552
dialogue yet to write,
and big ques--

556
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,487
things that could
explode into--

557
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,190
I mean, like, it seems like it's
a known amount of work now

558
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,559
that can't expand,

559
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:38,130
and, um, and it's clear
that it can't slip

560
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,866
because you can see
the commitments that are on it.

561
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,102
As far as I'm concerned,
like, everything is just no--

562
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:45,771
everything just has to be
pushed through the machinery,

563
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,706
and that's the easy part,

564
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:50,442
except for it's hard.

565
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:54,280
No, we're--we're the dream team,
all here together.

566
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,148
For some reason,
to me it's always relaxing

567
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,150
when it's finite
even if it is tight

568
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,452
because you know when
it's gonna be over.

569
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,855
These next three weeks are
really where the game goes

570
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,823
from being good
to great mostly.

571
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:09,161
So, um, it's gonna
be exciting

572
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,031
and, uh, if we have
to order food,

573
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,799
we'll order food.

574
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,234
Crook: Food.

575
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:16,836
Boston Market?

576
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,404
Schafer: No.
Crook: Promise Boston Market, I'll--

577
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,306
Schafer: Wait, you want Boston--
Crook: I'll work late if you--

578
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:21,473
No, I'm just kidding.
Kipnis: Wow.

579
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,677
Crook: Just kidding.

580
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,645
Schafer: If you've gotta lure
a man away from his family,

581
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:27,746
make it
Boston Market.

582
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,215
Crook: Yeah.

583
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,749
Schafer: It's like there's
love in that meal.

584
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,551
Kipnis: That's--that's what
Caroline did for us

585
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:33,752
during Psychonauts.

586
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,387
Remember that?
Rice: Boston Market?

587
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,590
Kipnis: Boston Market,
like, every night.

588
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,458
Crook: Yep.
Kipnis: And, uh, and I gained--

589
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,293
I gained, like, 15 pounds
during during crunch.

590
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,761
Schafer: That's to keep you in your seat.

591
00:22:43,380 --> 00:23:08,100
[Music]

592
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,290
Schafer: Uh, on "Reds," we did a
whole play-through of the team

593
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,825
of the finale of the game
to figure out

594
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:16,495
how to push that
towards, um, completion.

595
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:21,400
We are also starting
on the PS4 version.

596
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,735
Hansen: So we have a milestone
on the 23rd,

597
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,536
and that's to have it, like,

598
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,406
"playable," um,
on that platform, so--

599
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,807
But it looks like that's
come along really well,

600
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,377
so good job, Oliver.

601
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:34,680
Schafer: Look at it playing on the PS4.

602
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,049
[Offscreen] How's the port process
been going in general?

603
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,450
Franzke: It's good.
We essentially added

604
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,519
PlayStation 4
and PlayStation Vita

605
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,854
to a list of platforms,

606
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:43,689
but kept the ship date the same,

607
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:46,725
um, so that makes things
a bit more interesting.

608
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,427
I love working on consoles,

609
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,695
but it's a very different
kind of challenge, like,

610
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:52,531
for example, the Vita is
very memory constrained,

611
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,466
um, so that, you know,

612
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:58,137
it's--it's a very tight
memory budget for--for the game,

613
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:01,874
and if you're just leaking
some memory somewhere,

614
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:04,009
like, you're gonna have
a bad time later on,

615
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,744
so there are, like, a lot
of really interesting things

616
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,413
you need to take
into consideration.

617
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,748
Or can you compress the data
in some way and stuff like that.

618
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,750
And I think the end--
the end will be tough,

619
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,785
for sure, shipping.

620
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:16,789
Like, so, for--for consoles, um,

621
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,991
what you have to do
in order to release games

622
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:21,560
is you have to go to something
that's called certifications.

623
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,496
The next milestone is
on the 20th, which is--

624
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,032
like, it's very ominously
called, like, beta

625
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,435
which is supposed to be
TRC complete,

626
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:31,370
uh, essentially for Sony

627
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,039
so there's a lot of stuff that
needs to happen before that.

628
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,641
Those are all
the requirements you need

629
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,777
for shipping a game
on a--on a Sony platform.

630
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,012
Schafer: I'm sure we're TRC complete.

631
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,214
Franzke: Oh, yeah, no problem.

632
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:45,584
Um, so they will
essentially, like, run a game

633
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:48,754
and make sure that every one
of those requirements is met.

634
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:53,425
[Offscreen] How does stuff like
Assassin's Creed happen?

635
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,195
Oliver: Uh, I'd rather
not comment on that.

636
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,664
It's really sad, because
I'm pretty sure all the people

637
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,399
who worked on the game,
you know,

638
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,736
didn't want to release
something that's substandard.

639
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:06,772
Um, so very often, it's--it's--

640
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,273
actually really sad
for the developers,

641
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,708
but there's a lot
of, like, pressure

642
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,678
from various departments

643
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,647
to make the game happen essentially.

644
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,117
Are you feeling some form
of pressure like that now?

645
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:20,486
Well, I mean, but if you--
if you don't have a publisher

646
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:23,088
who's, like, does what,
uh, needs to happen,

647
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:26,225
but as you can see,
everything is so tightly packed,

648
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:29,228
uh, that there's really no time
to slip any of those milestones.

649
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,832
Franzke: Yes, please.
-Okay.

650
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,267
See, crunch has
already started.

651
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:36,835
Schafer: Yeah, we're getting
near the end where

652
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,404
some nights people
are working late

653
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:41,874
and we're ordering food,
and, um...

654
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,777
and hopefully that won't be
too long till it's over.

655
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,678
And people who are
staying late now, it's 'cause

656
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:47,813
they want to make sure
the game is really good.

657
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:57,400
[Music]

658
00:25:57,823 --> 00:25:59,324
I know the biggest hurdle
is just the amount

659
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,193
of work there is to do.

660
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:04,830
Uh, we have to do a whole bunch
of cut scenes.

661
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,098
Still have to go in.

662
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:08,133
Crook: Camden there was
the issue with, uh,

663
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,269
Bob Chothra
coming out of the mountain

664
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,770
that we were gonna--

665
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,872
did you talk to Tim
about that and Peter?

666
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,041
I don't know about--
I'm in that scene still.

667
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,743
We're making some changes,
so I just--

668
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,244
Stoddard: Okay.

669
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,013
Schafer: Just saying that
gave Ray a headache.

670
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,314
Offscreen: How is the ending
cut scene coming along,

671
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,249
since that was sort of, uh--
that had to be--

672
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,151
the music had to be done,
so that was kind of locked.

673
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,853
Schafer: Yeah, yeah, 'cause we kind
of locked it, but I feel good

674
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:30,389
about the pacing of that,
just based on the music.

675
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:33,425
Um, and it was so big we had to
split it between two animators,

676
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,594
Miyuki and Chris Lam.

677
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,862
So Miyuki was doing
the first half

678
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:38,864
and Chris was doing
the second half.

679
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:41,333
And then we're gonna
stitch it back together.

680
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,534
Oh, I like that.
That's a good idea.

681
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:43,569
Crook: Yeah, that was really good.

682
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:45,003
That's cute.

683
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:52,010
Richardson: Like, uh, so
many characters, and...

684
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,145
and it's kind of a big thing, right?

685
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,481
It's ending,
end of the game,

686
00:26:55,481 --> 00:27:00,385
so that's kind of exciting,
but still goin' like,

687
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,688
"Ooh, that's
a lot of things to do."

688
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,690
Crook: Maybe not the happy eyes?
Lam: No.

689
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:09,394
Schafer: Yeah, like, the delirious eyes,
like yay, he's more like...

690
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,230
Hm.

691
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,831
"You run, I got this."

692
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,700
Crook: All right.
Schafer: "Save yourself."

693
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,468
Thumb's up.

694
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,505
Crook: Yeah, he got that on film.
We might need to...

695
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,773
Schafer: This ping pong ball, his face.

696
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,743
Lam: The parts that I have to do
that are kind of those,

697
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,845
you know, resolution moments,

698
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,147
they're gonna be
a little challenging but--

699
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,317
to get the expressions
on the characters right

700
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,086
so that you know
that they're thinking,

701
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:37,055
they're not just staring into
dead space and stuff like that.

702
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,790
Crook: Think you got enough info there?

703
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,825
Okay.
Lam: Yes.

704
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,059
Crook: The plan is to just take it

705
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,595
to that, um, shippable stage.

706
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:46,698
And then, uh, that will allow
all the effects and the sound

707
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,635
to get put in, um, 'cause all
the timing will be locked down.

708
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:51,803
So the--the plan is that
they'll go back to it, uh,

709
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,539
to do some polish, um,

710
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,073
after we get all the content in.

711
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,742
Schafer: Is this a good time
to look at it?

712
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:59,478
It would be a good time
to look at it, yes.

713
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:01,513
It doesn't--sometimes it
seems like in that whole thing,

714
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,048
there's not a shot that shows--

715
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:06,418
that really shows
the entire scene.

716
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:07,653
Schafer: But, I mean,
you know what's left

717
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:08,854
and you know what's right.

718
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,556
Crook: Yeah, like, this is
the only shot we have.

719
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:13,725
Rice: That's the shot
that shows most--

720
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,227
Crook: What--uh, I don't know.

721
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:17,729
I just kept thinking that, like--

722
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:18,830
You could almost do--
Rice: if it's a flip book,

723
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,998
you could almost--you could have

724
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,166
other people that we don't know

725
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,200
that are on the sides

726
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,235
from both villages.

727
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:24,870
Crook: All these people, like here.

728
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,705
Schafer: But where do they come from?
Crook: Well, they came from...

729
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,307
Rice: From the monster lands town,

730
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,075
like, there's a big battle
going on.

731
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,843
They've come to gawk.

732
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:32,878
Crook: That's fine.
I mean, if you're--

733
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,349
But we--but we can't--
we don't want...

734
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,117
-...to animate more people.
Stoddard: Yeah, yeah, I know.

735
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,152
Rice: But that's what you're saying.
Schafer: It's really important

736
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,219
not to add features to the game

737
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,654
at this point Ray.

738
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,856
I like the melting
you're adding.

739
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:47,826
I wouldn't jump to
that melting platform.

740
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:48,794
Crook: Yeah, that's true.
She has no shoes.

741
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:51,396
Camden: She's tough. She's a baker.

742
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,998
Crook: She walks on coals.
Schafer: She doesn't use

743
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,399
oven mitts anymore.

744
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,401
Oh, that's good.
That's perfect.

745
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,573
So I think this would be--
this needs something here.

746
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,343
Inversin: It--it has something, not
in this scene, but there is--

747
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,445
I can--I can move it into that scene also if you want.

748
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,347
Schafer: 'Cause it seemed like
he was backing up from nothing.

749
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,616
Inversin: So, like, it's in there, too,
so I can add it to the other one.

750
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,217
Schafer: I just think it--think it
could be, like, half as much?

751
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,619
Crook: That looks really cool.

752
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:16,188
Schafer: It kind of explains
why he jumps now.

753
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,557
That's perfect. I think that's
perfect as far as the rain goes.

754
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,758
-Awesome.
-Yeah.

755
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,792
-Then we're done.
-Yeah.

756
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,060
That was easy.

757
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,195
Boop boop. Yeah,
that was really good.

758
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,130
Thanks.

759
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,036
Oh, crying for us.

760
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:34,573
Crook: Yeah.

761
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,900
[Music]

762
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:42,481
Rice: But we're finally now getting
down to-- to final days, I guess.

763
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:51,340
[Music]

764
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:54,793
Crook: But, yeah, we're all a little
on edge, a little stressed out,

765
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,262
but, um, it'll be okay.

766
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:01,767
Hansen: Anna's here almost
constantly, and, you know, I can--

767
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,602
I see the light at the end
of the tunnel.

768
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:05,003
We love these games,
but, you know,

769
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:08,140
we all kind of need
to take a break.

770
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,075
And people need
to get some sleep, too.

771
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:12,711
It's been a rough few months.

772
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:16,615
Crook: I mean, we're gonna be
pushing to the very end.

773
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:19,184
[Off screen] Like that guy there.
Crook: Oh yeah he is.

774
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,019
I think he didn't go home
last night.

775
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,855
But apparently he has, like,
a little bed over there.

776
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,425
So I'm just like,
that's not a good thing.

777
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,793
Stoddard: I don't want
to romanticize it.

778
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,261
I know--I know
that Tim wants to show

779
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:30,729
how the sausage gets made,

780
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:33,765
and this has been--

781
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,500
this has been hard.

782
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,735
Schafer: We're also getting
kind of griefed

783
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:40,372
by, um, certain
fringe organizations

784
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:42,574
and attack groups organized,

785
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,476
and, uh, that was a bummer.

786
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,611
And then we had the layoffs
which were a huge bummer.

787
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:50,649
And, um, a bunch of bad news.

788
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:54,352
Rice: There is, like, a group
of people that are hoping

789
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,755
that we won't succeed
for some weird reason,

790
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:59,858
um, or that are at least
heavily scrutinizing us.

791
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,426
And it definitely has been
something that's been

792
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,061
weighing on a lot of people.

793
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,864
Franzke: The endless thing of,
like, people, like, oh, well,

794
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,733
maybe they shouldn't have
taken the--the money

795
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:10,102
and only make half the game.
Well, you know,

796
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:11,703
all I can say to that
is, like,

797
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,271
if you would be,
like, we're sitting here,

798
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,841
you know, working our asses
off to make this game.

799
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,375
Kipnis: And, like, you do,
you question yourself.

800
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,377
Like, yeah, maybe we--
what the fuck,

801
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,812
maybe we don't know
what the--what we're doing.

802
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,514
Who knows?

803
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,015
But you just have to trust
and know, like,

804
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,383
this is actually--
game development

805
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,486
is not an easy thing.

806
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,221
Schafer: And now we're gonna
ship Broken Age,

807
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,856
and that's all gonna be great.

808
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:32,624
So, um, it's a relief

809
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:35,060
to get out of that--
out of that period.

810
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,134
[Offscreen] What's going on right now
at this stage of the project?

811
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:44,836
Romero: So where we are is,
we're less than a month out

812
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,271
from our first submission,

813
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,206
which is the, um,
where you submit to Sony

814
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,675
and we release
the mastering for the PC,

815
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,844
physical copies
that we're doing with Nordic.

816
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,646
So the 20th is the big day
where just everything

817
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:58,083
has to sort of
be done by that point.

818
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,552
Rice: Uh, yes, I've been working on
some Nordic stuff, too,

819
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:03,789
along with Vic. Um...
We got the box prints

820
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,524
from them and they just
look a little bit dark

821
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,092
so we're doing, like,
another round on those

822
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,694
before they actually start printing them in bulk.

823
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,596
Uh, but hopefully
that'll happen soon.

824
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,332
Schafer: But we don't get a sample
before they make a zillion of them?

825
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,134
Rice: No, unfortunately.
Schafer: Exciting.

826
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,169
Rice: Yeah.
Schafer: That's exciting.

827
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:18,236
This is just one of Cory's

828
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,304
mock-ups of the box.

829
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,006
This is the box.

830
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,674
This is--the disc's not
gonna look like that.

831
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,576
I wanted the disc to be
the O from Broken Age.

832
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,245
This is gonna be like the O,
and that's the box.

833
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:30,015
And we're first looking at it, we're like, this is cool

834
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:31,483
'cause it shows the split thing,

835
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:34,252
but it really overemphasizes Vella over Shay,

836
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,621
'cause Shay's upside down
so he's, like, easier to ignore.

837
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,856
It was like,
wouldn't it be crazy

838
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,090
if we could print Vella and Shay

839
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,092
on a separate clear slipcover,

840
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,527
and then you could slide it off

841
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,162
and turn it around
and slide it back down

842
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,731
and then Shay would be
in Vella's world and vice versa,

843
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:50,335
Which, no spoilers, but that's
some foreshadowing there.

844
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,403
And it would be so neat.

845
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:52,771
It would be like Led Zeppelin.

846
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:53,872
Rice: We'll nail it.
It'll be great.

847
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,074
-Um...
Kipnis: Wow.

848
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:03,615
Romero: So right now the big tasks
are-- or the big areas are bugs.

849
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:05,350
O'Rourke: Yeah, we're in
Starship Troopers mode basically,

850
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,185
just killing all the bugs.

851
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,987
Schafer: Taking showers
together or what are you--

852
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,689
Coull: No.
Schafer: I'm sorry, that's...

853
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:11,857
not the first thing
I think about.

854
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:13,058
O'Rouke: There's the
daily shower scene

855
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:16,294
in the audio room.

856
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:19,164
Kipnis: I'm a little bit concerned
about our deadline.

857
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,100
Like, right here it says
A and B bugs only.

858
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,102
Like, that's not likely
gonna happen,

859
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,537
especially since
we have brand new cut scenes.

860
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:26,605
Schafer: Starting now or next week?

861
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:27,672
Kipnis: Next week.

862
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,608
Uh, that's likely not happening

863
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:32,677
because we have a bunch of
new, um, cut scenes coming.

864
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:36,314
Content is still coming in
and we can't actually do that

865
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,016
until all content
is in the game.

866
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,551
Schafer: What's this
selective bug fixing?

867
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:41,853
Almost sounds more open-ended
than A and B

868
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,755
'cause we select to do a C.

869
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,056
Right, that's how that works?

870
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,625
Kipnis: Nope.
Rice: I don't think so.

871
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,760
Kipnis: But if you play the game
all the way through, um,

872
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,794
from Act 1,

873
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:52,097
that Act 1 is very clean,

874
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:54,165
and we have to make Act 2
look that clean,

875
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,668
and that's a lot
of C-bug fixing.

876
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,670
And so, like, we can't
suddenly switch

877
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,105
to A and Bs only next week.

878
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:01,406
Like, it's just not--
it's gonna be

879
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,309
basically like a, I don't know,

880
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:07,312
not a very clean game, I guess.

881
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:11,149
Romero: Uh, Act 2 is interesting
because we're not just doing PC,

882
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,583
Mac, and Linux digital,

883
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,151
um, we're doing physical,

884
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,755
when--and really that goes back
to the old school way,

885
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:18,723
which is you get to the point
in the project

886
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,226
where you're gonna
ship a physical disc,

887
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,527
you have to cut off bug fixing.

888
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:23,828
You have to be certain that

889
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,496
the build you're shipping
is the one,

890
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,464
because someone's gonna,
in theory,

891
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,868
buy the box and get the game,

892
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:32,704
and that has to have all the,
you know, be bug-free as--

893
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,806
as bug-free as possible
and as solid as possible,

894
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:38,109
so they'll just have the disc and
the game that's on there.

895
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,444
That's it.

896
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,879
Kipnis: I don't have
confidence at the moment

897
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,746
that we have--we're really

898
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:45,349
at the bug count that we are.

899
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,818
Or, like, I--I expect that

900
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,554
the bugs will increase tremendously,

901
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,690
or should, because I think
they are in there.

902
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,358
Romero: They're still there.
Kipnis: Yeah.

903
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:54,859
Franzke: It's still gonna be good,
like, I mean, this game

904
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,360
has been out for such a long time, I think

905
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,662
it's gonna be stable
and it's gonna be good,

906
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,431
but there's always, like,

907
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:02,033
so much more
that we would have liked to do

908
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,202
and, like, we're now
at a point where

909
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,503
that's just not
gonna be possible.

910
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,038
We need to, you know,

911
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,773
make sure that
the game is stable.

912
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,775
You know, you look--
you look at your bug database

913
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,644
and you list some issues
that you have in there

914
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:14,346
and it's, like, a lot,

915
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,781
and it's like, how are we gonna
be able to--to finish that?

916
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:26,524
We'll have to probably do
some bug triaging next week

917
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,560
to just see kind of, okay, well,
all of these issues

918
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,562
that are in the bug database
right now,

919
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:33,765
which one are we realistically
gonna be able to even do now?

920
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,166
And then they have to--
there will

921
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,202
have to be
some hard decisions.

922
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:40,005
It's like, okay, well, we can
only do one or the other,

923
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:41,606
so which one of these issues,

924
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,808
polish items is more important
to you?

925
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:46,811
And then we're gonna do that
but not the other.

926
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,147
And it's just the nature
of the beast.

927
00:35:49,640 --> 00:36:04,160
[Music]

928
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:07,198
Hansen: Resources in 12.
Schafer: That would be great.

929
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,801
Uh, and yeah,
we'll have to re--

930
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:11,136
and I mean, obviously,

931
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,270
analyze the bugs every day

932
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,638
and how they're tracking.

933
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,407
Are all the GPs back
from sickness?

934
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,175
Hansen: No, Anna's still out.
Stoddard: Two down.

935
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,810
Hansen: But--
Schafer: She's gonna be out today, too?

936
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,045
Hansen: She's trying to get
some medicine that'll

937
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:20,779
allow her to work this week,

938
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,414
so she's that bad.

939
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:23,715
Schafer: Holy cow.

940
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,418
Crook: She was working
really late hours.

941
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:27,552
I think she was probably--

942
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:28,853
Her immune system was already

943
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,022
pretty vulnerable,

944
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:35,126
and, um, and she--she
got whatever, I don't know.

945
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,528
I hope--I don't know,
she hasn't said.

946
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:37,796
She went to the doctor.

947
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:38,830
Hopefully it's not pneumonia

948
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,032
or something, but, um,

949
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,634
hopefully she'll be back with us on Monday.

950
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:45,437
But--but we know that
the most important thing for her

951
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:46,838
is just to get better.

952
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,074
You know,
it's just a video game.

953
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:51,376
You know, she's, you know,

954
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,811
her health is
the most important thing,

955
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:56,314
so, um, so that's why
it's been great.

956
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,817
Everyone has just jumped in
to try and help out,

957
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,852
and nobody blames anybody
for anything.

958
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,754
-It's just one of those things.
Boehle: I'll probably just filter,

959
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:06,157
like, Anna's open or new bugs,
like, priority two and higher,

960
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:07,492
and then if there's anything
UI related,

961
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:08,993
I'll just grab those and--

962
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,728
Franzke: Right.
Yeah, I think we have to.

963
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,997
I mean, it's just kind of--
sounds like Anna's

964
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,432
hit pretty hard.

965
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,867
Hansen: But it's still difficult
because, you know,

966
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,769
there's a lot of ownership
over the code,

967
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:21,039
so Anna will be able to get
something done a lot faster

968
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:22,607
than anybody else just 'cause
she's so familiar

969
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,843
with all the inner workings of
how this stuff is all hooked up.

970
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,544
That makes it more difficult, for sure,

971
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,012
'cause all the pressure's
on her right now.

972
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,581
Rice: I guess at least through
the week and then,

973
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,182
I just--I guess I wonder
when we're gonna get

974
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,984
to other platform work,

975
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,719
but for now it's obvious.

976
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,287
It seems like this is
until we're locking stuff down.

977
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:37,722
Franzke: I mean, like, whenever
there's an actual

978
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,724
pre-cert issue
coming in from Sony,

979
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,159
I'm jumping on it right away

980
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,861
because I want to get them,

981
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:44,129
like, fixed as soon as possible.

982
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:45,430
But so far it's been
pretty good.

983
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,398
I think actually
not that many bugs

984
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,000
been reported from pre-certs.

985
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,136
Rice: So, yeah, whathaveibeenworkingon?
We have a couple things.

986
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:54,706
Today we set up a bug triage meeting
with all of the leads.

987
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,008
So, um, producers
and leads and Tim,

988
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,344
are gonna kind of read through
everything in the bug database,

989
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:01,813
reevaluating where we are
with that.

990
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:03,748
So that'll be happening
this afternoon.

991
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,784
Schafer: Hey, everybody, hello.
Rice: Hi.

992
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,387
Schafer: This is probably the
last meeting of the project, right?

993
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,788
Rice: Um...
Probably not.

994
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,590
Schafer: We're so close.
Rice: Big one, though.

995
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,092
Rice: It's a big one.
Franzke: Apart from the meeting

996
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,794
where we get
all the royalty checks?

997
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,228
Schafer: Yeah, that's after.
That's after.

998
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,497
We have to ship it first, Oliver.

999
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:21,466
But yeah, so we're gonna
look over the bug database

1000
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,801
and see if we can get rid
of some bugs.

1001
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,671
Rice: I think the hope is really
just trying to get an idea

1002
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,106
of which ones
we definitely need to fix

1003
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:29,841
and which ones
might be okay to drop.

1004
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:34,612
And this is specifically for
the date in two weeks from now,

1005
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,315
which is like pressing it
to the disc for PC.

1006
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,851
So I guess it's, like, what are we
gonna not feel comfortable

1007
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:43,621
having fixed before
that disc is pressed.

1008
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,023
And how bad is the situation right now?

1009
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,157
'Cause I'm hearing things like

1010
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,225
the bugs aren't gonna be fixed

1011
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:48,393
by the ship date and all that.

1012
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:50,061
I mean, from Vic's last email,

1013
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,197
it sounds like we're tracking
about half the speed

1014
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:55,300
um, that we would need to be
for fixing these 250.

1015
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,369
Um, I guess it's just, like,
what's the line we can draw

1016
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,805
where we're comfortable that it's a solid build

1017
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,541
that's not gonna crash
that gives a good experience.

1018
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,610
And, yeah, maybe there's,
like, some polish stuff

1019
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,844
that would have been
nice to be in there

1020
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,280
but at least it's in

1021
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,049
versions that get patched.

1022
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,517
Hansen: I mean, every game that ships

1023
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,052
ships with bugs, period.

1024
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,753
They're--I mean,
it's just unavoidable.

1025
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,422
You can keep testing a game forever.

1026
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:18,723
It's just you have
to get to the point

1027
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:19,757
where you feel like

1028
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:22,060
you found things that are--

1029
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,995
you know, that most people
are likely to run into

1030
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,530
and you've addressed
all that stuff.

1031
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,065
Rice: Then, like, there's
certain cut scenes

1032
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,132
when you interact with things

1033
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,200
in the spinning mode where

1034
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,401
she'll then just not be spinning

1035
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,436
all of a sudden and talking,

1036
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:32,503
then it'll go back into

1037
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,672
spinning, like--

1038
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,207
Schafer: I haven't seen that.
Rice: You haven't seen that?

1039
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,675
Schafer: Okay, we should find those.
Rice: I just saw it, like,

1040
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:38,676
last night, so...

1041
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:39,811
Crook: Oh, okay.

1042
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:42,113
Schafer: What stretching arms show?

1043
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:44,515
Crook: When, the wakeup scene?
Schafer: Mm-hm.

1044
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,117
Crook: The arm--It happens twice,
when it grabs him

1045
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,286
and then you can see
at the very top,

1046
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:50,855
you can see, like,
the arms are all wacky.

1047
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,724
Like they're all stretched out and weird.

1048
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,692
Schafer: Is it really ugly?
Romero: Is that...?

1049
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,294
Rice: I think I've seen it.
It's like the top point

1050
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:57,729
is off the side and then where they come in.

1051
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,097
Schafer: If you were a player,
would you say that's

1052
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:00,832
the science fiction, uh...

1053
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:03,134
Crook: It's a sliver of, like,
pulled out stuff.

1054
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:06,004
Franzke: It is a potentially really
risky fix, though, because touching--

1055
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:08,506
Getting that camera
to work right in that scene

1056
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:09,841
was--we spent weeks--

1057
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:11,542
Schafer: It's not just reposing
the hand?

1058
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,845
Franzke: Right. And I really would not
feel comfortable

1059
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:16,080
messing with the cameras unless
we really have to because...

1060
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,149
Schafer: Would you fix it with
the camera or fix it with the animation?

1061
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,884
Crook: We can try and change
up the animation--

1062
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,252
Schafer: But you can't just
straighten up the arm.

1063
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,155
Crook: That's a scary scene.
Schafer: Hm.

1064
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:27,358
Crook: We are trying to take things that maybe--

1065
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,160
small things that
we normally might ask

1066
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,462
the game play programmers to do,

1067
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,831
uh, we're trying
to fix those things ourselves

1068
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:36,134
just because they're so swamped.

1069
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:38,836
But we're not programmers
and we have to be careful.

1070
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:40,305
We don't want to break things.

1071
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,140
So I'm kind of learning
a lot of things.

1072
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,376
Um, I'm learning a few things
about game play programming.

1073
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,312
Schafer: What if Ben Peck
is super miserable

1074
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:50,448
at his new job?
Has anyone called him lately?

1075
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,817
Crook: I saw--I saw him at GDC.
He looked a little miserable.

1076
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,285
Schafer: Yeah, see what I'm saying?
Crook: That was only 'cause

1077
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,586
Anna was giving him mean looks.

1078
00:40:57,255 --> 00:41:00,658
Franzke: I saw him on Friday
and he seemed relatively happy.

1079
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,794
Schafer: Wait, can we see how many
of these we have to go through?

1080
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:06,164
Romero: Uh, so we're at 155.

1081
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:08,733
The bottom goes
all the way to 252.

1082
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:10,201
So we're about a hundred away.

1083
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,738
Schafer: Oh, my God.

1084
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:16,007
Hansen: We don't have a lot of time
in general,

1085
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:20,144
so yeah, in aggregate,
all that stuff is a lot of work.

1086
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,814
'Cause what we're trying to do is, like, get to a point
where

1087
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:26,050
we've addressed everything
we're gonna address

1088
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,520
and then have the game sit
without anybody working on it.

1089
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,157
Just--it's just sitting just
in QA for, like, a week.

1090
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,592
And that's the hard part
'cause we--

1091
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:36,260
we've already
eaten into that week.

1092
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,430
And so we're kind of faced with
the decision now of, like,

1093
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,865
do we just work up
to the deadline

1094
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:42,600
and just ship what we have?

1095
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,335
And there's a huge risk
involved with that.

1096
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,204
But even, like, the small,
minor polish bugs,

1097
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:47,672
it's like,
you get enough of those

1098
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,040
and it does make a huge impact

1099
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,408
on the quality of the game.

1100
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:52,643
Schafer: Yeah, it looks really bad.

1101
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,712
Um, when we print this disc,

1102
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,714
how would people get the patch?

1103
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,116
Franzke: Steam.

1104
00:41:58,116 --> 00:41:59,417
Schafer: So that's the only way
to get the patch

1105
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:00,551
for their disc-based version

1106
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,719
of the game is by using Steam?

1107
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,421
Franzke: Yeah.
Schafer: They can't download it

1108
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:04,789
from our website
or anything like that?

1109
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:05,790
Franzke: Our infrastructure--like,

1110
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,058
we would require to have

1111
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:08,426
some kind of login service

1112
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,828
for people to register accounts.

1113
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:14,799
Schafer: That could be
a huge consumer thing

1114
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:16,701
of them saying I need to--

1115
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,369
in order to get the patch,
I need to join Steam,

1116
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,670
and I don't want to join Steam.

1117
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,105
I bought this disc.
Franzke: Yeah.

1118
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,840
Schafer: So it's not like
in the old days,

1119
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,510
where a patch was just a bunch of LUA files

1120
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,578
that you could just
unpack into the directory

1121
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:29,046
of your game
and it would fix it?

1122
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,648
Franzke: We could, but we have
no infrastructure

1123
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,617
for that right now.

1124
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:34,385
Schafer: On the server side
or in the game?

1125
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,254
In the game would have to have that kind of--

1126
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:39,624
Franzke: We right now have no software
to create an incremental patch.

1127
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,797
Schafer: People are gonna freak out.

1128
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:47,565
Rice: Yeah, well, we don't want
to have to support

1129
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,666
a whole 'nother platform.

1130
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:49,801
And, like, it would mean, like,

1131
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:51,869
building ground
up an infrastructure

1132
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:54,705
for them to be able
to sign in to something.

1133
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:56,240
For us to be able
to host something,

1134
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,875
for us to support a whole 'nother platform.

1135
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,510
Schafer: Well, I just think
the other stuff is--

1136
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,312
like, just 'cause it's
hard for us doesn't mean

1137
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,080
we're not gonna have to
deal with it as a company.

1138
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,850
You know what I mean? Like, as
a huge community or PR problem.

1139
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,853
Rice: This was a red flag
waved as soon as we said

1140
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:10,988
we were gonna do a box copy.

1141
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,857
Franzke: Right, I mean, that's one
of the first things we talked about

1142
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:14,325
is how the patching would work.

1143
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,494
Rice: Yeah, well, we can
handle it case-by-case

1144
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:19,030
and give them a DRM free
code whenever we have to

1145
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,698
for GOG or whatever

1146
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,733
if you think people care
that much about DRM.

1147
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,535
Schafer: I mean, probably be they
wouldn't notice all these things

1148
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,404
like a flicking shadow
or something under the seat.

1149
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:30,041
But it's just that people who
buy DRM free copies of games

1150
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,410
are like, "I'm not signing on
to anything.

1151
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,711
I don't want to sign on
to Steam."

1152
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:36,714
Rice: Right.
Franzke: They hate--they hate Steam.

1153
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,116
Schafer: And they were loud
about that until we made

1154
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,684
the DRM free version
of the game,

1155
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:42,587
the first game, so...

1156
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:44,856
And then what happens
if we ship late to Nordic?

1157
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:47,125
What does Nordic do
if we ship late to them?

1158
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,394
Rice: Uh, the disc is late,
then all the dates shift.

1159
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,562
Schafer: And then what happens?

1160
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:53,631
Rice: Then all the dates shift.

1161
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,832
Schafer: And then what happens.

1162
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:57,535
Rice: Tell Sony and Justin's mad,

1163
00:43:57,535 --> 00:43:59,770
and, yeah.

1164
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,706
Rice: Yeah? I'm just trying
to balance that out

1165
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:06,377
like how bad it would be if--
okay, anyway.

1166
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,445
Maybe they wouldn't notice issues.

1167
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:08,613
Rice: This is why we never wanted

1168
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:10,014
to sim ship a disc.

1169
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:11,215
This is why we wanted to, like,

1170
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:12,250
have the game out there,

1171
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,818
have it be patched and finished

1172
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:16,387
before we did. So as soon as
we signed a contract to sim ship,

1173
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:18,789
we knew it would mean
either finishing it all

1174
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:19,824
and having this period

1175
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,092
or having a build on a disc

1176
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:23,494
that wasn't fully patched.

1177
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,664
Schafer: Say we slipped the
disc date by two weeks.

1178
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,833
Does that mean moving
that revenue out of the plan

1179
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,401
for two weeks
is Justin's problem

1180
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:31,836
or that there's something
bigger with Nordic

1181
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,838
where they have a truck idling

1182
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,439
in the loading dock
for two weeks?

1183
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,642
Rice: It's that. They want us to
right now announce a date.

1184
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:39,076
And Sony wants us
to commit to a date.

1185
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,545
Everyone wants us
to commit to a date.

1186
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:41,646
We've been holding it off because

1187
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:43,347
of all these
moving pieces.

1188
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,016
Schafer: But it sounds like we already
are committed to a date

1189
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,250
if we're saying
we can't slip it.

1190
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,818
Rice: We haven't totally,

1191
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,487
but we should and that's
what he wants to know.

1192
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:50,621
Schafer: Why don't we just
move it two weeks

1193
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:52,056
and then commit to it?

1194
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:53,357
Rice: 'Cause I don't know
that Justin can.

1195
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,792
They've been talking--

1196
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,194
so there's, like,
million pieces in place.

1197
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,762
Schafer: Like, these are all the
ones we know about.

1198
00:44:57,762 --> 00:44:59,397
I'm talking about there's a bug

1199
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:01,299
that we ship on the disc
that is, like every--

1200
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:03,267
it's like the elevator, Manny
locked in the elevator bug.

1201
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:04,735
Rice: Okay.
Schafer: Everyone's posting vines

1202
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,837
about it all over, it's all
over Twitter the next day.

1203
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,706
And everyone's like, everyone's
freaking out about this bug.

1204
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,541
Say I can't this patch
'cause I bought the disc,

1205
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,743
or I was dumb enough
to buy the disc version.

1206
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:15,580
You know, and it's just like
we're ripping off everybody

1207
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,648
and that's the story.

1208
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:20,985
And if it's that on one hand or
slipping the date by two weeks,

1209
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:22,987
I would slip the date
by two weeks.

1210
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:25,456
But I want to know what's
the consequence of that?

1211
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:26,824
Rice: Yeah, we'll talk about it after.

1212
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,726
Schafer: Yeah.

1213
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,297
Romero: Uh, all right,
almost to the forest.

1214
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:34,832
Let's see.

1215
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:35,866
Rice: That was the first
thing I thought

1216
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,368
when we had that conversation.

1217
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:38,402
I was like, oh,
is there wiggle room

1218
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,837
in their production schedule

1219
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,872
for, uh, the box?

1220
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:45,376
And I looked, and no, their
drop dead is, like, the 24th.

1221
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:46,844
And that's why they
wanted it on the 20th

1222
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:49,146
so they could, like,
prepare everything.

1223
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:52,116
Uh, so it would mean pushing
the box date out, which I think,

1224
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:56,120
since it would be our fault
for delivering a build later

1225
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,855
that we'd have to push everything.

1226
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,824
'Cause I think, like, if we
delivered the build on time

1227
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:02,727
and they were the reason
that the box showed up late,

1228
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:05,196
then we could have shipped
and not have it sim shipped.

1229
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:07,999
But, um, yeah, we have
to sim ship with them.

1230
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:11,435
Uh, so, yeah, it would mean, um,

1231
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,038
moving all the other stuff,
which is possible.

1232
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:16,207
It just is, like, going back
to everybody and making sure

1233
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:18,042
that they're okay with it.

1234
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:19,377
And especially since
Anna's been out all week,

1235
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:21,212
it's made it even trickier.

1236
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:23,781
We've got, like, all the other
programmers piling on now

1237
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,650
to try and help out.

1238
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:29,120
So that's helping,
but, yeah, I mean,

1239
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,156
I guess we're still gonna
end up with looking like

1240
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:35,826
at least another week or two
of game play bugs.

1241
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,762
There's just also this
unknown question of, like,

1242
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:39,330
is there a big bug
that we're missing

1243
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,765
that we don't know about?

1244
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:44,268
I think that Tim is
a little bit worried about,

1245
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,404
like, our patching solution
on the disc, too,

1246
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:51,609
and even if that's, like, um,
gonna be well met by customers.

1247
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:52,710
Yeah, I guess the question
is whether

1248
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,278
we are gonna be okay with

1249
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,814
now rolling out
to all of our partners

1250
00:46:56,814 --> 00:47:02,086
and potentially having to
move it back a week or two.

1251
00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:04,121
Bailey: Yeah, I mean,
that's problematic.

1252
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:07,858
We--it's in our best interests to
stick to the April 28th date.

1253
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:10,494
Rice: Mm-hm.
Bailey: So, um,

1254
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:14,031
it's just there's not a
whole lot of wiggle room left.

1255
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:16,100
Rice: Yeah.
Hansen: Yeah, he's trying to--

1256
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,370
he's trying to lay out
the whole thing to Justin.

1257
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:20,538
I mean, honestly,
what we've got to do

1258
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:23,708
is present options for Justin.

1259
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:25,676
You know, there's pros and
cons for each one of them, right?

1260
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,879
And it's--we need to make
a business decision on this.

1261
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,548
Bailey: Because it's a double hit
for us to, like,

1262
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:35,319
take on more expense for
Broken Age to go a week longer.

1263
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:36,620
But then also not
to have the money

1264
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,255
that's being brought in, so...

1265
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:41,092
Hansen: You know, Tim's
already made his decision,

1266
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:43,694
but, you know, Justin needs
to weigh in on it also

1267
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,263
because there's a lot
at stake for this, so...

1268
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,466
There's ramifications
of all these decisions,

1269
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:51,102
but, I mean, we want to push
for the one that's gonna give

1270
00:47:51,102 --> 00:47:53,170
the highest quality game
at the end.

1271
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,406
Rice: Yeah, the question is
whether we can maybe just

1272
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:59,110
push the date back of starting
burning all of those discs

1273
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,745
and still make the 28th,

1274
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:03,013
because the rest of it
actually looks like

1275
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:05,483
it's kinda on track for the 28th

1276
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:10,154
as far as digital release across
all of our other platforms.

1277
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:13,090
So I don't think that really
affects the digital dates.

1278
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:16,026
Hansen: One week of bug fixing
and then one week of--

1279
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:17,394
you know, nobody's
touching the build.

1280
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,796
Rice: Yeah, exactly.
Hansen: It's just in QA.

1281
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:21,599
Rice: If we can go to them and
see if they can move their date

1282
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,435
for manufacturing back
and not touch the final date,

1283
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:26,003
then that seems like
it should be good.

1284
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:28,038
Bailey: Okay. I mean hearing this,

1285
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:28,873
you know, you're probably right.

1286
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:31,008
Let's just go ahead and, um...

1287
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:32,777
I think it'd be good to maybe
just even get a call

1288
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:36,614
and just get all the major
stakeholders on the line at once

1289
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:39,150
and then we can talk about
what the date's looking like

1290
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,484
and then talk about some stuff

1291
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:43,854
that we can give as well
and figure it out.

1292
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:45,756
Hansen: I almost don't want to, like--
the way we phrase this

1293
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,758
is kind of important
'cause we don't want to, like,

1294
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,794
ask them as much as like,
we have to do this.

1295
00:48:49,794 --> 00:48:51,695
I don't see an alternative, so.
Bailey: We're just telling them.

1296
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:52,730
Hansen: About getting them onboard.
Bailey: We're like, "Hey,

1297
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,598
we're in the production,
you know,

1298
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,133
so we're definitely not
gonna make the five weeks

1299
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,735
that's, you know,
ideal for you guys.

1300
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:58,736
Hansen: Yeah.

1301
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:13,960
[Music]

1302
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:16,520
Um, so I guess
we can start any time,

1303
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,322
uh, any time you want.

1304
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:20,825
Bailey: Um, are you guys okay--
we have our camera crew.

1305
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:22,827
They want to film this
for the documentary.

1306
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:26,197
So are you guys okay
with being on camera,

1307
00:49:26,197 --> 00:49:28,799
or your voices being on tape?

1308
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,434
Nordic Rep: Sure.

1309
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:35,406
Bailey: The bad news is that
we had about a five week, um...

1310
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:37,475
On your production schedule,
it had five weeks out

1311
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:39,310
when we actually gave you guys the build,

1312
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,845
like, for us to actually
get the build to you,

1313
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:44,682
and for you then to be able
to get this pressed.

1314
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:47,451
So with the bugs
and other things

1315
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:50,221
we're running up against
now, it looks like--

1316
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:51,856
I don't know if we're
gonna need to go

1317
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:53,324
right up against that deadline,

1318
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,392
but we're gonna need more time

1319
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:57,495
than the five weeks
we planned for

1320
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,763
in that schedule
you guys sent over.

1321
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:01,765
Rice: I think the date
we know we'd be confident

1322
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:04,235
at having a stable build
ready for you to press disc

1323
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:06,070
is April third.

1324
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:08,105
So, yeah, I guess that's
where the question comes in is

1325
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:10,441
if there's a little bit more
wiggle room on your guys' side

1326
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:15,212
to try and push back that
disc pressing date a little bit.

1327
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,814
Nordic Rep: So you're saying
April third would be ready

1328
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,382
to replicate, right?

1329
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:19,650
Rice: Yeah.

1330
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:24,688
Nordic Rep: Well, I mean,
that would give us enough time

1331
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:28,759
for an April 28th release.

1332
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:29,793
Bailey: Good.
Rice: Cool.

1333
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:31,795
That's what we were hoping.

1334
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,397
Bailey: Yay.
All right.

1335
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:34,632
Rice: Okay. So, yeah, I guess
we just didn't know

1336
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:35,766
if there was, like, buffer

1337
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:39,470
built into that schedule or not.

1338
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:43,374
Nordic Rep: I mean, it's tight, you know.

1339
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:46,043
Rice: Sounds great.
Hansen: That'd be awesome.

1340
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,244
Nordic Rep: But let me--you know,
if we can--you know,

1341
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,646
if that's a reliable date,

1342
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:51,348
if April 3 is reliable,
you know,

1343
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:53,017
then I'm cool with it, you know.

1344
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:56,787
If we actually do have a
master going into replication

1345
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,756
on April 4,

1346
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,824
you know, that works for us.

1347
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:01,859
-Okay.
-But there's no--

1348
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:02,826
I mean there's absolutely

1349
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:04,795
no buffer in there anymore.

1350
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,264
Rice: That's what we figured,
but that sounds great.

1351
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:10,000
I mean, I think the team's gonna
be excited about that for sure.

1352
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,702
Bailey: And having you guys in
here as well, you know,

1353
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:13,704
this could be probably
the biggest launch

1354
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,706
I think Double Fine's ever done.

1355
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:17,875
Nordic Rep: Very good.
Bailey: Yeah.

1356
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:18,809
Exciting time.

1357
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,878
Rice: So April 28th.

1358
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:22,513
Hansen: Yep, April 28th.

1359
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:23,881
Bailey: Awesome.
Nordic Rep: All right.

1360
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:25,516
Hansen: Yeah, yeah, it's--
we would--

1361
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:28,252
basically it would be
pencils down on the 27th.

1362
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:29,286
Rice: Cool.
Hansen: And then we'd just--

1363
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:30,754
it just cooks in QA after that.

1364
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,223
Rice: Right.
Hansen: That should be really good.

1365
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:35,826
We'll have a really solid
build at that point.

1366
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:38,095
Rice: Cool. I mean, it seems
like best case scenario.

1367
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:41,098
I didn't think they were
gonna be so easy to move.

1368
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,700
It's 'cause they had that
buffer, waiting.

1369
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,301
Bailey: I think the camera helped.

1370
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,136
The camera probably did help.

1371
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:48,806
Bailey: Thanks, 2 Player!
Hansen: Yeah.

1372
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:50,507
Schafer: Okay.

1373
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:53,444
So I heard that I could
add a character.

1374
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,546
Yeah, okay. No, that's awesome.

1375
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:57,881
Hansen: Maybe....two characters?
Schafer: That's really good news.

1376
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,751
I did not want to go into this
knowing that we'd have to ship

1377
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:04,555
depending on a day one patch
for basic stability.

1378
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:06,991
So that's much better.
That's awesome. Thank you.

1379
00:52:06,991 --> 00:52:08,993
Hansen: So this week's really important.
So we need to make sure the team

1380
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:11,795
remains focused and we are
reviewing the bugs constantly.

1381
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,797
Rice: Sweet.

1382
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:14,798
Cool, and Nordic's gonna be

1383
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:15,766
putting testers on it, too,

1384
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:17,434
looking at German.

1385
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:19,269
Perfect.
Coull: So, um, yeah.

1386
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,271
Rice: Awesome.
Sounds good.

1387
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:23,440
Almost there, man.
Almost there.

1388
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:26,777
-I know.

1389
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,416
Hopefully everyone
will make one more week...

1390
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:33,617
-...and we'll be, uh...
-All right.

1391
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:36,754
She's in.
She's in right now.

1392
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:37,788
Yeah, she just got here.

1393
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:38,789
We should go talk to her.

1394
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,026
Hi Anna.
Kipnis: Hi.

1395
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:43,260
Rice: Are you feeling better?

1396
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,628
Kipnis: A little bit.

1397
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:45,729
Rice: But they could turn around

1398
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,364
in three weeks they said, so --

1399
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:49,299
If it got to where we had
to move it to the third,

1400
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,434
we probably could.

1401
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:52,569
Yeah.

1402
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:54,605
Kipnis: Well...

1403
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:56,106
Rice: Well, I'm glad
you're feeling better.

1404
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:57,141
Kipnis: Yeah.

1405
00:52:57,141 --> 00:52:58,742
That was the worst week

1406
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:00,177
to have missed of work.

1407
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,646
I mean, of all the times
to get sick.

1408
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:06,884
I would get emails every once
in a while where I was like, fuck.

1409
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,719
Well, I felt like I was
letting the team down,

1410
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:11,789
but that the game wasn't
gonna go in the toilet

1411
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:14,258
or anything
while I was out so...

1412
00:53:14,258 --> 00:53:17,194
Yeah, I mean, it's nice to
really trust your colleagues.

1413
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,329
That's a good feeling
that they actually, like,

1414
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,265
took the time to do it
and stuff.

1415
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:24,835
That's, I don't know,
that's great, too, so.

1416
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:26,837
Hey, I'm still not a
hundred percent right now,

1417
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:30,340
but, um, I--I feel confident

1418
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,810
that we'll--
you know, we'll make it,

1419
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:35,846
especially with the little bit
of extra time that we got.

1420
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:38,048
Rice: Sounds good.

1421
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,283
Crook: Okay.
Rice: Good plan.

1422
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:50,060
Boop, boop, boop.

1423
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:55,065
Yay!

1424
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:33,380
[Music]

1425
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:39,143
Crook: Yeah. Yeah, I'm just
excited to be done, uh, soon.

1426
00:54:39,143 --> 00:54:41,345
Three years.

1427
00:54:41,345 --> 00:54:42,746
Kipnis: Yeah, it, uh, it's great.

1428
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,481
It feels weird.

1429
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,416
It feels weird
that it's almost done.

1430
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,885
It's the strangest thing.

1431
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:49,419
Franzke: Yeah, it is kind of weird.

1432
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,388
It's kind of weird to--

1433
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,624
Well, it's kind of weird
that it took three years.

1434
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,792
I don't think--I don't think
we kind of thought

1435
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,394
in the beginning
it would take that long.

1436
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:25,560
[Music]

1437
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,628
Schafer: Well, you know, three years
is not that long for a game.

1438
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,798
People will laugh at that,
but Brutal was four years.

1439
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:38,435
Grim-- I mean Psychonauts
was five years.

1440
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:41,238
Grim was three years, so it's
the same amount of time as Grim

1441
00:55:41,238 --> 00:55:45,442
with a smaller team
and less crunch mode.

1442
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:46,777
Grim was really, like,
six years if you count

1443
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:49,613
all the evenings that we worked.

1444
00:55:49,613 --> 00:55:53,016
Um, but it's weird--it's weird
to look at the old episodes

1445
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,752
and just think about how
long we've been working on this

1446
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,788
and how different it felt
in the beginning.

1447
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:09,080
[Music]

1448
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,868
Look, Broken Age alumni.

1449
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,303
We're wrapping it up. We're
remembering the old people

1450
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:14,538
like Levi.

1451
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:15,706
Ryken: Hi, everybody.

1452
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,541
Rice: We miss you.

1453
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:20,143
Schafer: Hello, everybody.
Can you remind us, Greg, where we are,

1454
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,879
what's the schedule,
and what will be happening now?

1455
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:23,747
Rice: So the next thing is
locking down the build,

1456
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,550
which is happening
at the end of the week.

1457
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:31,288
Franzke: So really, it's not actually
all that super glamorous,

1458
00:56:31,288 --> 00:56:34,858
but essentially what you
can see is all these files here

1459
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:37,661
that have the exclamation mark on it.

1460
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:40,831
And what that means is that
these files are different

1461
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:45,669
from the version of the file
that's already in that branch.

1462
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:47,371
So that's the release
candidate branch

1463
00:56:47,371 --> 00:56:51,074
and so I just say accept
this and it will say okay.

1464
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,377
That means I will
overwrite all your files

1465
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:54,878
that you have right now

1466
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:57,848
and then just let Perforce
do its thing.

1467
00:56:57,848 --> 00:57:00,584
Have the little guy walking,
which is still my favorite--

1468
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:03,720
one of my favorite icons
in terms of tools.

1469
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:09,026
This is really
a lot of programming,

1470
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:11,194
and especially
release engineering

1471
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:14,264
is just sitting around
waiting for files to be copied

1472
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:18,802
and for certain operations
to be performed on files,

1473
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:21,171
which is just kind of weird,
like one would expect that,

1474
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,406
you know, shipping a game
is, like,

1475
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:24,808
super exciting kind of stuff.

1476
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:26,276
But really, in the end of a day,

1477
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,278
it's a lot of copying files
from A to B

1478
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:32,015
and sitting around waiting
for those files to be copied.

1479
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:36,420
Um, all right.
So now we essentially have,

1480
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,822
like, all the yellow
exclamation marks are gone,

1481
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:41,058
which means we now
have a list of files,

1482
00:57:41,058 --> 00:57:43,727
all the files that were changed.

1483
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:45,429
And I'm just gonna say, okay,

1484
00:57:45,429 --> 00:57:47,597
I want to commit these
into the release kind of branch,

1485
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:51,134
so I'm gonna say
integration from main.

1486
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,736
And this is actually
also lock down,

1487
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:55,505
so I'm gonna say
content lock.

1488
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:58,075
Oh, I actually have
to spell it correctly.

1489
00:57:58,075 --> 00:58:02,679
And then I say submit,
and that's essentially it.

1490
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:05,849
So now we grab all the files
from the main line

1491
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:09,219
and copy them over into
the release candidate branch,

1492
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,788
and we lock down the build.

1493
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:14,324
Rice: Right now all the, uh,
disc stuff is basically

1494
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,059
off to Nordic
and on their plate,

1495
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,195
so that should actually go
into manufacturing this week.

1496
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:19,363
And they said they said
they're gonna talk

1497
00:58:19,363 --> 00:58:20,831
with us for photos

1498
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,866
and gonna update
as they go along.

1499
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:24,735
But this should be
