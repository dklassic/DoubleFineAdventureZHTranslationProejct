1
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,615
Stamos: Just even taking like what's the
new schedule out of it for a second,

2
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:31,379
it's like can we finish the game for, 
you know, the remaining amount of money?

3
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,627
Because I think we're in a situation

4
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:38,827
where we need to significantly increase 
our funding for this game.

5
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:42,067
Or significantly reduce
the scope of the game.

6
00:00:42,838 --> 00:01:07,738
[Music]

7
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,380
Rice: OK.

8
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,936
Stamos: That said, really talking about 
the overall schedule.

9
00:01:15,936 --> 00:01:19,696
Right now the overall schedule for 
Red's is posted as April.

10
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:24,604
And I think there's a sense 
from the team that

11
00:01:24,604 --> 00:01:28,124
that's not actually
a feasible timeframe.

12
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,938
Min: I think, I think just the larger goal
is when, like hey, when's our Alpha?

13
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,639
What's that mean?

14
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,322
When's our Beta?

15
00:01:36,322 --> 00:01:37,395
When do we ship?

16
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,940
When's that, our big trailer coming.

17
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,260
Those are sort of like,
like the few hi level stuff

18
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,041
that I like to kind of get an idea of.

19
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,779
When are the ports coming online?

20
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,960
So it does worry me, because that 
does make a big difference

21
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,740
in terms of what to do now.

22
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,819
Crook: And for me, like dates and things,
 just working here for this long...

23
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:02,680
I've just gotten used to things
change and so I don't freak out.

24
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,220
And I think, you know, there were
times where it was, yeah,

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,120
we've had people freak out and like
leave because they freaked out.

26
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:16,880
And so I kind of learned that,
you just sort of, we'll figure it out.

27
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,120
Stamos: Not enough of work
has been done for the team

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,760
to have confidence that
they're really halfway through.

29
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,200
Stamos: And I think there's
a lot of work to do still,

30
00:02:28,205 --> 00:02:31,052
to understand really what the scope is,

31
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,500
but it's coming into,
it's coming into view.

32
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:38,571
I think it's expanded a lot from 
what they originally thought.

33
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:47,754
And when projects evolve like that, 
you need to really reevaluate the plans.

34
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:52,851
So having a clear plan in place that 
you can iterate on is a good start.

35
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:57,726
So I want to get like the tools in place
and help Greg get the tools in place

36
00:02:57,726 --> 00:03:01,533
to have that, so that there's 
a plan that he can easily iterate on.

37
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,673
So that's mostly what I'm helping with.

38
00:03:03,981 --> 00:03:06,645
Stamos: Job number one is to make 
this game awesome,

39
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:10,865
because it's just too important 
to do anything else.

40
00:03:11,363 --> 00:03:16,123
First steps first is to figure out 
at least where we're landing.

41
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,460
And so that's not pick a date 
and work back from that.

42
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,969
It is more of a bottoms-up.

43
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:27,770
Let's map out everything 
that we know about the game

44
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,446
and then really see
how long it will take.

45
00:03:30,446 --> 00:03:33,180
Schafer: Like can we do that before 
this milestone is over or after?

46
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:35,189
'Cause what we'll find out in this 
milestone is if we can bring,

47
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:41,560
if we can bring, Cloud Colony to Alpha 
to Beta that'll mean something.

48
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,216
Not the end of all our problems, 
but it'll mean something.

49
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:48,958
If we can't bring it to Beta, that'll be
even more informative in a way.

50
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,318
Schafer: But I never believe
that we're going to be late,

51
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,160
but I've been late before,
a couple times.

52
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,120
Three or four. Every time,
most of the times.

53
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,302
So we really want to prove that we can 
get the Cloud Colony done this month

54
00:03:59,302 --> 00:04:02,261
so we can prove that we're,
we're picking up the pace

55
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:04,481
and we're, you know,
we can finish stuff.

56
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:06,656
Schafer: It's great. I mean this is what
I've been waiting for,

57
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,604
it's been really frustrating to 
be in the writing cave

58
00:04:09,604 --> 00:04:11,247
and the designing cave for a long time.

59
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:16,456
'Cause it's like work's being done on the
game and I'm not participating in it.

60
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,439
and now I'm getting much more,
being much more participatory.

61
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:26,923
And I feel like, I feel like I'm able to
point at what needs to get done

62
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:29,283
and push on it to get it done more.

63
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,463
Schafer: There's two things 
like for me, now the first one

64
00:04:32,463 --> 00:04:36,139
was pretty much the same as this is, 
but it's just like harder to list out.

65
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,793
Things that I'm looking
to find answers for.

66
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,780
'Cause I want find answers to almost
everything, like is the game working?

67
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,848
Is the game right?

68
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,403
Is it, like you have
this feeling after the sprint

69
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:46,968
and like that's exactly what 
the game's going to look like,

70
00:04:47,383 --> 00:04:50,223
but as far, as close as we can except
for the things that are obviously we can't.

71
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:50,848
That's the first one.

72
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:52,119
The second one sounds like,

73
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,511
it sounds like a disagreement 
but it's not a disagreement.

74
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,400
It's really just working at
it from the other end.

75
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,337
It's that I really want the
Cloud Colony be done.

76
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,354
I mean like done with the Cloud Colony,

77
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,801
'cause we've been
working on it for long time

78
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,309
and we have a lot of
other areas to get to.

79
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:05,871
And so I want to have it be, 
as much as possible,

80
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,834
have the approach of like we're
not coming back to the Cloud Colony.

81
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,441
I want to be approaching it like we're finishing
off in terms of Beta, you know.

82
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:15,193
Schafer: So we're going to go, 
actually go through the game play

83
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,160
and make sure we itemize 
all the things that need to be done.

84
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,420
Franzke: That's the idea.

85
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,763
All right.

86
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:22,577
And you were, Greg is
the official note taker.

87
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,740
Rice: Yes.  Schafer: OK.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,852
So I'm trying to solve a puzzle.

89
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,518
I'm trying to make Jessie like me.

90
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:30,240
Jessie doesn't like me.

91
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,580
So when you go over here and you interact
with Jessie, where the hell did I go?

92
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,360
There, what's that?

93
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,100
What was that?

94
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,500
Kipnis: That's if you click off the 
nav mesh or something like that.

95
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,180
Like that, that happens.

96
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,220
Schafer: Her turning
animation's a little much.

97
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,240
Kipnis: It's a little much?
Do you want it to be shorter?

98
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,191
Schafer: Well, it makes it really unresponsive
that she has to do that turn.

99
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,120
You kind of want her to
just move right away.

100
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,264
Rice: Play-throughs are awesome, yeah.

101
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:56,256
'Cause it gets everybody in the same room
together looking at it at the same time.

102
00:05:56,739 --> 00:06:00,239
It like nails Tim down to where 
like he has to like sit there

103
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,561
and play it with everybody 
in a room and get directly like,

104
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:05,452
point out the things that
he's not happy with.

105
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,351
Because I mean, he plays it a lot 
and he'll send the email feedback

106
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,598
and he'll bring things up 
in stand-ups and stuff.

107
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,700
But it's nice to just be able to

108
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,787
sit there and like everybody see 
it on the screen together

109
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:20,727
and like know the things that he 
is not happy with and that need work.

110
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,950
Schafer: So first I have
to solve that puzzle.

111
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,590
So I come back here and I'm like...

112
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,980
[Groans]

113
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,920
Schafer: So task for Oliver, 
make that crash optional.

114
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,940
Franzke: All right.
Optional crash system.

115
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,223
The game has encountered a problem.

116
00:06:36,223 --> 00:06:37,423
Do you want to crash now?

117
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:41,323
No. All right. Game is recovered.

118
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,840
[Music]

119
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,000
Schafer: One of the hard things
about making an adventure game

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,940
is that the team doesn't often find 
the game fun when they're working on it.

121
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,181
It's not like a first person shooter

122
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:58,052
where even if you're working on
a first person shooter, it's fun to play it.

123
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,561
But an adventure game, you know 
all the solutions,

124
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:01,221
all the puzzles and
you know all the jokes.

125
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:05,021
So there's no like discovery or
you know, you know, wonder or...

126
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:06,233
It's fun to see it come together

127
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,347
and it's fun to see that you're 
making something good.

128
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,775
But you don't stay late.

129
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,440
No one's going to stay late to like 
play Red's after, after hours.

130
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,480
Hey, you want to play Red's?

131
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,600
Yeah, let's do it.

132
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,420
Let's hook it up.

133
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,562
'Cause like, oh, yeah, I know.

134
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,182
This is the puzzle I wired up.

135
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,004
So and that's always been sad.

136
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,319
Schafer: OK. I'm trying to remember 
how to actually make games.

137
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,420
I'm trying to program.

138
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,460
First let me get all the latest stuff.

139
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,160
It's syncing up.

140
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,500
Now I'm going to run the game.

141
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,600
Never actually done this before.

142
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,560
This is gonna be embarrassing.

143
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,180
We should film the
second time I do this.

144
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,400
'Cause the second time I'll be like

145
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,660
[makes computer noises]

146
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,200
oh, this is Unix.  I know this.

147
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,300
[computer noises]

148
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,844
Offscreen Voice: Is that Jurassic Park?

149
00:07:52,844 --> 00:07:54,216
Schafer: That Jurassic Park joke.

150
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,228
Is that getting too old to
make that reference?

151
00:07:56,228 --> 00:08:00,023
I'm hoping I can actually just enter
dialogue myself into the engine.

152
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,940
'Cause you know, when you, you know,

153
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,080
for a long time from Psychonauts
and Brutal Legend stuff,

154
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,365
I'd write dialogue and then someone
like Anna or Kee

155
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:09,845
or someone would have to
come and implement it.

156
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,693
But then you don't get
to really like tweak it.

157
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,913
Like I like to put stuff in and then 
see how the timing works out

158
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,620
and then mess with it.

159
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,260
And also it'd be nice while 
I was writing if I didn't think

160
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,520
I was just creating a whole bunch 
of work for someone else to do.

161
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,800
It'd be great if I could,

162
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,479
if I'm going to put it into Excel or 
if I'm going to put it into a database,

163
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,180
I might as well just
put it into the game.

164
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,540
And then I'm not creating
work for, you know,

165
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,458
that way Anna can work on
something else and I can just do this.

166
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,471
And also at my age I really would 
like to learn something

167
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,860
so I don't have Alzheimer's.

168
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,959
But I think it's too late.

169
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,464
I think I have it 'cause I can't 
figure out at all what's happening.

170
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,420
How do I open this scene?

171
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,560
How do I open?

172
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,840
Open in project?

173
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,500
That's a bunch of things.

174
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,680
Can you believe I have a CS degree?

175
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,020
Class of '89.

176
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,100
Voice.

177
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,773
X vertical

178
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,840
Font.

179
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,140
Where's the dialogue?

180
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,420
Where's your dialogue?

181
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,634
I'm going to go ask her really quick.

182
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,020
I'll be right back.

183
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,300
Schafer: And then I'll totally be able
to program this entire game myself.

184
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,680
I got it.

185
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,160
I totally had it all figured out.

186
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,700
Wait...

187
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,780
This looks totally different 
than on her computer.

188
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,380
Why did she set me up like this?

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,400
She totally lied to me.

190
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,740
I'm going to have to go back there
and ask her again.

191
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,600
Ugh.

192
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,340
Schafer: Like in theory, me being able
to program my own dialogue

193
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,020
in the game would save time.

194
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,420
It's not there quite yet.

195
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:57,805
See, I'm taking up Anna's time 
but it's going to save her time later,

196
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,320
when I can program the
entire game myself.

197
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,180
Let's see if I remember anything 
that Anna showed me.

198
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,860
I don't remember anything 
that Anna showed me.

199
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,117
It's annoying because I did touch stuff

200
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,100
and now I don't know
if I touched something.

201
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,000
I pretty much reverted
everything I touched.

202
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,520
Schafer: So embarrassing.

203
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,120
Schafer: I got it. I'm in.

204
00:10:20,014 --> 00:10:21,215
I've hacked the mainframe.

205
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:26,595
I'm totally, I'm seeing all the beauty 
that is Red's simultaneously at once.

206
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,600
Well, that's a day's work. Done.

207
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:36,269
Schafer: But there's this pressure to, 
we got to meet the milestone.

208
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,429
I just got to get all this writing done.

209
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,549
I can't be messing around
with like this stuff.

210
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:43,376
So I changed gears and just 
focus on getting all the dialogue done

211
00:10:43,998 --> 00:10:46,738
and it means that Anna has to 
spend a lot of time implementing it,

212
00:10:49,144 --> 00:10:53,724
but the question is will there be a point
where I can actually, you know,

213
00:10:54,168 --> 00:10:57,988
get up and running enough on the
 programming to make that efficient?

214
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,020
I don't know.

215
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,280
Kipnis: There's just a lot more 
content, I think, in these,

216
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,820
in Cloud Colony than there has been 
in the other stuff that we've had.

217
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,460
And it's a lot of work 
to get it all implemented.

218
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:17,019
Crook: I don't know. It'll be all right.

219
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,428
It'll be OK. It's always this way.

220
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,985
Ryken: It's, I think back the first game
that I worked on was Brutal Legend

221
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:30,485
and that was, that was my concept for what,
you know, games are like, you know.

222
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:33,485
And in this one it's like, it's not going to
take four and a half years?

223
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,880
Sounds like a good game for me.

224
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,054
But yeah, there's a lot of iteration in
the beginning and then you find,

225
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:43,694
you get closer to the spirit of the game

226
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,670
and I feel like when the game 
starts gelling together,

227
00:11:48,953 --> 00:11:52,433
kind of like the way just recently 
the girl got a shadow.

228
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,184
And I was like happier
than high hell that

229
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,960
Just the smallest little thing 
goes into the game and it,

230
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,644
it's no longer just this, this animated
stick figure walking around.

231
00:12:04,644 --> 00:12:08,624
It's gelling it together and it
gets exciting, it gets exciting

232
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:11,972
because like those things are 
going to be there as we're carving out

233
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,400
those little connectors to the world 
that you're walking in, you know.

234
00:12:17,307 --> 00:12:20,167
They're going to be there when 
we start on new areas already

235
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:23,127
and you're going to have a feel 
for walking through the spaces

236
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,720
and it's really cool.

237
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,805
Schafer: Look at that sinking!

238
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:26,969
That's awesome.

239
00:12:26,969 --> 00:12:28,045
I can't save her!

240
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:29,816
I can't save her,
I can't save her! Get up!

241
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,720
Oh my God, I've had this dream.

242
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,407
Schafer: No, I get more excited
about this game every day

243
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:34,113
because as it starts to come together,

244
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,620
because we started from just scratch,

245
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,298
it's cool to actually see
it become real, you know.

246
00:12:39,538 --> 00:12:42,538
Because of the framerate I can't
click anywhere

247
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,694
Schafer: But I think the game
is looking a lot better,

248
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,914
the characters are really pretty.

249
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,340
The backgrounds are getting
better and better looking.

250
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,401
And you know, we're starting
to see the basic interface working now.

251
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,685
And with music in, you know,

252
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:57,425
it's starting to really feel like 
a real adventure game.

253
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,680
Ryken: And I was just doing 
the 
flat paint over on the art

254
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,860
that we had that Lee did, sent out.

255
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,553
Schafer: All right, everybody.

256
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,500
Let us break.

257
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,680
And let us do this again next week.

258
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,301
Stapley: So yesterday I was just 
sort of going through

259
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:17,433
and painting a bunch
of the scenes files.

260
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,684
And now I'm just addressing all that feedback
from the walk-through, play-through.

261
00:13:22,684 --> 00:13:24,669
Ryken: Yesterday I was 
drawing hands for the girl

262
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:26,730
and then I got sick of 
drawing hands for the girl.

263
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,950
So I stopped drawing hands for the girl.

264
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,440
Hands are the worst!

265
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,254
Why does anybody want to do hands?

266
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,460
Petty: So now she has hooks?

267
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,826
Ryken: Yeah. She's
always going like this.

268
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,840
Fietzek: And yesterday I did some last
final changes on the forum post,

269
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,180
which is online now.

270
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,940
So also, this is my last stand-up,
which is so sad.

271
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,860
And yeah. You know, like I, yeah,
I want to say a tiny bit.

272
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:03,569
I'm not so good at this, but just
a big thank you to all of you guys.

273
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:06,549
It's been an amazing three months.

274
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,020
You guys are all amazing
and amazing people.

275
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:20,560
I'm so thankful for that internship
and I did a group picture of us.

276
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,040
Kipnis: Awww!

277
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,040
Franzke: That's awesome.

278
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,320
[Laughter]

279
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,740
Everyone on the team,
including you guys.

280
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,940
Kipnis: Aww dude, thanks a lot.
Bagel: Lets just scan that in.

281
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,400
Fietzek: I'll send it around.

282
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,300
Kipnis: Should we make it poster size?

283
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,320
Fietzek: It should be big enough.

284
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,160
Petty: Thank you, Marius.

285
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,255
Thank you for all your hard work here.

286
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,940
It's been awesome having you here.

287
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,299
[Applause]

288
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,560
Schafer: I thought we might be able 
to convince Marius to stay

289
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,570
because we would have had to just
derail his education as I said,

290
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,510
but there was, I was 
not expecting the real reason

291
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,426
he was going back to Germany, 
which was for love.

292
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,440
And though we are 
evil enough to end education,

293
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,940
we could not fight
the force that is love.

294
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,540
Schafer: We were trying to set up a 
contract where he could keep doing

295
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,785
what he's doing from Germany, 
making animatics for us.

296
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:20,280
It's kind of like when Scott Campbell 
and Nathan moved to New York.

297
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,034
I would just try and keep 
those guys working for us

298
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,851
because I, you don't, you know, people,
 people who are talented people

299
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,960
don't come around every day and you got
 to like hang onto them when you can.

300
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,480
Marius: Yeah. I can try
coming back next year.

301
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:51,840
[Music]

302
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,540
Schafer: I feel like now we're actually
moving at the speed that we're moving at.

303
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,782
As soon as they get all 
locked down with the process

304
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:01,082
between Bagel and Levi and Lee,

305
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:04,784
I think it'll be, feel like 
we're moving at a good clip.

306
00:16:05,258 --> 00:16:07,634
Offscreen Voice: So you're back?

307
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,934
Stapley: I'm back in action. Red's.

308
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,780
No way man.

309
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,740
Tim should wear my hat.

310
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:26,420
[Music]

311
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,425
Stapley: I'd like to actually get involved
more with like concept stuff, though.

312
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:33,265
Yeah, I feel like I'm
just kind of a painter.

313
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,360
Petty: Well, you and I
talked about that, right?

314
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,927
And you said you,
Stapley: Yeah, yeah, but like...

315
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:38,547
Petty: you wanted to do,
Stapley: the way it's turning with,

316
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:44,626
because all the designs are approved,
so it's basically like, it's approved.

317
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,820
You know what I mean?

318
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,211
Petty: Individuals have changed
what they wanted to do.

319
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:51,465
You know, initially Bagel did
want to do a lot of painting.

320
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:54,774
And I think as we started getting into that,
he felt like hey, you know,

321
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:59,840
I really want to be more on the compositional
side, which is fine, you know.

322
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,360
But that means we're going to have
to shift things around.

323
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,500
Petty: Do you think this process is 
going to make that better?

324
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,095
Stapley: Which process?

325
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,299
Petty: Whatever, we're sort of 
being non-specific...

326
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,900
Stapley: I think having more hands
painting and oh, well, I don't know.

327
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,260
I think I would feel, well,

328
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,359
at least if we're going to say 
like this is Bagel's style of game,

329
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:24,160
then I would, yeah, at least I would have
a little bit more like yeah, you know,

330
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:25,541
that is my stuff.

331
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,360
Stapley: Like this sacrifice scene.

332
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,860
This is actually, I did the layout 
in this one and the camera angles.

333
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,689
And I feel good how that went.

334
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,449
Offscreen Voice: It's more Bagel.

335
00:17:35,449 --> 00:17:37,789
Stapley: Yeah, I feel, yeah,
like this is maybe more Bagel.

336
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,380
A little bit.

337
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,160
Petty: Click down, like just 
double click towards the bottom

338
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,480
so she walks down there.

339
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,380
Schafer: What the? Whoa..!

340
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,180
Schafer: Yeah, I like the, the first
tested out was the sacrifice area,

341
00:17:51,182 --> 00:17:52,762
the new method.

342
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:53,905
And I really liked that.

343
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:56,405
It's pretty and I like that whole setup.

344
00:17:56,405 --> 00:18:00,205
I like the crazy big bird cages that
are moved and ripped open

345
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,400
and I think those are cool.

346
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,945
So it's promising.

347
00:18:02,945 --> 00:18:04,157
Stapley: Yeah. So now it's just,

348
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,600
I guess there's just a question of like
talking to Levi and Lee this week

349
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,360
and figuring out the paint, how to
make it look consistent, you know.

350
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,280
That's, I think, the big
major thing right now.

351
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,300
All right, you know, that's the thing,
a worrisome thing that we should work on.

352
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:25,866
Petty: So this is the
very old one, right?

353
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:27,266
Based on the color key.

354
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:30,128
So, I painted this one entirely
with a charcoal brush,

355
00:18:30,128 --> 00:18:32,745
'cause when we started I thought
that's what we're doing on that one.

356
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:36,068
So it's, I think it's,
it's a little too linear.

357
00:18:36,068 --> 00:18:38,472
It's too charcoal-y and
colors are all wrong.

358
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,332
Petty: It's been difficult.

359
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,005
It's weird, it's weird finding out
which area, why it's been difficult.

360
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,040
Part of it has been has been,
he's evolving his own approach,

361
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,840
to like the clouds specifically
is very different than

362
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,602
sort of what painted the lumberjack.

363
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:54,662
So as his approach has been evolving,
I've been trying to like paint this way

364
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:56,334
and we've been changing
it back and forth.

365
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,558
Petty: I kind of feel I knew the way
we should try handling this one is,

366
00:18:59,936 --> 00:19:01,858
if you, say take this scene

367
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:05,558
and do like a line drawing composition
and then do like a little small color key.

368
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,260
And then we give it to Levi and 
have him try and paint it.

369
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,085
Ryken: I feel like we wouldn't need 
that much of a color key,

370
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:16,061
considering we were coming from 
an establishing shot already.

371
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,032
Petty: We've been doing other things 
as well, as like, you know,

372
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:21,312
I have brush sets that I made 
basing on he likes to use in Photoshop

373
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,640
and we're kind of updating those.

374
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,480
So those can be given to all the
artists that are painting digitally.

375
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,512
It's difficult.

376
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,080
I mean, I think one of the reasons why

377
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,362
it made sense to have him paint stuff 
on the back end is it was,

378
00:19:34,362 --> 00:19:35,387
it would have been,

379
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:37,027
he'd be the last person
touching each asset.

380
00:19:37,027 --> 00:19:40,427
So it's necessarily just going to be
more unified stylistically.

381
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:44,965
But by moving him to the front,
it creates more, it probably gives

382
00:19:44,965 --> 00:19:49,322
the overall sense of things a little more
quirkiness that he would have.

383
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:52,842
But it means we have more potential
like consistency drifting going on,

384
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:54,002
on the backside.

385
00:19:55,175 --> 00:19:58,535
But yeah, I think it's been, everything's
been moving pretty well actually.

386
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,901
I'd say we made lots of really
good progress this sprint.

387
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:02,101
Dillon: Like I'm actually
really happy with

388
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,981
the progress that we made
in terms of this stuff.

389
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,080
We got a bunch of big features in
and the tool's a lot better, kind of stuff.

390
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,200
Rice: Just the little things, too, just like
the cameras feel so much better.

391
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,412
Just navigating around
is way better now.

392
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,520
Dillon: It's just one of those things
where it's like, you know,

393
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,060
getting a basic system
in there is easy and

394
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,360
giving it enough love so that it
actually feels good is hard.

395
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,420
Like having milestones like this

396
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,320
where we're really focused
on polishing up an area,

397
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,520
is a forcing function for like

398
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,480
we have a camera system but what we
actually need is a good camera system.

399
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
[Laughter]

400
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,540
Rice: Yeah.

401
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,759
Dillon: So I think we may have gotten a lot
of traction in a lot of different areas

402
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,080
and that stuff this time around.

403
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,260
Rice: Cool. Thanks, bro.

404
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,813
Rice: Oh, what? How successful is 
the Cloud Colony stuff gonna be?

405
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,979
Yeah, how close are you going to be 
to it actually being finished .

406
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,340
Rice: Well, I think we'll
have a better idea of that

407
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,700
after I go around and talk to everybody,
 which I'm going to do right now.

408
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,680
Crook: But it's nice.

409
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,460
This is working, which
is really great to have.

410
00:21:04,217 --> 00:21:05,777
So you know, 
Rice: Yeah.

411
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,160
Three weeks ago we
didn't have any cut scenes.

412
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,500
Crook: It's been sort of
stuttering and going, you know,

413
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,917
but that's smoothing out
so we're making progress.

414
00:21:15,412 --> 00:21:17,552
Just not as fast as we would like.

415
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,360
Johnstone: So he's cleaned up. 
Rice: She.

416
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,000
Johnstone: She, she. She's cleaned up.

417
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,400
And I'm really done
in like five minutes.

418
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,387
Rice: Sweet.
Johnstone: Jessie's.

419
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,487
Rice: Awesome. Cool.

420
00:21:30,487 --> 00:21:31,508
Johnstone: So that's where I'm in.

421
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:32,543
That's where I'm at.

422
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:33,503
Rice: Perfect.

423
00:21:33,503 --> 00:21:34,863
Why is raining on your screen?

424
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:39,403
Johnstone: Oh. It's rainy
moods as a soundtrack.

425
00:21:39,408 --> 00:21:40,488
It's nice.

426
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,580
Sometimes it's nice to
listen to ambient noise.

427
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,840
Rice: Cool.

428
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,380
Johnstone: So why not?

429
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,980
Rice: This isn't going as fast
as I was hoping it would.

430
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,960
Miss Kipnis, I'm coming to you.

431
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,045
Kipnis: So I mean, I don't, there's no way
I'm going to get through my entire list,

432
00:21:58,045 --> 00:22:03,484
but I'll get, you know,
I'll get as much as I can.

433
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,330
Rice: Cool. Cool.

434
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,070
Petty: You know, there's not a ton left.

435
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,664
I mean, I'm pretty much on schedule.

436
00:22:08,664 --> 00:22:12,125
I'm running a little behind but 
it's only theoretically behind.

437
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,245
Rice: Sounds good, man. 
Petty: Yeah.

438
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:17,143
Rice: We'll see how the
play-through goes tomorrow.

439
00:22:17,488 --> 00:22:19,768
Schafer: Before we start,
I'm going to guess that,

440
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,120
like our goal was to finish
Cloud Colony this sprint.

441
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:26,426
I have a feeling it's not finished.

442
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,133
Rice: You might be right.

443
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,080
Schafer: Oh man.

444
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,566
I haven't even, we have like 
another two week sprint

445
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:34,066
that it would be great if we could 
finish Cloud Colony in that.

446
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:35,866
I don't want to just keep setting
up the team to fail, though.

447
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:38,066
Like OK you guys, we're going to 
finish Cloud Colony this sprint.

448
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,682
OK, I didn't do it.

449
00:22:39,682 --> 00:22:41,362
OK, this time we're definitely
going to finish. OK, no.

450
00:22:41,362 --> 00:22:43,769
That didn't work either,
but OK, this sprint is the one.

451
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,400
So I don't want to say that, 
but there still is a lot to do.

452
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,340
I mean, you can't right now play the three
puzzle branches, any of them to the end.

453
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:58,340
Rice: So yeah. Try to figure out
now what you'll be looking at.

454
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:01,752
Schafer: Yeah.

455
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:10,771
So we don't know what's going to happen
because, even if this sprint did finish,

456
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,420
if we'd finish Cloud Colony
we'd be looking at like,

457
00:23:14,158 --> 00:23:16,628
looking at the design of the game
and how much time we have.

458
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:20,108
That we would not probably finish the game
in April as we had previously thought.

459
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:22,286
Rice: Um hm. 
Schafer: Which we're still thinking we're
 going to finish in April,

460
00:23:22,286 --> 00:23:26,086
Rice: No.
Schafer: we've done some math that means, 
Rice: We did some equations.

461
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,806
Schafer: And if we go past April that 
would mean going past our money

462
00:23:28,806 --> 00:23:33,246
that we got from Kickstarter, 
which would be not great to do.

463
00:23:34,632 --> 00:23:37,112
We're having discussions with Isa 
and Justin about what,

464
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,269
how we want to deal with that.

465
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,920
So I don't think we're going to
conclude any of that in this meeting,

466
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,380
but that's the problem that we're 
working on outside of this, too.

467
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,100
Schafer: So see how
much we did get done.

468
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,680
Rice: Yes. So there's, I have two 
files on Google Drive.

469
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,001
One is the budget, one is schedule.

470
00:24:01,344 --> 00:24:04,088
The original schedule that we made 
was like an attempt

471
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:07,528
to get as many people
on the team as we can

472
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,987
and try to include like all of the 
things outside of that camp

473
00:24:10,987 --> 00:24:12,127
that we need to pay for.

474
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,749
And then like fit a game 
into that time, essentially right.

475
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:22,345
And like as we were progressing 
like it was obvious that

476
00:24:22,345 --> 00:24:24,942
we weren't tracking to anything 
that was going to fit in that time.

477
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:28,385
So now the hope is to try to start from
 scratch on a new schedule,

478
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:31,091
taking in account like what we've seen 
with Cloud Colony

479
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,950
and how long it's taken us to do that.

480
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,480
How many other additional screens 
and areas are left

481
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,175
in the game as its currently spec'd

482
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,920
and try to take a new stab based on what
we know now, at how long we think

483
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,140
it'll actually take to make the game 
that you are designing.

484
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:52,620
Stamos: So the new budget for this scenario
includes going all the way to September

485
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,919
and the increased team size,

486
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:58,406
which the increased team size is, 
you know, like four or five people.

487
00:24:58,406 --> 00:25:01,610
Bailey: And has like 1.1 million
dollars more costs.

488
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,436
Stamos: Yes. But the thing
about this schedule

489
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,454
is that it assumes at a certain point 
that systems work gets done

490
00:25:08,868 --> 00:25:15,848
and that the team gains efficiency 
and the number of scenes almost doubles

491
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,285
at a certain point in the project 
in order to get it done.

492
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:21,825
So it's actually pretty aggressive.

493
00:25:21,825 --> 00:25:23,705
Bailey: Then I have to go find, 
I need to find money.

494
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:28,693
Stamos: Yeah. That is the concern.

495
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,178
Bailey: OK. Because right now,
you know, it looks like, you know,

496
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,275
the plane's kind of
diving down a little bit

497
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,980
and we just need to,
we have time to pull up.

498
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,137
Schafer: What does the
plane diving down stand for?

499
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,844
Bailey: That's, just
Schafer: Us crashing?
Bailey: Yeah.

500
00:25:39,844 --> 00:25:41,566
Schafer: The whole company
crashing into the ground.

501
00:25:41,566 --> 00:25:44,188
Is that what you're
saying or are you being,

502
00:25:44,188 --> 00:25:48,842
Bailey: I mean, the nicest, so the thing is
that Red's, this project is,

503
00:25:49,287 --> 00:25:52,142
it's going to determine 
the studio's success going forward.

504
00:25:52,142 --> 00:25:56,048
It's a major portion of my forecast 
of the health of the studio.

505
00:25:56,048 --> 00:25:59,088
It hitting next year
is absolutely necessary

506
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:06,633
and how successful it is once it,
you know, is out there and it's live, you know,

507
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,640
determines our ability to be independent

508
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,800
and kind of have our own creative control,
like that we're enjoying now.

509
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,820
So...

510
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,600
Schafer: It just seems wrong to 
make it cost more than we got.

511
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,520
Because we were so lucky to get 
the money that we got,

512
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,400
because I'm going to feel like this 
moral thing to finish it

513
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,266
for that amount of money or less.

514
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,420
And I'm sure our business guy 
would love for us to finish for less.

515
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,685
But the game also has to be really good.

516
00:26:33,685 --> 00:26:35,571
And it is an important
game to the studio.

517
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,880
And strategically it's an important
game for us because we own it.

518
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,179
We will, we don't have to share
the money with any sort of other party,

519
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,700
investor or publisher,
you know, it's all ours.

520
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,400
So it makes sense for us
to make a really good game.

521
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,240
Bailey: We have to, we have
to deliver on the vision

522
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,607
and I don't think it's going
to be done in the budget.

523
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,900
So we have to find more money.

524
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,852
And I feel like not only does it need to

525
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,623
deliver on what the
community is hoping it is

526
00:27:01,623 --> 00:27:05,632
and the people that actually backed it,
but the whole community in general

527
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,739
and the crowd funding that's actually
occurred since then, we're the poster child.

528
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,488
And we're the poster child,
you know, succeed or fail.

529
00:27:12,488 --> 00:27:16,174
And so, you know, we'd like to see 
more games funded this way.

530
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,858
Rice: I think it's also just important 
to keep in mind that

531
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,079
there's like other impacts
besides just funding the game.

532
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,167
And that like if we now go get 
a publisher for this game

533
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:27,817
then it's suddenly like voids 
everything we've said about the project

534
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,533
and everything we're trying to do.

535
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,071
It's hard and I know like we're 
looking at a number that's large,

536
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,930
that we're saying we need.

537
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:36,370
But like as much as possible 
just trying to make sure that

538
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,093
it's as good of money as this money was.

539
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,051
Bailey: I think, you know, there are,
 obviously there are financial realities

540
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,671
that we have to be conscious of,
but I mean the reality is that, you know,

541
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,853
it needs to be a Double Fine game

542
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,160
and the quality and it has to 
deliver on Tim's vision

543
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,478
and so it comes back to, 
you know, can we,

544
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,110
what would be like the 
minimum scope of the game

545
00:27:57,327 --> 00:28:01,798
that you would feel it's still, 
delivers on how you envisioned it.

546
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:03,965
Schafer: I mean, every time I've been 
up against this kind of situation,

547
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:07,049
which is almost every
time, there's scope

548
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:11,683
and then there's money,
then there's efficiencies

549
00:28:11,683 --> 00:28:15,663
and I've never seen this solved 
any other way than all of the above.

550
00:28:15,663 --> 00:28:16,861
Stamos: Yeah. 
Schafer: You know what I mean?

551
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,679
Some scope reduction, some efficiency
 improvements, some extra money.

552
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,020
Not like any one of those
things being the answer.

553
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,160
Bailey: Ok. Ok.

554
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,760
Rice: We can get it done.

555
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,040
Bailey: Should we do like an 
all hands in and team?

556
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,480
[Laughter]

557
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,480
Rice: Yeah man.

558
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,100
Rice: OK.

559
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,960
Bailey: Alright guys.

560
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,980
Rice: OK. Let's keep those.

561
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,640
Rice: Ultimately the number one 
decider in the schedule

562
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,840
is when do we feel like we 
have a game that we're proud of.

563
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,740
So it's trying to figure out 
the best plan of attack

564
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,440
to get us to where we feel proud 
of the game and are ready to put it out.

565
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,700
But I think we're safe to assume
at this point that it's definitely past April.

566
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,580
So we just gotta kind of 
figure out when that is.

567
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,980
And how we're going to get there.

568
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,980
We'll handle it.

569
00:29:31,100 --> 00:30:22,940
[Music]

570
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,860
Schafer: What we've really done

571
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,500
is we've really banked the entire 
company on this one project

572
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,744
and if even one thing goes wrong,
it'll take down the whole games industry.

573
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:40,060
Is that kind of what you're, or you mean
it like more like a Phil Fish thing?

574
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,384
Now that, you're gonna use that.

575
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:44,364
That's when you know.

576
00:30:44,364 --> 00:30:45,924
Listen, that was copyright Phil Fish.

577
00:30:45,924 --> 00:30:46,884
I can't do that.
