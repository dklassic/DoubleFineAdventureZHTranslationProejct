Offscreen Voice: Tomorrow, 
how's it going to play out?

00:00:27,187 --> 00:00:33,075
Schafer: We're going to, let's see, 
tomorrow, come in here, push the button,

3
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,221
there's a big plastic button 
in the middle of the room.

4
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:38,567
We all push it at the same time, 
put our hands in and then push it.

5
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:39,726
We totally should have that.

6
00:00:39,726 --> 00:00:42,667
That'd be much more dramatic 
than like Greg sitting at his desk

7
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:47,019
and Chris and then they tap 
and then they're like, OK.

8
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:48,299
It's off.

9
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:52,865
But that's the way it's going to go.

[Music]

11
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,000
Gardner: There's so much animation 
that needs to be polished.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,469
Crook: Well, well, there's a lot 
that's, that's done, but it's just not in.

13
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:27,666
Somewhat slow going.

14
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:32,212
Schafer: OK. Does anyone want to 
say anything about the schedule?

15
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:34,232
Like how easy it looks?

16
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,565
Rice: But yeah, there's a lot 
to do in two months left.

17
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:40,682
Schafer: Where's the warmest 
spot in this, in this office?

18
00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:42,329
Crook: Just snuggle up to me.

19
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,014
Crook: This sweater and, 
Schafer: Oh, wow.

20
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:46,654
He's so warm in there.

21
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:48,806
Look at you, you look 
like a longshoreman.

22
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:50,091
Crook: I was so cold yesterday.

23
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:52,181
Schafer: You're like a lumberjack, 
like a lumberjack by the sea.

24
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:54,936
I just need to be by Anna's heater.

25
00:01:54,936 --> 00:01:58,357
Schafer: Hey, 
is this thing even on?

26
00:01:58,357 --> 00:02:00,420
Kipnis: You want it on? Here.

27
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,300
Schafer: Gather 'round 
the fire, everybody.

28
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,359
Rice: We each should have a little fire.

29
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,276
Schafer: Hello. Is everyone here?

30
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:08,695
We'll have him, quick. OK, anyways.

31
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,473
Hey, everybody. What are you doing?

32
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:11,655
Mr. Petty, what have 
you been working on?

33
00:02:11,655 --> 00:02:12,701
Petty: What we're doing up until,

34
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:14,950
for the next couple weeks 
is getting all the new content

35
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,149
and, which I think in art, 
there's very little new content.

36
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:20,571
It's mainly us repainting 
and polishing and refining.

37
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:22,951
Ryken: Yeah, we're coming down 
to the wire but it's going good.

38
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,740
I'm working on little fix-y things.

39
00:02:25,743 --> 00:02:29,543
Things that were painted really crappily 
and are now, I'm in the time to polish up.

40
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,590
Schafer: Bagel's right here.

41
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,496
Ryken: Yes, yes.

42
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,774
I'm fixing, 
Petty: You better be referring to other work.

43
00:02:32,774 --> 00:02:35,574
Ryken: I'm fixing the things 
that Bagel's "fixing", right now.

44
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:40,185
Ryken: We're just getting 
down to the point where,

[Offscreen Voice]

46
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,070
Ryken: What?

47
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,260
Ryken: Oh, look at that! That's crazy.

48
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,571
Didn't I just do that. Petty: Yeah.

49
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,719
Ryken: He's so fast, man.

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,131
You have the rim light working on him?

51
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,040
Man, maybe I'm just slow.

52
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,015
Petty: In some cases 
we're repeating characters,

53
00:02:56,015 --> 00:02:58,815
because now that we see 
like the range of what they did,

54
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:01,954
like we repainted a Mog Chothra, 
Levi did for like the third time.

55
00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:03,859
And part of that is because 
his presence in the game

56
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:05,929
was much bigger than when 
we originally painted him.

57
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:08,621
And the type of stuff he needs 
to do for like the boss battle

58
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,099
or for these other areas

59
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:11,432
is a greater range of movement

60
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:14,510
and a lot more close-ups 
and has various mouth states.

61
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,651
So the best thing to do is like 
sometimes you can keep patching asset,

62
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:21,907
but sometimes it's best to 
just go, wipe that clean.

63
00:03:21,907 --> 00:03:24,254
And we know exactly how it's 
going to be used now, just repaint it.

64
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:25,755
So that's pretty much what we did.

65
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:28,520
And it'll pay off, because 
he has a lot of screen time.

66
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,098
Ryken: Yeah, we're not 
as pressed as the animators.

67
00:03:31,098 --> 00:03:34,557
We kind of just listen to them, 
working their ass off over there

68
00:03:34,557 --> 00:03:39,174
while we kind of just pretty things up.

69
00:03:39,174 --> 00:03:43,170
Gardner: Today I'm trying to get this 
scene in, 'cause it's such a big one.

70
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,717
It's going to be a series of 
like four different cut scenes

71
00:03:45,717 --> 00:03:47,317
that we put together in the game.

72
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:49,017
And like none of those 
are in the game right now,

73
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,080
and that's like, 
really close to shipping.

74
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,419
So it's like this last, bit of time.

75
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:55,745
Just like every other department, 
we're all kinda just like

76
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,020
rushing through everything.

77
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:02,431
Choy: The animation, like overall, 
like animation just has more work,

78
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:07,537
but a lot of times my time 
is compressed into like the last,

79
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:09,753
like couple of weeks that I can do work,

80
00:04:09,753 --> 00:04:14,517
because I come after everyone else 
and like I guess, right before audio.

81
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:18,822
Stoddard: I'm finishing all the sound 
in two weeks. Schafer: Yay!

82
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:23,891
Stoddard: I'm going, I'm basically following 
the animators as closely as possible,

83
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:28,777
because I'm trying to jump on all the cut 
scenes as they come in and like do them.

84
00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:30,497
Schafer: Ray's like, 
good luck, 'cause we're so fast.

85
00:04:31,475 --> 00:04:36,524
Stoddard: I'm trying to save January 6 
through 10 to mix the game.

86
00:04:36,524 --> 00:04:38,765
I'd really, really like to 
have that time to do that,

87
00:04:38,765 --> 00:04:42,064
so I'm trying to get in as much as 
possible in the next two weeks.

88
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:46,529
Choy: Kind even Camden and I had a lunch 
where we were kind of talking about like,

89
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:48,683
OK, well, we're here at this stage now

90
00:04:48,683 --> 00:04:50,486
where everything's 
supposed to be wrapping up.

91
00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:51,822
Like what do we do?

92
00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:54,372
Like what's the social fix for it?

93
00:04:54,372 --> 00:04:56,547
And like part of me's 
like, oh, you know,

94
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,506
like I'm just going to be 
really like irritable all the time

95
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,065
and just like be really hard, 
kind of hard to like work with.

96
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:04,092
So like if people want to make 
changes they'll be like, oh my God,

97
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:06,420
did I piss her off even more?

98
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,788
So like this, like some of that,

99
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:09,995
like there's like you kind of 
have to be a little bit of a wall,

100
00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:15,083
otherwise like, just so people, 
not necessarily to like stop changes,

101
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,063
but just so people will 
like kind of think twice

102
00:05:17,063 --> 00:05:21,310
or like maybe think smarter when 
they want to polish something.

103
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,570
Schafer: So it's a little tight.

104
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,895
This means more late 
night food for free for Ray.

105
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,103
See, so it's really saving Ray money,

106
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:33,184
'cause he's going to stay 
late to animate all this stuff.

107
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:41,911
Rice: And this is just a bunch of rice.

108
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:44,691
Crook: You see, this is the size.

109
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,861
Schafer: I've been doing 
a lot of press stuff.

110
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:49,961
We went down and showed 
the game at the VGX Awards.

111
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:50,998
Did you guys watch?

112
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:52,195
It was fun.

113
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:53,625
I got a lot of love 
on Twitter from that.

114
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,022
And a lot of people who hadn't heard 
of the game before were just crazy,

115
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,877
because I always assume the entire 
world knows all about the game.

116
00:05:58,877 --> 00:06:00,418
But I got this like, what is this game?

117
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:02,158
This looks kind of cool, 
this is awesome.

118
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:05,067
Keighley: This is really exciting, 
'cause this is a guy I've loved for so long

119
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:08,847
and we now have him 
live on the VGX stage.

120
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:10,974
Not you, Joel, but 
Tim Schafer is with us!

121
00:06:10,974 --> 00:06:12,243
Tim Schafer!

122
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:14,239
Tim is of course the creative 
genius behind Brutal Legend,

123
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:15,647
Psychonauts and Grim Fandango

124
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:18,971
and his latest is the Kickstarter 
funded adventure game, Broken Age,

125
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:21,388
which raised over three million dollars.

126
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:22,639
McHale: Three and a half million, Geoff.

127
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,740
Schafer: Thank you.

128
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,939
Schafer: He's funny. He's nice.

129
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:26,629
He was nice to me off camera.

130
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:28,149
He was like, hey, get ready for this.

131
00:06:29,243 --> 00:06:31,943
I'm going to ask you if you were 
high when you designed this game.

132
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:35,255
McHale: @Brandon 
Victoran asks, hey, Tim.

133
00:06:35,255 --> 00:06:37,597
What was the 
inspiration for the project?

134
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,637
Schafer: Well, 
McHale: Did you get high or something?

135
00:06:41,646 --> 00:06:44,606
Schafer: Uh, no, no. 
McHale: Sorry.

136
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:48,086
Remo: It's been getting really tangible, 
how excited people are to play it.

137
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:51,280
Like it's been very visible and 
you can really, you can really feel it.

138
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,736
So it's very, very exciting, like 
we have a big list of stuff to do

139
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:56,545
to get the game out.

140
00:06:56,545 --> 00:06:58,437
You know, Greg is 
obviously driving that stuff

141
00:06:58,437 --> 00:07:01,838
so it's going to be 
pretty crazy few weeks,

142
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:06,132
but I think our community is 
going to be incredibly enthusiastic.

143
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:08,157
Is going to, and really 
help us get the word out.

144
00:07:08,157 --> 00:07:10,757
So it's really good times.

145
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:14,446
Rice: I think that there's 
going to be a lot of excitement.

146
00:07:14,446 --> 00:07:16,676
Like I think we've been 
doing some bigger things,

147
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:19,831
like VGX and stuff that's been 
building up, you know, hype.

148
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:22,886
And I think that ultimately the people 
who are going to care the most about

149
00:07:22,886 --> 00:07:25,096
the game are the 90,000 
that already bought it

150
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:26,746
and they're going to be 
super-stoked playing it.

151
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,301
So I feel like there's going to 
be a huge ripple effect from them,

152
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:31,075
of them just sharing their excitement.

153
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,774
I think that that'll just be 
something that we should

154
00:07:33,774 --> 00:07:35,754
try and capitalize on 
as much as possible.

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,700
Bailey: the big splash, 
so you're thinking?

156
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,169
Rice: Yeah, well, 
I just think that yeah,

157
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:41,258
they've been waiting 
15 years for this game.

158
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:44,935
Bailey: There is the counterpoint, 
just so you know, which is that,

159
00:07:44,935 --> 00:07:47,098
that all the adventure fans 
are really interested in this

160
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:49,603
and it's a very small market and that's 
why most publishers got out of it.

161
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,746
Rice: Yeah, I know.

162
00:07:50,746 --> 00:07:53,085
Bailey: So those fans have 
basically already backed the game.

163
00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:54,405
Rice: Yeah. But that's what we're 
going to prove wrong, right?

164
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,800
Bailey: You're going to 
prove that wrong, OK.

165
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,989
Rice: Everyone is a skeptic.

166
00:07:56,989 --> 00:07:58,324
Bailey: But it still could, it can 
be somewhere between it, right?

167
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,149
Where is the genre, is say, 
you know, 500,000 people.

168
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,265
Rice: Yeah, I think that that's where 
the quality of the game is going to be,

169
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:06,604
ultimately makes a call.

170
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:09,682
Like I think if it comes out 
and reviews really well

171
00:08:09,682 --> 00:08:12,850
and people have a really great 
experience and are talking about it,

172
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,846
I think the game will be able to kind of 
live on through really solid sales.

173
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:19,444
You know, if it has 
kind of average scores,

174
00:08:19,444 --> 00:08:21,784
then it probably will 
be a different story.

175
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:23,978
Schafer: Broken Age is 
a welcome return to

176
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:25,631
the graphic adventure 
games by Tim Schafer.

177
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,671
See, I can't read this, 
it's got my name in it.

178
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,185
Schafer: We hired some 
old friends of ours

179
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:35,910
who are game reviewers 
in the previous life

180
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,138
and asked them to write 
a review of Broken Age

181
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:41,479
as if they were actually, just got 
a copy and were reviewing it.

182
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,386
To know, you know, is there some 
big thing we have overlooked or what,

183
00:08:46,386 --> 00:08:48,783
what might a review 
look like for the game.

184
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:52,183
And they came back really good.

185
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,103
Positives: intuitive point and click interface, 
good balance between exploration,

186
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,046
character interaction 
and puzzle solving.

187
00:08:58,046 --> 00:09:00,465
Game recognizes when players 
are stuck and provides clues

188
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:01,561
without giving them answers.

189
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:05,361
Negatives: I missed the inventory command 
and the opening with Shay and the spoon.

190
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:10,409
Phfft. In the gaming industry 
mock reviews are a common thing.

191
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:12,843
We have never done our own, 
so that's the good thing.

192
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:17,267
It's like a part of what we're trying 
to do is being a real self-publisher.

193
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:19,589
You know, being your own publisher 
is taking care of these things,

194
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:21,473
which are like mock reviews,

195
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:24,753
'cause they affect how much or how 
you plan your launch, you know.

196
00:09:25,752 --> 00:09:28,863
Like you would plan, if we got really 
like, if the mock reviews were like,

197
00:09:28,863 --> 00:09:30,273
ah, it's kind of rough,

198
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:32,633
but they'll probably have it sorted out 
by the time they launch Act Two.

199
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:35,985
We might think that wouldn't, we'd 
be inclined to put it in the early,

200
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:38,120
early access section of Steam, you know.

201
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,529
But if it came back, oh, 
it's super-polished and it's great.

202
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:44,048
It's like a first episode of something, 
and that means it really should be

203
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:46,448
in the other section of 
the Steam, with regular games.

204
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,241
Schafer: No.

205
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:56,978
I mean, Microsoft did play tests 
for Psychonauts and people were like,

206
00:09:56,978 --> 00:09:59,720
it got like fun-ativity 
ratings or whatever.

207
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,470
And oh God.

208
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,006
Is that what this is?

209
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:07,366
Schafer: Here's the marketing document 
that Microsoft made for Psychonauts.

210
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,240
Based on the twelve focus 
groups conducted worldwide,

211
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:12,946
the primary weakness of 
the game are the story line,

212
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,526
which is considered unoriginal, 
childish and overly complex.

213
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:22,784
Tongue-in-cheek nature of the game 
is a weakness, most simply did not get the joke.

214
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:24,730
Others disliked the satirical humor.

215
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,784
In addition, many feel the humor 
would get old limiting replayability.

216
00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:31,191
Humor should be incorporated 
into the game as a

217
00:10:31,191 --> 00:10:33,050
secondary or supporting characteristic.

218
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,930
Humor should be simplified 
and made immediately apparent.

219
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,180
[Laughter]

220
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:41,157
To help international appeal, 
limit game components

221
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:44,357
that feel especially 
Americanized, i.e. summer camp.

222
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,658
Thank you, marketing research.

223
00:10:48,658 --> 00:10:51,818
Yeah. Limit, so you can 
obviously take this stuff too far.

224
00:10:52,957 --> 00:10:54,207
I mean, good God.

225
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:57,407
Thank God we got cancelled. Anyway.

226
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,785
That's not what we're doing this time.

227
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:02,773
This time we just sent it to three 
reviewers that we knew and asked them

228
00:11:02,773 --> 00:11:05,045
to write reviews, just as if 
they're writing actual reviews.

229
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:06,745
As mean as you would have been.

230
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,667
If you've ever loved the Tim Schafer 
game, if you've ever loved whimsy,

231
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:14,286
you will love this game.

232
00:11:14,286 --> 00:11:20,384
I'm glad to see the return of the 
genre and the return of a legend.

233
00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:22,011
See why I can't read these?

234
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:23,538
That's just embarrassing.

235
00:11:23,538 --> 00:11:24,487
But it's good.

236
00:11:24,487 --> 00:11:28,757
Yeah, there's no like, like it was 
always problematic near the end of Brutal

237
00:11:28,757 --> 00:11:30,857
to hear the recurring 
stuff about the RTS stuff,

238
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,678
'cause that's really hard, 
like what are we going to do?

239
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:35,842
What the crap, 
what are we going to do?

240
00:11:35,842 --> 00:11:38,284
And EA was like, 
we're just going to, it's good.

241
00:11:38,284 --> 00:11:39,664
We're going to ship it how it is.

242
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:42,520
But here there's nothing 
about the quality of game.

243
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,381
It's more about, we have to hit the 
pricing right and we have to make sure

244
00:11:47,381 --> 00:11:50,673
the puzzles are hard enough, 
especially in the second act.

245
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:53,293
As pricing will directly affect 
the overall Metacritic score

246
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,200
breakdown of price to Metacritic 
score has been included, see page 8.

247
00:11:58,455 --> 00:12:00,995
For the purpose of this summary 
will assume a $15 to $20 price point.

248
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,580
Oh, I don't think that's 
what Justin's assuming.

249
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:08,330
He thinks if we charge $15, 
we'll get 80-85 Metacritic.

250
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,604
If we charge $20, we'll get 
79 to 80 percent Metacritic.

251
00:12:11,604 --> 00:12:15,344
Charge $25 to $30, we'll go to 
70 to 60 percent of Metacritic.

252
00:12:15,722 --> 00:12:17,022
Interesting.

253
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:22,113
Schafer: That's just him saying, 
I mean reviewers, I guess,

254
00:12:22,113 --> 00:12:25,461
take into account how much a game 
costs when they give it a score.

255
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:30,039
So it costs $60, you know, 
like geometry wars.

256
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:35,214
If that cost $60, you might give it 
a lower score than if it cost $15.

257
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,412
Schafer: We don't know yet.

258
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,409
That's the whole discussion.

259
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:41,306
Bailey: I know it's happening.

260
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:44,134
I just kind of disagree that 
that reviewer should take in,

261
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:46,221
price into consideration 
when making this review.

262
00:12:46,221 --> 00:12:48,158
Rice: Yeah, well, especially now 
since price fluctuates so much.

263
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:52,207
In the sense things go on sale so 
often and prices change and go down.

264
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:53,843
Yeah, that's a tricky one.

265
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:57,433
Bailey:  And so I saw, when I, I did my 
research so like it showed that indie games

266
00:12:57,433 --> 00:13:02,223
can be anywhere from 
like $2.99 to about $29.99,

267
00:13:02,223 --> 00:13:04,663
as like the acceptable pricing.

268
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:06,624
There was one for $34.99...

269
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:08,064
Rice: What was that?

270
00:13:08,064 --> 00:13:12,191
Bailey: Well, it was the Monkey Island 
one that came out, that Telltale did.

271
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,903
Rice: Of the Telltale, 
Tales of Monkey Island, yeah.

272
00:13:13,903 --> 00:13:15,709
Bailey: But I'm going to 
treat that as an outlier.

273
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,466
It'll be like, OK.

274
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:21,267
The idea would be on 
release you would pay $24.99

275
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,907
and then you get both 
acts, Act One and Act Two.

276
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:29,388
Bailey: It is a small genre and those 
games used to sell, like the Grim Fandangos

277
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:34,173
and you know, Full Throttles and 
stuff, used to sell like 500,000 copies.

278
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:36,783
You know, there were the hundreds 
of thousands where there were.

279
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:40,389
And you know, that's one of the 
reasons why if you can't sell, you know,

280
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:44,141
millions upon millions now, 
you know, games are considered failures.

281
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:47,585
The good thing about us, is since 
we're publishing ourselves, you know,

282
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:49,079
and it's digital distribution

283
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,622
and we can handle almost 
all aspects of the publishing.

284
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,875
And so for us it actually doesn't 
have to make a huge amount of money.

285
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,546
And 500,000 copies, 
if it sells 500,000 copies,

286
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:00,394
we'll be enormously 
successful as a studio.

287
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:05,199
That will supply like all the funds 
we need to be completely independent.

288
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,249
Rice: Anyway, this is exciting.

289
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:08,017
So, cool, man.

290
00:14:08,017 --> 00:14:10,087
Rice: Yeah, it's coming.

291
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:12,151
It's actually nice, 'cause 
when these decisions are made

292
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,307
and you're just like committed to them,

293
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:16,738
then you just kind of sit back and 
I don't know, watch things happen.

294
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:17,598
Bailey: Yeah, can you imagine?

295
00:14:17,598 --> 00:14:19,171
What would it be like if we sold like,

296
00:14:19,171 --> 00:14:23,270
if we sold like blockbuster 
numbers for a publisher?

297
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,650
God, it'd be crazy.

298
00:14:25,423 --> 00:14:27,663
Yeah. Don't know.

299
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:33,080
Bailey: No, I, it's, you know, 
basically it's the studio's dream,

300
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,398
which is to continue to 
operate independently.

301
00:14:38,398 --> 00:14:42,988
Bailey: But like this is, the awesome 
time, the awesome thing about this timeframe

302
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:45,286
is that there's not a lot 
being featured on Steam.

303
00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:49,004
So we could potentially, best case 
scenario, like Max Paine, I think got,

304
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:51,624
they got a month 
of a feature, basically.

305
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,320
If we could get that from the 28th 
all the way through February,

306
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:57,384
that would be amazing.

307
00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:02,044
Bailey: Are you OK with 
that, rather than, I mean,

308
00:15:02,044 --> 00:15:05,533
'cause I would love five 
dollars more and everything,

309
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:08,297
but I didn't want like, I just don't want the game to be, 
Schafer: No.

310
00:15:08,297 --> 00:15:11,375
I mean, I feel like you guys 
have talked it through enough

311
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:16,609
and I was nervous about it coming out at $30 
and the mock reviews wanted it to be $20,

312
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:19,716
so I think, 
Offscreen Voice: Split the difference.

313
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:22,316
Schafer: Is this a bad time 
to propose not splitting the game?

314
00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:27,413
Considered that lately? Wouldn't have 
to think about any of this stuff for a while.

315
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:31,289
No, I'm excited about shipping.

316
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:32,502
I'm excited about it.

317
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:35,125
Bailey: I think this is 
actually going to probably be,

318
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:40,013
I think it will result in a better showing 
than if you had kept it all together.

319
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:41,978
Schafer: I think it definitely got 
more people talking about the game.

320
00:15:41,978 --> 00:15:43,538
Bailey: Yes.

321
00:15:43,538 --> 00:15:45,811
But it's like, the more 
opportunities you actually have to sell,

322
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,632
actually potentially better.

323
00:15:47,632 --> 00:15:49,132
Schafer: Sell each puzzle.

324
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,700
I don't like this puzzle; 
I'd like to return this puzzle.

325
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:56,838
Bailey: Micro transactions to adventure games. 
Schafer: OK.

326
00:15:56,838 --> 00:16:00,036
Bailey: You know you have the fun start, 
about the build lockdown and timelines

327
00:16:00,036 --> 00:16:02,916
for all the stuff that 
needs to get done.

328
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:07,208
So when is the build, like 
when are we done touching it?

329
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:08,636
Rice: Yeah. I don't know.

330
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:13,006
That's a question that I would like 
to involve other people in, like Oliver.

331
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:16,355
Offscreen Voice: So you know, 
what is happening at this point?

332
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:18,507
Franzke: A lot, a lot is happening.

333
00:16:18,507 --> 00:16:25,155
Yeah, we kind of just switched into, 
I guess what's often called finaling mode

334
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:28,585
where it's a lot of, I'm basically 
going away from working on tasks

335
00:16:28,585 --> 00:16:31,724
and more towards fixing 
issues in the game.

336
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,444
Just so that we can maybe get a stable 
version that can be released eventually.

337
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,251
Romero: That's a crash.

338
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:47,494
Yeah, you can press "space" 
to skip the cut scenes.

339
00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:51,682
So in this particular case, for some, 
you just skip the cut scene and crash.

340
00:16:51,682 --> 00:16:55,285
Yeah, we've skipped that cut scene, 
I want to say thousands of times,

341
00:16:55,285 --> 00:16:56,921
you know, collectively.

342
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:59,701
And now it decides to 
crash for some reason.

343
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,422
That's really how 
most bugs are found.

344
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:04,888
You're not trying to 
do something, it happens.

345
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:08,045
What I've learned is that the nature 
of the adventure game is that it's,

346
00:17:08,046 --> 00:17:09,810
everything is very handcrafted, right?

347
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,946
You want to control every step of 
the way because it's all story driven.

348
00:17:12,946 --> 00:17:17,232
And because of that, you have 
so many little points where it just,

349
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:19,520
there's a bad graphic 
or the audio's off

350
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,246
or characters look weird 
doing a particular action.

351
00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:26,691
And because they want a very 
specific type of sort of experience,

352
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:28,935
like to look a certain way 
and sound a certain way,

353
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:32,951
you just end up with a lot of little bugs 
in between all the big functional stuff.

354
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:36,380
So functionally, I mean, it's not 
too complex, you know, point and click.

355
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,892
I'd say our save load system 
is probably the most complicated

356
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,689
because save load's 
always complicated anyway.

357
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:43,496
And at this point it's just polish.

358
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:47,238
Little graphics things, animation, 
there's a lot of missing audio, stuff like that.

359
00:17:47,238 --> 00:17:49,302
So this is the Broken Age database.

360
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:51,960
This is the list of all bugs.

361
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,205
This particular issue is going to be 
for Oliver, which means it's a system bug.

362
00:17:57,205 --> 00:17:58,516
And that's it.

363
00:17:58,516 --> 00:18:02,569
Once you have all the detail, 
the title, the steps, any attachments,

364
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:03,694
if you need them.

365
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:04,908
In this case we don't.

366
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:07,579
Submit the bug and off it goes.

367
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:11,099
Franzke: The QA team is very, very good 
at like describing exactly how they got to

368
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:15,299
this and they even say sometimes oh, 
this doesn't happen all the time.

369
00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:21,061
So there's a problem in this particular 
scene where the characters occasionally

370
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:23,168
will kind of, you see the jitter?

371
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:26,112
See, see how this 
kind of like jitters? So OK.

372
00:18:26,112 --> 00:18:29,211
So at first, the first thing I do, I will 
actually look at the scene and you know,

373
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:30,719
try to see the problem like this.

374
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:33,224
Like oh yeah, obviously 
that's something going on.

375
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:36,746
Then we have certain tools 
in the game that we can use

376
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:40,022
to kind of just trying to figure out 
what's, what's happening.

377
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:44,352
I can actually pause the game in the 
auto-debugger that we wrote for the game.

378
00:18:44,352 --> 00:18:46,403
And I'm going to, you know,

379
00:18:46,403 --> 00:18:50,827
basically step through frame 
by frame in this particular case.

380
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:53,278
And then I very often will 
just look at, OK, so first of all,

381
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:54,877
do those numbers line up?

382
00:18:54,877 --> 00:18:59,190
Because like, you know, the camera, 
animation has to be at the exact same frame,

383
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,165
then the characters.

384
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:03,162
And I already see like, 
you know, this set of frames, 732

385
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:06,191
and this is like at the frame 734.

386
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:08,987
So like weird, 
why is this happening.

387
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:14,244
And then I basically will have to 
go into visual studio where they'll,

388
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:18,614
you know, the code is for 
the game, like animation control.

389
00:19:18,614 --> 00:19:22,923
A lot of what I do is actually just 
understanding what is going on.

390
00:19:22,923 --> 00:19:25,082
Like that takes 95 percent of the time.

391
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:27,730
Once you know what's going on, 
very often the fix is pretty easy,

392
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,973
but you know, since there's so 
much code and so much things,

393
00:19:30,973 --> 00:19:32,831
so many things going 
on at the same time,

394
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:36,479
the understanding what is actually 
happening is usually the way, way, way more

395
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:41,018
difficult part of actually 
implementing a fix for it.

396
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:46,596
But yeah, I mean, that's like 
in a nutshell what's going on.

397
00:19:46,596 --> 00:19:49,753
Romero: And then on our end, 
I just try to get to the tasks.

398
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:54,049
Like we have a lot of bug regressions 
right now, just 'cause they're fixing quicker

399
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:56,595
than we can check them to make, 
to verify that they're fixed.

400
00:19:56,595 --> 00:20:00,531
So we always have just a backlog of 
bugs we need to get through on that end.

401
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:01,507
And new bugs.

402
00:20:01,507 --> 00:20:02,644
Like I said, don't stop.

403
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:05,657
So at this point you can't 
afford to ignore any bug.

404
00:20:05,657 --> 00:20:07,306
So you see it, you report it.

405
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:10,395
Yeah, every time you hear a little 
groan or something coming from that end,

406
00:20:10,395 --> 00:20:13,343
that's probably every new bug.

407
00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:16,329
Franzke: I think animation is 
winning the bug count right now.

408
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:18,051
And it probably will be until the end.

409
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:22,504
So a lot of it is just, you know, 
animation polish and stuff like that.

410
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:24,700
I think they probably have 
like twice as many bugs,

411
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,967
any of the other like departments.

412
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:30,264
Roberts: Yeah, and this 
is all animation bugs.

413
00:20:30,264 --> 00:20:33,372
So it's something like 130.

414
00:20:33,372 --> 00:20:36,303
Essentially right now the red 
ones are unfinished cut scenes.

415
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:41,166
And so that's what we're 
striving to do by tomorrow.

416
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,677
They're set by priority.

417
00:20:42,677 --> 00:20:44,348
And it doesn't, 
it doesn't show it here,

418
00:20:44,348 --> 00:20:48,197
but there's Pri-1, Pri-2, 
right down to 4, I think.

419
00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:51,889
Four would be like, it'd be 
nice to have, but not essential.

420
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:55,622
And 3 is like we should fix it, 
otherwise it'll look crappy.

421
00:20:55,622 --> 00:21:01,204
And 2 being it is going to look really 
bad and unfinished if we don't do this.

422
00:21:01,204 --> 00:21:04,615
And 1 being a breaker, like it 
actually just breaks the game.

423
00:21:04,615 --> 00:21:05,839
Gardner: When you get 
into bug fixing phase,

424
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,341
a lot of time animators 
will be like oh, I want to,

425
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:09,744
like this is the animation 
that we should be polishing,

426
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:13,856
but instead I'm polishing this animation 
because this is reported as a bug.

427
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,393
It's stuff that I'm like, that should 
be fixed and that should be fixed.

428
00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:17,660
Nobody cares.

429
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,953
Like, I'm like, like 
it's like high fantasy.

430
00:21:19,953 --> 00:21:23,104
Like I'm really into it, 
but like not everybody else is.

431
00:21:23,104 --> 00:21:29,538
Roberts: What I'm really trying 
to do is not get freaked out about,

432
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,650
about things right now,

433
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,338
because the holidays are coming up and I just want to relax and rebuild my energy.

434
00:21:35,338 --> 00:21:37,050
And then come back strong.

435
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:41,616
We could be panicking right now and we probably should be panicking,

436
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:42,720
but I'm not going to do that.

437
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,088
I'm Zen right now.

438
00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:45,963
I'm just going to, I'm just going to turn off

439
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:48,781
and then when I come back on the second,

440
00:21:48,781 --> 00:21:51,089
that's, it'll be time to freak out for me.

441
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:54,429
Franzke: Again, I think the problem is to some degree,

442
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:58,806
it feels like the release day is far away, but it's really not.

443
00:21:58,806 --> 00:22:00,819
Because it's like, oh, it's next year, right?

444
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,097
That's, you know, once you say that,

445
00:22:02,097 --> 00:22:03,684
we're going to release the game next year, that feels like, oh,

446
00:22:03,684 --> 00:22:05,834
that's so far away we don't really need to worry about it too much.

447
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:09,970
But I think in terms of working weeks that we have until the game ships is like

448
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,487
two or two and a half.

449
00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:12,986
So it's really not that much time,

450
00:22:12,986 --> 00:22:16,995
given the amount of issues that are being reported.

451
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:19,640
It's somewhat scary for sure.

452
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,012
So yeah, it's like a lot of people do tend to work, you know, late hours now,

453
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:27,210
starting now but then, 
you know, also people

454
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,118
leave for Christmas break and stuff like that.

455
00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:33,567
And so it's kind of a weird kind of thing going on.

456
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:35,248
Franzke: Say something or are we just standing here?

457
00:22:35,248 --> 00:22:36,361
Schafer: Yeah, we're all going to stand.

458
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:37,940
Kipnis: What are we saying?

459
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:41,309
Schafer: Happy holidays, I think we say.

460
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:42,686
That's what the Christmas card says.

461
00:22:42,686 --> 00:22:43,981
Well, I am going to say something.

462
00:22:43,981 --> 00:22:45,420
Rice: And then we'll all say "happy holidays".

463
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,406
Schafer: This is all going in and out.

464
00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:49,968
Hello, adventure gamers from 
everyone on the Broken Age team.

465
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,859
We just wanted to say happy holidays.

466
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:55,141
Happy holidays? Happy holidays.

467
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:56,228
Hey. Get back to work.

468
00:22:56,228 --> 00:22:57,908
Finish it, finish it.

469
00:23:03,553 --> 00:23:05,435
Ryken: We had one little 
portion of the tree showing,

470
00:23:05,435 --> 00:23:08,046
so we had two little 
ornaments that we put on it.

471
00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:10,445
Their mind will fill in the rest, right?

472
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:12,645
It'll be like, hey, great job.

473
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:29,526
[Music]

474
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,720
Schafer: OK, hello, hello, everybody!

475
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:34,735
It's so nice to see you all.

476
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:35,840
Everyone here?

477
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,142
Everybody ready to go?

478
00:23:37,142 --> 00:23:38,481
Hello, Happy New Year to you all.

479
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:40,048
This is the first meeting since 
the new year began, right?

480
00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:41,291
Yeah, yeah, welcome back.

481
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:45,574
I'm so glad some of you 
survived the holidays and driving

482
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:49,894
and you all decided to come 
work here for another year.

483
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:54,415
Speaking of that, 
Bagel's actually been here 13 years.

484
00:23:54,415 --> 00:23:57,935
[Applause]

485
00:23:57,935 --> 00:23:58,719
Schafer: No, no.

486
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:00,159
No clapping, he's not here.

487
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,770
Sorry, Bagel, you're not here.

488
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,971
Yeah, you can clap.

489
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:04,155
He's actually coming up to visit.

490
00:24:04,155 --> 00:24:06,188
Does anyone know when 
he's coming out to visit?

491
00:24:06,188 --> 00:24:10,363
He's coming here on, 
Offscreen Voice: On his fourteenth year.

492
00:24:10,363 --> 00:24:12,043
Schafer: And he'll be 
here for two weeks?

493
00:24:12,043 --> 00:24:13,243
Offscreen Voice: Until the 31st.

494
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,275
Schafer: OK, awesome.

495
00:24:15,415 --> 00:24:16,755
So then you can clap for him then.

496
00:24:18,342 --> 00:24:22,066
Let's talk about Red's for a second, 
just 'cause it's launching next Tuesday.

497
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:23,686
To backers.

498
00:24:23,686 --> 00:24:25,774
We are shipping this thing to backers.

499
00:24:25,774 --> 00:24:31,144
And then on the 28th it's going to 
go out to the regular rest of the world.

500
00:24:31,144 --> 00:24:32,206
But yeah, this is exciting.

501
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:34,800
We have, we're all working 
on the Bugzilla right now.

502
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,364
Everyone knows what they're doing 
pretty much, so why are having these days?

503
00:24:37,364 --> 00:24:38,462
I guess just to cheer everyone up.

504
00:24:38,462 --> 00:24:39,750
Hey, you guys!

505
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,101
We're going to ship a game.

506
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:42,454
Rice: Now I think let's talk 
about lockdown and stuff like that.

507
00:24:42,454 --> 00:24:44,824
Schafer: And that. 
So lock it down, people.

508
00:24:44,824 --> 00:24:46,264
Rice: Oliver, you want 
to talk about lockdown?

509
00:24:46,264 --> 00:24:48,024
Franzke: Sure. 
Lockdown, let's do it.

510
00:24:48,024 --> 00:24:50,685
It's good. Right.

511
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:52,569
I mean everybody's 
still working and I,

512
00:24:52,569 --> 00:24:55,813
I mean I see like lots of 
things still happening this week.

513
00:24:55,813 --> 00:24:59,792
However, I'm, I am going to get 
the release kind of branch ready.

514
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:04,476
Basically I'm going to manually 
integrate changes into the,

515
00:25:04,476 --> 00:25:07,657
like nothing goes into the branch 
without, you know, me looking at it,

516
00:25:07,657 --> 00:25:10,525
make sure that it's like, there 
are no risky changes going in.

517
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:13,840
And like the amount of risk is going 
to be reduced over time, for sure.

518
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,264
Just to make sure that the 
build is as stable as possible.

519
00:25:17,264 --> 00:25:20,407
So just like how we do 
in the past for build days.

520
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:23,944
Like we basically going to just try to play 
through the game and individual changes

521
00:25:23,944 --> 00:25:27,590
that need to go in for the 14th, 
they will be manually integrated.

522
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,687
Schafer: Talk to Oliver directly.

523
00:25:28,687 --> 00:25:29,967
And you'll make an angry face.

524
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:31,094
Franzke: I will make angry face.

525
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:33,118
Schafer: Show me the face you 
have to see if you want to add, yeah.

526
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:34,278
You'll have to look at that face

527
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:36,716
if you want to add anything 
to the game after Thursday.

528
00:25:36,716 --> 00:25:41,781
Franzke: Right now Linux 
is driving me insane, but I'm sure,

529
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:42,951
she'll do all good.

530
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:44,819
But other than that it 
looks pretty stable recently

531
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:47,040
and I would like to 
keep it that way for sure.

532
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,038
Schafer: OK, great.

533
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:49,838
Any other questions?

534
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:50,518
All right.

535
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,954
Go check Bugzilla.

536
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,100
See you guys later.

537
00:25:54,514 --> 00:26:31,388
[Music]

538
00:26:31,388 --> 00:26:33,213
Crook: We're doing pretty good.

539
00:26:33,213 --> 00:26:38,174
We're at final stretch 
for the backer build.

540
00:26:38,174 --> 00:26:39,831
So this will be a Beta build.

541
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:44,334
So it needs to be, not 
completely bug-free, but mostly.

542
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:46,689
Last night I got home about 1:00.

543
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,903
I get home about 1:00 and then 
I couldn't sleep for about two,

544
00:26:48,903 --> 00:26:52,189
I just at in bed for two hours, 
just like thinking about today

545
00:26:52,189 --> 00:26:56,225
and what we had to get 
done and it's just like, just stupid.

546
00:26:56,225 --> 00:27:01,515
I got to, you know; 
see my kids and my wife.

547
00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:05,580
So yeah, I have an aunt that's visiting 
right now, I haven't seen her yet.

548
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,410
She's been here for like four days and 
I haven't, I literally haven't seen her yet.

549
00:27:11,982 --> 00:27:14,273
Crook: Yeah. Camden's 
getting hit probably the worst

550
00:27:14,273 --> 00:27:18,960
because cut scenes come in, 
you know, really late in the game.

551
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,200
Yeah, I think Camden has 
stayed here a couple nights.

552
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:27,723
Stoddard: I'm having to 
revisit a lot of things.

553
00:27:27,723 --> 00:27:32,439
Things get redesigned or they get 
polished and timing has to move around,

554
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:34,239
which is cool.

555
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:37,208
But there's a lot.

556
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,900
[Explosion sound]

557
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,347
OK. That's fine.

558
00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:50,500
This is a hard, hard crunch 
but it's more about getting it right.

559
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,455
And I've been on other crunches 
where it wasn't about that,

560
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:57,292
it was about we got it wrong 
and now we have to fix it.

561
00:27:57,292 --> 00:28:01,342
I'm just here because I 
know if Double Fine makes it

562
00:28:01,342 --> 00:28:06,610
and really, really makes this 
happen, it's going to be amazing.

563
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,729
It's going to be an amazing company.

564
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:14,184
I mean, it's already good, but 
we're just like struggling for years.

565
00:28:14,184 --> 00:28:19,235
And I think a lot of people here kind 
of hang on because like they know,

566
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:22,363
they know Tim, they know, 
they know the management,

567
00:28:22,363 --> 00:28:26,426
they know the vision and 
if it hits, it'll be really good.

568
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:27,598
It'll be really good.

569
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:30,058
So we're just hanging in.

570
00:28:31,284 --> 00:28:36,524
Schafer: We are launching 
Red's tomorrow, crazy time.

571
00:28:36,524 --> 00:28:38,450
All of our backers.

572
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,175
[Applause].

573
00:28:41,175 --> 00:28:43,650
Thank you to our 
team for working so hard.

574
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:48,678
We are going to the backers tomorrow 
and the rest of the general population,

575
00:28:48,678 --> 00:28:51,698
future backers, if 
you will, on the 28th.

576
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:57,223
Rice: Ah, we're about to launch a game.

577
00:28:59,243 --> 00:29:01,850
In eight minutes.

578
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,791
I feel like, I feel like I'm kind of even 
in the same boat as backers,

579
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:08,242
which is that's this, a really 
surreal thing that's happening.

580
00:29:08,242 --> 00:29:10,578
I don't know.

581
00:29:10,578 --> 00:29:12,008
It's been a long time 
in the making, you know,

582
00:29:12,008 --> 00:29:18,492
it's two years almost now since 
we launched the Kickstarter and yeah.

583
00:29:18,492 --> 00:29:20,530
Sometimes it just felt like it 
was never going to get here and

584
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:26,462
now it's here and you know, 
this is something that really shouldn't exist.

585
00:29:26,462 --> 00:29:30,001
Like it's crazy that this exists 
and was able to be made this way

586
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:33,289
and that the game that we've 
made is something that's coming out.

587
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:38,384
You know, I grew up playing 
Tim's old adventure games, young,

588
00:29:38,384 --> 00:29:40,735
like in elementary school.

589
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:46,214
And I feel like they were kind of the 
games that showed me that games

590
00:29:46,214 --> 00:29:49,853
could be like an art or could be 
something different or something bigger.

591
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:53,655
And you know, the fact 
that I'm here now,

592
00:29:53,655 --> 00:29:55,687
like working on this 
game and putting this out

593
00:29:55,687 --> 00:29:59,643
is really a dream and the weirdest 
thing that's ever happened.

594
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:00,985
And the best thing that's 
ever happened to me.

595
00:30:00,985 --> 00:30:04,013
So it's exciting.

596
00:30:04,013 --> 00:30:05,741
Schafer: All right. I've got to call 
my mom and say happy birthday.

597
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:08,202
Rice: What?

598
00:30:08,202 --> 00:30:10,060
Schafer: I got to call my 
mom and say happy birthday.

599
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,191
Rice: Oh, yeah. Do that.

600
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:14,171
Schafer: We're releasing our game today.

601
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:20,613
Yeah, well, it's, 
it should go out at 10:00,

602
00:30:20,613 --> 00:30:23,217
which is now so it's 
going to be out there.

603
00:30:23,217 --> 00:30:24,857
And Dad can help you download it.

604
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,040
OK, happy birthday, mom.

605
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,700
Rice: The game is up.

606
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:33,445
Preorders are up.

607
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:35,280
Schafer: Whoohoo! Rice: Yeah.

608
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,373
Schafer: All right, next game.

609
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:39,126
Rice: Yeah, we're going 
to take everybody out.

610
00:30:39,126 --> 00:30:43,525
So there's going to be a team 
lunch today, probably drinks later, too.

611
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:46,880
I'm going out for drinks, 
so I hope people will join me.

612
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,694
But yeah, we're going to 
take everybody out for lunch

613
00:30:48,694 --> 00:30:51,811
and thank them for all the hard work

614
00:30:51,811 --> 00:30:56,359
and just take a nice breather 
before diving back into Two Act.

615
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:59,079
Schafer: So thanks, everybody.

616
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,720

618
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,140
Schafer: Hey it's Nathan Bagel Stapely!

619

Schafer: This is downloading, 
start playing now.

622
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,630
Let's hope you did a good job, Tim.

623
00:31:42,661 --> 00:31:46,168
Me and my two girls 
sitting on my lap, can't wait.

624
00:31:46,168 --> 00:31:48,608
Sounds like I'd buy that for a dollar.

625
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,206
Played 30 minutes, very happy so far.

626
00:31:52,206 --> 00:31:56,254
Thanks to you and the Double Fine team. 
Rice: Yay!

627
00:31:56,254 --> 00:31:59,375
Schafer: It's like send 
any little bit of feedback.

628
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,339
OK, I need some more proof 
that people are playing it.

629
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:04,165
Rice: Tim, there's Twitch streams.

630
00:32:04,165 --> 00:32:06,399
Schafer: Well, I don't 
want to watch that.

631
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,939
Well, maybe I do.

632
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,598
Oh, man. This is weird.

633
00:32:17,598 --> 00:32:20,043
He's going to pick 
avalanche, no, foreign body.

634
00:32:20,043 --> 00:32:21,923
Foreign body, hull. Train.

635
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:25,540
Foreign body, oh! Avalanche!

636
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,934
That's good. Very good, avalanche.

637
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:29,634
Now I'm totally into watching that.

638
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,371
Schafer: What if he just said 
something really crappy right now.

639
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,471
Computer Voice: All right.

640
00:32:44,471 --> 00:32:46,855
Looks like that'll be it, guys.

641
00:32:46,855 --> 00:32:50,028
Thanks a lot for watching 
and if anyone who is watching

642
00:32:50,028 --> 00:32:54,784
is involved in making this in any 
shape or form, then congratulations.

643
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,554
I think this is a winner.

644
00:32:57,554 --> 00:33:36,834
[Music]

645
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,326
Game Character: 
I'm going to sit here forever.

646
00:33:43,634 --> 00:33:44,774
Offscreen Voice: 
But I don't know I need those yet.

647
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,280
Schafer: Because you 
fell through the clouds.

648
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,780
Offscreen Voice: I don't know why 
my character knows that she needs them,

649
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,370
'cause she hasn't heard any...

650
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,628
Schafer: She's just interested in shoes.

651
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:52,873
Offscreen Voice: No, that's not true.

652
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,040
Schafer: And she 
fell through the clouds.

653
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,302
Offscreen Voice: The other guys 
in there said that I needed shoes.

654
00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:56,402
Schafer: Yeah.

655
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,680
Offscreen Voice: I don't know if I clicked 
on that dialogue option, though.

656
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,520
Game Character: What 
are you doing down here?

657
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,700
Vella: I'm an offering 
for the Maidens Feast.

658
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,677
Schafer: She fell through the clouds.

659
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,560
Obviously she knows 
she needs cloud shoes.

660
00:34:11,252 --> 00:34:12,806
You're playing it wrong.

661
00:34:12,806 --> 00:34:14,706
Game Character: Kind of shabby 
looking for a Maidens Feast.
