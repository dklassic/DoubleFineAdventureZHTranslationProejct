1
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,980
[Buzzing noise]

2
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,459
[Schafer laughing]

3
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,940
Schafer: Oh my god.

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,460
Schafer: There you go.

5
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,900
Schafer: I forgot to put my beard on 
this morning, you're right.

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,620
I left that beard at home.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,440
People are going to
know it's a fake beard.

8
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,131
Rice: I think that it's also just 
important to keep in mind

9
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,782
that there's like other impacts besides 
just funding the game and that

10
00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:10,631
like if we now go get a 
publisher for this game,

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,332
then it's suddenly like voids 
everything we've said about the project

12
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:15,612
and everything we're trying to do.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,300
Schafer: Where did we leave off?

14
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,635
Oh, that's right.

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,876
Game was too big, company's
going to close down,

16
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,680
didn't have any money 
and Cloud Colony wasn't done.

17
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,232
Bailey: Like because right 
now, you know,

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,723
it looks like the plane's kind 
of diving down a little bit

19
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,690
and we just need to,
we have time to pull up.

20
00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:35,045
Schafer: What does the plane 
diving down stand for?

21
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,843
Bailey: That stands for
Schafer: Us crashing?

22
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,360
Schafer: The whole company 
crashing into the ground and burning?
Bailey: [laughing]

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,520
Rice: A lot actually.

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,571
Well, I mean right
after that episode aired,

25
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:46,180
yeah, right after that episode 
aired we started Amnesia Fortnight

26
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,960
so the team kind of took a break 
from everything for a little bit there.

27
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,590
Schafer: Amnesia Fortnight is
 coming up, people.

28
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,134
And you forget what we 
were working on for two weeks,

29
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,260
that's where the name comes from.

30
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,634
We split the company into small groups,
sometimes four or five groups.

31
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,946
And each group has to make 
a game in two weeks.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,574
Rice: I think ultimately that 
was an amazing process

33
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,371
and people had a great time and
just came back really energized after that.

34
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:12,352
And a lot of progress has already 
been made in this month since then.

35
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,323
Things are definitely moving along quicker
and we're starting to address

36
00:02:15,323 --> 00:02:20,723
a lot of potential ways to help
make production go smoothly

37
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,963
and on a lower budget than
it's looking like it could.

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,655
Schafer: There's scope and then there's
money, then there's efficiencies.

39
00:02:29,718 --> 00:02:33,538
And I've never seen this solved 
any other way than all of the above.

40
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,900
Stamos: Yeah.
Schafer: You know what I mean?

41
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,460
Some scope reduction, some efficiency
improvements, some extra money.

42
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,380
We've been working on 
simplifying some stuff.

43
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,520
J.P.'s come on

44
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,025
and we've been trying to look at things
in the spaceship we can simplify.

45
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:47,125
We cut some room, cut the teleporter
rooms, cut some simple stuff.

46
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:51,445
But it's more like an ongoing thing,
simplifying it as we go.

47
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,141
You know, you want to make the game, 
most of the backers

48
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:57,552
I think would be unanimous in saying
they want a great game, right?

49
00:02:57,555 --> 00:03:01,392
So they're trusting me 
to use the judgment

50
00:03:01,392 --> 00:03:04,372
of like how much to cut that 
still makes it a great game.

51
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,990
And they don't want us 
to cut more than that,

52
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:10,226
so we just have to, we've 
been working on that problem.

53
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,340
Bailey: I'm not privy to what's actually
going on in the scoping side right now.

54
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,622
Although I hear that they're,
they're making some progress.

55
00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:21,027
On the funding side I was 
able to bring in a few deals

56
00:03:21,027 --> 00:03:25,967
that don't require any 
kind of creative control.

57
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,703
So like Brutal Legend PC, which to me
is potentially, you know,

58
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:35,455
better on PC than it would be on console,
because it's an RTS.

59
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:37,161
It has RTS elements.

60
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:39,641
It's never actually been released 
and it's got, you know,

61
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:41,988
huge amount of music 
already licensed in it

62
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:48,529
So we moved that up and you know,
we're looking to release that pretty soon.

63
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:53,698
And all or, no, some or all of
those profits will probably go back to Red's.

64
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,120
Schafer: I mean...for
one of our other games,

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,627
he found a licensing deal in Korea

66
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,269
So there's extra money and revenue
that can come in through that.

67
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:04,289
And that's the kind of 
stuff I would never have,

68
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:07,409
I can't whip up a Korean licensing deal
on my own, I'd have no idea.

69
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,080
How do you, who do you even call?
Do you know any-?

70
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,740
We got such a response to Majus's print
 from the last episode

71
00:04:14,744 --> 00:04:16,914
that we can now, now selling the print.

72
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:19,154
Each one is a new line of dialogue
that I can put in the game,

73
00:04:19,154 --> 00:04:21,654
so think about it that way.

74
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,577
Bailey: I don't know how much money
is actually going to be enough.

75
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,580
So for me, like my mandate is more.

76
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,640
Because I want Tim to be 
able to completely check out

77
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,800
and when he feels the game's 
done, then it's done.

78
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,580
Stamos: New addition to my office.

79
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,440
It's pretty exciting.

80
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,160
There's nothing much on it yet.

81
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,900
Oh, except there's a 
red milestone right there.

82
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,081
I want to see how that goes.

83
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:51,871
We're working on all kinds of things
throughout the whole studio.

84
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,460
But when it comes to Red's we're

85
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,120
I come in as more of a
"how can we control costs?"

86
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,880
Hansen: This still is adding up to six
and a half months of tech work so [laughing]

87
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,140
we gotta find out.

88
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,418
Franzke: Oh that's just even 
split across all the ...

89
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,840
Hanson: Well it was eight 
and a half months before

90
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,380
Franzke: But that actually makes sense to me,
that this is kind of like a relief [laughs].

91
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,660
Stamos: More, more needs to be done
to really understand

92
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,960
what's left to do and
how long that will take.

93
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,440
Really like kind of refactoring all of our
assumptions about that schedule.

94
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,500
Really I think getting some project 
management attention on it.

95
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,260
Matt Hansen coming in and working on 
that uber-schedule so we can

96
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,440
really plan out what's happening
a little bit more down the road.

97
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,578
Hansen: Obviously Greg's already
the producer on the project.

98
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:48,061
But you know, it's super-important
for the studio, really important for us.

99
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,180
And you know, it's one of our
completely self-funded projects

100
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,360
so it's one of the things
where it did make sense

101
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,340
to bring on additional production help

102
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,640
to make sure that we're, we're running as
effectively and efficiently as possible.

103
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,920
I have some expertise from working in 
adventure games in the past

104
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,500
so I think that's something they
wanted to bring onto the team

105
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,140
to help make it go smoothly as possible.

106
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,741
I'm actually pulling a lot from my
experiences on those games

107
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:20,102
to understand how to schedule the game,
scope it properly and stuff like that.

108
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,920
Hansen: I still have this remote deployment harness as
something I'm going to have to talk to Tim about.

109
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,000
I really want to push forward on that.

110
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,157
I think it's going to be really helpful
for debugging the game later on.

111
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,700
Franzke: I agree.

112
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:35,856
Otherwise we're just going to
shoot ourselves in the foot.
Hansen: Yeah.

113
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,200
Rice: And yeah, it's been helpful.

114
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,358
I think it's just like , it's nice to
be able to kind of hand it off to him

115
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:43,295
and kind of get ahead
of things a little bit.

116
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:45,185
It's going to be really helpful.

117
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:48,086
Hansen: Developing an engine and
a game at the same time,

118
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:50,680
it's always been a challenge 
for a lot of different games.

119
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,720
You'll hear that as a common story for
a lot of games where they're, you know,

120
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,392
it's like, Limbo's a good example,

121
00:06:56,392 --> 00:06:57,961
where they were trying to 
develop the engine for Limbo,

122
00:06:57,961 --> 00:07:00,038
they're also trying to create 
the game at the same time.

123
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:01,498
It's huge, hugely challenging.

124
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:03,173
Hansen: All right. That's it.

125
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:03,933
Thank you very much.

126
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,918
I'll start laying this out and then
let's talk about maybe later.

127
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,520
Franzke: Yep.
Hansen: Later next week. Thanks a lot.

128
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,460
Stamos: So that's been huge.
I think that

129
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,699
having additional gameplay
programmers added to the team,

130
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,020
but who have design experience,
that that's probably helping.

131
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,180
Rice: Yeah, we just added
a handful of people to the team,

132
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,960
kind of staffing up a bit.

133
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,900
And it was people that were on The Cave 
and that just shipped a few weeks ago.

134
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,260
[Applause]

135
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,420
Gilbert: Well, we shipped The Cave.

136
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,960
[Cheering]

137
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:41,200
Gilbert: On 742 platforms,
so that's good news.

138
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,580
Anyway, I just, you know,
a toast to everybody

139
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,860
and they just did an
amazing job on The Cave.

140
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,000
Group: Cheers!

141
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,860
And now what you have 
all really been waiting for, cake.

142
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,500
Group: [laughs]

143
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,260
Schafer: Scoop it up with his hands

144
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,140
Put it in everyone's mouth

145
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,360
Line up.

146
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,437
Rice: And so they just are wrapping up their
final tasks and bug fixes for that

147
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,965
And as they become available,
we're just trying to figure out

148
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:12,804
what makes the most sense for him to be
working on and right now that is Reds.

149
00:08:12,804 --> 00:08:18,655
So we've got someone from every discipline
added to the team and kind of helping

150
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:22,775
to lighten people's loads and add some 
extra manpower to the game.

151
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,340
Schafer: Everyone's here, OK. Awesome.

152
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,300
Dailies. Film crew's back.

153
00:08:28,302 --> 00:08:29,367
Not that you notice.

154
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:33,225
I'm sure you guys are all, for those of you
who have not ever been filmed before,

155
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,193
if you ignore them, really,

156
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:38,239
They'll just, they'll catch
you picking your nose.

157
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,220
Rice: We're too big now. I don't know
how they're going to do this.

158
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,000
Schafer: I know, look how huge we are.

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,900
Let's get this over with. OK.

160
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,620
Yesterday I was going to write those
last  three things for the Cloud Colony,

161
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,280
but I did a whole bunch of
other project review stuff.

162
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,720
LeBreton: It was pretty easy 
to pick up on, you know.

163
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,960
Anna was teaching me
a whole bunch about the systems

164
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,599
that she wrote on the game play,

165
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,540
which is mainly what
I've been working with.

166
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,200
Just figuring out how,
how dialogue, I've been,

167
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,804
a lot of my work has been wiring up
the dialogue trees, you know.

168
00:09:04,804 --> 00:09:07,107
We got the writing from Tim
and then we got scratch VO,

169
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:11,330
so I wired that up so you 
can pick, "tell me more"

170
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,680
or "what about this" or "see you later."

171
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,560
Thomas: I guess you're better at
spotting fakes than the other birds.

172
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,560
Hey, can you take me here to my home?

173
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,100
You can? Great!

174
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,524
Ever seen this place? Great.

175
00:09:29,524 --> 00:09:31,153
Can you take me there right now?

176
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,755
LeBreton: I enjoy all
phases of a project.

177
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,959
You know, if it's a good project then
it's fun to be in on the early inception

178
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,459
where you're getting to like, you know,

179
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,778
help really make big 
important creative decisions.

180
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,155
It's fun to be in the middle 
where you're producing stuff,

181
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,640
you know, you're building it

182
00:09:44,648 --> 00:09:46,924
and eventually hit that 
critical mass where it's like, yes,

183
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:49,104
we have a game now; we know 
what we're building.

184
00:09:49,104 --> 00:09:53,609
And then late in the game,
if you're not, you know,

185
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:55,531
if you're not stressing out too much
about like, you know,

186
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:57,213
fires that you have to put out,

187
00:09:57,213 --> 00:09:59,628
it's really fun to like see the
last few steps come together

188
00:09:59,628 --> 00:10:02,531
and really feel like some, like you're
putting polish on something.

189
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,459
So all of those are cool.

190
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:08,047
But yeah, I think we're very much
in the middle.

191
00:10:08,047 --> 00:10:10,147
We're kind of like in
the early middle in this.

192
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:13,440
So yeah, no.

193
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,858
And I've worked, you know, I've, yeah,

194
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,007
I've led stuff before but also just
been in the trenches guy.

195
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:23,492
So you know, depends,
again, if it's a good project,

196
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,888
then I'll enjoy, and I can contribute
something substantial to it.

197
00:10:26,888 --> 00:10:28,928
That's all I really care about.

198
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,873
Garner: It was on budget, on time;

199
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,211
everything was great.

200
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,514
You're going to, you're going 
to go home early, no overtime.

201
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,900
Then I saw Episode 7
and I was like, aha.

202
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,620
Just the normal stuff.

203
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:50,769
They were just like, 
would you be interested in DFA,

204
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,400
Tim wants you on that project so bad.

205
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,900
He's always talking about 
Dave being in on the project.

206
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,100
Schafer: We got Dave Garner, 
famous fan of Ico

207
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,766
and Shadow of the Colossus.

208
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,060
Garner: That shit is so awesome.

209
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,875
Schafer: And adventure games.

210
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,080
Yes, Garner's here because 
adventure games are not dead.

211
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,867
Garner: Adventure games are not dead.

212
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:16,072
Garner: When I came on, I initially,

213
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,313
like the characters have 
so much style in them.

214
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,476
The first thing that I 
thought about was like,

215
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,111
I'm just going to like focus 
on animating real subtle stuff

216
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,432
and like focus on the face 
and like focus on the eyes.

217
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,249
That stuff's important in 
like films and stuff

218
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:31,072
but we don't usually do 
that stuff in games.

219
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,700
But I feel like that's one of the things
that we want to try to do with this one.

220
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,314
Garner: This is when we were
experimenting with like,

221
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,166
you know, what kind of an 
attitude should he have?

222
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,589
Like sort of blank look on 
his face, that's like kind of bored

223
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:44,558
because he's on the ship 
and getting sick of this stuff.

224
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:47,964
And he's got like, you know, 
his idles would be like, he's just like,

225
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:51,904
overall he's not too stoked on all
the stuff that's going on, on the ship.

226
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:54,584
But then when you start 
playing with him and explore,

227
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:57,281
like we were saying it'll 
start getting really cool

228
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,401
when he's just going
to be like, oh my God!

229
00:11:58,401 --> 00:11:59,160
This is awesome!

230
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,580
A lot of people aren't
really going to notice that,

231
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,030
but like, hopeful some person 
is like, oh yeah, that's really cool.

232
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,539
Like that boy, like I've seen him 
change throughout the game, which is not

233
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,451
something not I've really 
done with a character in a game before.

234
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,478
Is like have them go from, 
you know, one character type

235
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:18,704
and, like actually end the 
hero's journey having gone through it,

236
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,202
make, you know, an
emotional journey as well.

237
00:12:21,202 --> 00:12:23,562
Which is something you see 
in movies, just not so much in games.

238
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,600
Schafer: Who else got added?

239
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,466
We got Lydia.

240
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:26,556
We've had Lydia for a little while.

241
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,211
Lydia's a great effects artist, 
technical artist.

242
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,934
Does a little programming on the side.

243
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,780
Small teams, everyone has 
to do a bunch of stuff.

244
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,129
Choy: Generally I just go through and
just try to add things wherever I can,

245
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:39,659
because like with this Cloud Colony.

246
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,229
The more, the more there's 
like little support ambient effects,

247
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:45,869
the more alive it feels.

248
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,340
Schafer: I think this ground 
looks so pretty now.

249
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,180
And the little dust, and 
the poofs and everything.

250
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,331
And look at that thing up there!

251
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,887
What's happening up there?

252
00:12:56,887 --> 00:12:58,075
Is that 3D?

253
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,656
Petty: Well, it's an old 
PlaysStation One trick.

254
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,340
We just took the texture 
and put it on crisscross polygons.

255
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,060
And just spun it around in 3D.

256
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,200
Schafer: Oh now I hate it.

257
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,355
Now that I know.

258
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,880
Cheating, now I hate it.

259
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,520
It looks amazing.

260
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,204
Melian: So here's like a new 
thing we're trying out.

261
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,340
It's actually using a 3D, a 3D element.

262
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,984
And you'll see it again.

263
00:13:19,286 --> 00:13:21,006
So we're experimenting with that now.

264
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,436
Melian: I think so.
I think that's the idea.

265
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,900
If we can get these 3D elements 
working and kind of blending in there

266
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,415
without popping out too much, 
I think that's the idea.

267
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,600
And we'll go in and try to 
do that more and more.

268
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,000
Schafer: Whoa color!

269
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,340
Oh there's a mom!

270
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,860
Hey, hi, mom.

271
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,720
She's got hair that comes 
off of the crystal ball.

272
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,406
Peck: I guess last week was 
like really my first time,

273
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:50,308
my first week where like I really got
to spend like a lot of my time on Red's.

274
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:51,208
Really fun.

275
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,378
Basically Lee's been working really
hard getting the environment white boxed

276
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,246
so you can actually just walk around.

277
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,900
And I'm just following behind him 
wiring up the basic puzzle structure

278
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,780
as it comes in.

279
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,372
Yeah, this is the first piece 
of color art we've got on this.

280
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,131
Like a rough color.

281
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,280
But still amazing.

282
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,696
It really reminds me of like, 
you have a giant art book,

283
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,209
like hard cover picture
book in front of you

284
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:24,786
and just like turning the page 
and being really immersed in the art.

285
00:14:24,786 --> 00:14:29,697
Like you know, with the old 
pixel-based adventure games,

286
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,101
they didn't have like this 
camera flowing over things

287
00:14:34,101 --> 00:14:36,141
and zooming in and panning out as much.

288
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,232
And this really feels like 
I'm being like guided through this,

289
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,400
this really beautiful experience.

290
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,940
So that's what's really 
captured my imagination so far,

291
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,900
is like this story is just being 
presented in such a beautiful way.

292
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,400
I'm really excited to see like 
where, how far we can push that.

293
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,143
Peck: Let me just load up 
a certain level accepting.

294
00:15:00,143 --> 00:15:02,742
Yeah, I'll open up the galley. Yeah.

295
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:05,882
Yeah, the bedroom and the 
galley have the rough color.

296
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,620
It's amazing. It's like super cool.

297
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,180
Look how rough this is, 
but there's still this like epic scale.

298
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,395
You know, you're supposed to be
floating out in space in a space suit,

299
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,035
but everything but man.

300
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,052
This really blew me away 
when I saw that. So yeah.

301
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:28,680
I'm excited to talk to Bagel when he
comes in and be like, awesome job, man.

302
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,100
Stapley: So yeah, I guess lightings
 down here and just try to tie it

303
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,420
a little in with that one.

304
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,220
I feel like these are, I mean 
they're not totally different.

305
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,798
This color, I kinda like 
this being more white.

306
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,247
I feel like this is a little too orange.

307
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,907
I mean, I guess it's just the 
orange light, but still, yeah.

308
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:55,387
Maybe a little bit more yellow.

309
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,340
Hey, Tim. I'll get him later. 
I say go for it.

310
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,060
Brand: It's a really
good learning experience.

311
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,640
I really like Bagel's style.

312
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,932
Yeah, he drew like a really 
awesome style guide

313
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,754
that might pretty up the 
different areas of the ship.

314
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,940
You know, the vibe each one should
give off and like the color palettes.

315
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,880
And a lot of the references 
he was using to derive that look.

316
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,201
So like the player living area,
utility area and then there's an off-limits area

317
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:22,541
for later in the game.

318
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,620
He took that and then did the, 
some even more like specific breakdowns

319
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,924
with just a bunch of
inspirational windows

320
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:33,959
that, with those shapes
and colors that he likes.

321
00:16:34,241 --> 00:16:35,738
Stapley: I always go to orange.

322
00:16:35,738 --> 00:16:38,958
Orange and brown and red is 
like shit that I always fucking do.

323
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,180
I mean, I feel like, I mean it's 
a little crutch that I have.

324
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,200
Not a crutch but it's
like my go-to color.

325
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,180
All the time.

326
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,140
But yeah man.

327
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,360
You can nail it.

328
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,518
Stapley: Your colors are awesome.

329
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,780
Rice: And I'm excited to see the space
stuff starting to come together, too,

330
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,839
because Tim just delivered the 
dialogue for the boy's,

331
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,963
like first segment of the
game and it's amazing.

332
00:17:03,963 --> 00:17:04,983
It's hilarious.

333
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,963
And you can so easily see how 
fun it's going to be to play through.

334
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:10,583
Rice: Yeah, but like reading through it,
I don't see any holes.

335
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,903
Like I feel like,
Schafer: It's fucking perfect.

336
00:17:12,903 --> 00:17:14,819
Rice: I feel like the game play
programmer could script that all up now

337
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,198
without needing any
questions, which is awesome.

338
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,760
Schafer: So no
questions will be allowed.

339
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,754
Schafer: I think spaceship boy's
stuff is easier, like the basic setup of it

340
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,320
leads it to, it's funny because 
it's just, there's more humor in it.

341
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,001
And you would think you could 
just make everything funny equally

342
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:47,278
but like the boy stuff's
just naturally funnier

343
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,901
because he's all alone with his mom,

344
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:51,213
the tension between him and his mom

345
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,280
and all the little robots and all
the silly scenes he finds himself in.

346
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,976
I have to figure out something for the
girl's world that makes it that easy to put,

347
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,420
to put jokes in there.

348
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:03,198
Here's a picture of
the climax of the game.

349
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,140
Do you want to see my pictures?

350
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,454
Total spoiler right there.

351
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,520
Can you see that?

352
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,602
Stamos: Yeah, I think that the 
change that I've seen the most is Tim,

353
00:18:10,602 --> 00:18:12,090
you know, absolutely.

354
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:17,030
Because he, he seems really 
motivated to kind of get things going.

355
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,888
And also he's, he's
getting really close to

356
00:18:18,888 --> 00:18:21,974
the point of the entire
game's designed out.

357
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,080
And I think that will be a big,
pretty big milestone.

[Juicer whirs on]

359
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,280

364
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,960
Schafer: The juice fast is 
all part of, you know,

365
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,840
when New Year's comes around 
you make a bunch of resolutions.

366
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,941
And it's, my resolution was not to
die before my daughter got in college.

367
00:18:48,523 --> 00:18:52,003
And also watching this documentary
and seeing my gut enter the room

368
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:53,577
like five minutes before I did.

369
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,520
It was just like, ah, got
to do something about that.

370
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,877
So now I look all shrunken
and my neck's all wiggly.

371
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,624
So you just can't win.

372
00:19:00,624 --> 00:19:03,204
You just can't win and 
I got a gallstone probably, so.

373
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:05,804
Just lose, lose scenario, documentaries.

[Whooshing slows down]

375
00:19:08,884 --> 00:19:11,364
Schafer: I need a glass. Did 
anyone else want juice?

376
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,215
Schafer: Yeah. I used to get a 
lot more sleepy in the afternoons

377
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,280
and I don't know if that's coffee 
or that's just being super fat.

378
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,000
Schafer: Alright. Pack up some 
juice to take with me.

379
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,900
Cheers.

380
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,673
How much weight did I lose 
while I was drinking that?

381
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,320
Did you notice?

382
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,020
You see like shrinkage? 
Like, blugh.

383
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,206
Schafer: According to the Internet,

384
00:19:40,206 --> 00:19:41,946
I'm like 230 right now.

385
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,803
Schafer: Like one site said 
my weight should be 160 pounds.

386
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,300
And I started this at 260.

387
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,600
So I'm down 30 pounds.

388
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,420
Daughter: What?

389
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,968
Schafer: You get to come 
shave off my beard.

390
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:57,668
Daughter: Papa, I don't 
know how to shave.

391
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,820
Schafer: Well, there's a time 
in every girl's life

392
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,140
when she needs to 
learn how to shave.

393
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,120
Schafer: Here we go. 
Here we go.

394
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,900
[Buzzing]

395
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,933
I'm really not going to do it.

396
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm not going to do it.
This is terrible.

397
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,620
This is a horrible mistake. 
Look at that.

398
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,004
Schafer: I used to just grow 
a beard every Christmas,

399
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,124
like a Christmas beard, it'd
start around Thanksgiving.

400
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,900
Ray got me started on that.

401
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,293
And then one year I grew the Christmas
beard and I gained so much weight

402
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,772
while I had it on that when I went 
to shave it off, I was like holy crap!

403
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,780
Where was all this hiding?

404
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,119
And then I was like,
I'm going grow it back.

405
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,722
'Cause you actually believe
that if you grow a beard,

406
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:30,350
you can totally hide
the fact that you're fat.

407
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,897
No one will figure it out.

408
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,209
I didn't mean to look at the 
people with beards when I said that.

409
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:37,927
And as, like when I get down 
to that weight again, I'll shave it off.

410
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:38,587
And so I shaved it off.

411
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Schafer: I feel really dumb with this.

412
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,579
Try to get respect in a meeting.

413
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,540
I think here's a new design, you guys.

414
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,660
[Laughter offscreen]

415
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,660
[Buzzing]

416
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,640
This is now, this is my look 
from like the '90s.

417
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,180
It was most of '90s.

418
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,560
I'm going to go all the way, you guys.

419
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,820
Schafer: If you think about it,
the car is just a metaphor for my body.

420
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,180
They're both essentially 
really good looking,

421
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,688
but they've been, you know, 
neglected a little bit over the years.

422
00:21:22,688 --> 00:21:24,068
It's got some scratches.

423
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,700
There's a big knife hole 
in the top of it, just like me.

424
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,820
It's a little rusty.

425
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,300
It doesn't start in the morning.

426
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,120
It's full of gas.

427
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,330
Etcetera, etcetera.

428
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,511
And my car is something that 
I've been like just looking at,

429
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,917
I should really take
care of that eventually.

430
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,425
Kind of like, like, ah, I should 
really lose this weight eventually.

431
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:50,096
So I tweeted like anyone 
know a good mechanic?

432
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,822
And of course, John Romero 
and Brenda Romero,

433
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:57,102
like we have this guy who's perfect for 
a MoPar, which is what my Barracuda is.

434
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,322
And I went down there
and John showed up.

435
00:22:00,322 --> 00:22:02,345
And of course I'm all excited 
about getting my car fixed.

436
00:22:02,345 --> 00:22:05,566
And then John pulls up in this amazing 
like, pretty much a brand-new,

437
00:22:05,566 --> 00:22:08,586
like Road Runner,
like '68, '69 Road Runner.

438
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,285
And it's all shiny.

439
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:12,780
The engine is cleaner than 
anything in my house.

440
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,042
Like you could eat off it.

441
00:22:14,277 --> 00:22:15,377
It's beautiful.

442
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,570
And my car's sitting there all sad.

443
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,000
Schafer: My sad old car.

444
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,600
Schafer: Which brings out a whole 
bunch of different issues for me.

445
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,993
Like why aren't I rich like John Romero?

446
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,607
Next year I'll get on that.

447
00:22:30,607 --> 00:22:32,325
This year I'm just going
to get the car fixed.

448
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,760
And I started feeling the money flow out
of my body as the guy was talking about

449
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,580
all the work he wanted to do on it.

450
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,800
Schafer: How expensive is this going to be?
I just want to get it running.

451
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,520
Schafer: So I need this game to be a hit
to get out of the debt I'm going to accrue

452
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,720
by getting that car running again.

453
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,920
[Engine roars]

454
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,791
Schafer: I think the
situation with our cars

455
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,640
really shows our levels of 
financial success in the industry.

456
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,520
Schafer: And then John took me for 
the most terrifying drive of my life.

457
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
[Engine accelerates]

458
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,660
Schafer: Jesus Christ!

459
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,920
[Romero laughs]

460
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:15,363
Schafer: It was like, in the car, 
he hit the gas and it felt like,

461
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:17,883
like a sledge hammer just 
punched in the back of my neck.

462
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,820
Just snapped back like
Aaaagghh!

463
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,520
[Engine roar; screaming]

464
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,811
And then John's driving.

465
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm sure John is a really good driver, 
but I'm not 100 percent sure about that.

466
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,040
[Engine roar]

467
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,620
Schafer: I thought I was gonna die.

468
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,260
Romero: Yeah! 
[Laughs]

469
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,360
Thanks for the ride, John.

00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,440
[Booing; Jeers]

471
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,760
Offscreen: Who are you?

472
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,000
Offscreen: Looks like a baby!

473
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,478
Schafer: All right. I know I don't 
have the authority anymore.

474
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,899
Just look at me.

475
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,120
You'll get used to it.

476
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,315
Schafer: I shaved the beard,
I'm on a diet.

477
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,141
Fixed the car.

478
00:24:08,141 --> 00:24:09,682
I'm getting my writing done.

479
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:13,302
It's just a new, all new me.

480
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,640
For a couple months.

481
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,560
Then i'll just go back.

482
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,442
Schafer: Red's.
Let go to projects. Red's,

483
00:24:21,442 --> 00:24:25,015
We finished the sprint on Friday 
and we're now looking at the build

484
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,966
and trying to see how we 
get ready to actually play-test

485
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,606
and maybe a HOF-style 
play-test with you guys.

486
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,020
Who would like to do that.

487
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,289
Maybe even, well, soon. Soon.

488
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:37,664
Let's just say soon.

489
00:24:37,664 --> 00:24:39,533
Rice: That stands for Hour of Fun.

490
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,180
It's something that's been happening 
here at Double Fine for a long time.

491
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,018
Schafer: All right. Everyone
excited about the HOF?

492
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,960
First HOF.

493
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,440
Who's new, raise your hand, 
if you've never been in a HOF?

494
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,500
So you've all done HOFs before.

495
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,807
Let me tell you about the Hour of Fun.

496
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,351
Schafer: So way back on Psychonauts, 
we found a lot of people had not played

497
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,791
the game, like some of the animators 
had never booted up and played it.

498
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,480
I was like, how are we going to understand
our game unless everybody plays it?

499
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,289
So we had the mandatory 
Hour of Fun on a Friday.

500
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:10,224
Everybody had to stop working 
and play the game for an hour.

501
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,268
And then we did this thing 
where we met afterwards

502
00:25:12,268 --> 00:25:14,288
and be like, ask everybody 
what they thought.

503
00:25:14,288 --> 00:25:16,818
And it was really terrifying 
that people actually talked about it,

504
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,057
but really good because we 
got a lot of good feedback.

505
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,650
And so we did it all through Brutal.

506
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,140
We'd play the game and then 
everybody would just get to say

507
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,346
whatever they felt about it.

508
00:25:25,346 --> 00:25:28,223
Schafer: When you're milling around,
talking to people, try not to,

509
00:25:28,223 --> 00:25:31,138
we try to not to influence people 
too much when they're playing the game,

510
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,223
because we'd really like to get, 
I think the most important feedback

511
00:25:34,223 --> 00:25:37,092
is getting people to talk 
about what they're trying to do,

512
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,065
because that's the stuff you 
miss in adventure games a lot,

513
00:25:39,065 --> 00:25:42,077
is like they're dragging this object 
that doesn't make any sense.

514
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,033
And they're like oh, well, 'cause everyone
knows the bananas are flammable;

515
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,732
I'm just putting them in, like oh God.

516
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,847
Like we never thought of that.

517
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:48,822
So catching what
people are trying to do,

518
00:25:48,822 --> 00:25:51,178
getting them talking
out loud is really good.

519
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,646
For the most part just watching, 
observing people and just, we don't,

520
00:25:55,803 --> 00:25:59,547
just try not to, there's a tendency 
you want to explain, like oh my God!

521
00:25:59,547 --> 00:26:01,765
That's, that's going to be much 
better when you play.

522
00:26:01,765 --> 00:26:02,725
Don't worry about that, 
that's going to be really great.

523
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:03,963
Just don't even bother with that.

524
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:06,270
Just let them, let them 
hate the game, 'cause you know,

525
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,886
the next HOF they'll be like, oh my God,
you got so much more improvements in.

526
00:26:08,886 --> 00:26:10,627
It was great. OK.

527
00:26:10,627 --> 00:26:12,644
This is going to be exciting. Whoo.

528
00:26:12,644 --> 00:26:17,484
Schafer: Everybody will be playing the
game and then meeting afterwards to say,

529
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,660
I don't like this game.

530
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,781
Or I love this game.

531
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:23,323
Then we'll also have an 
anonymous survey

532
00:26:23,323 --> 00:26:27,303
where people can say 
I just don't like Tim, whatever.

533
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,660
Rice: So we're going to be doing that 
on the Cloud Colony this afternoon.

534
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,345
We've been working to kind of 
polish that level up a bit

535
00:26:34,345 --> 00:26:36,425
and get a lot of the details in there

536
00:26:36,425 --> 00:26:40,250
that a first time player would need
to be able to understand what's going on.

537
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,520
Franzke: So the main things that we
need, just make it playable like,

538
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,822
can you basically go through 
the entire Cloud Colony

539
00:26:47,822 --> 00:26:51,382
without needing to load, 
reload the game and stuff like that.

540
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,171
Well, the major things that I am 
focused on is mostly crashes.

541
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,812
Really, it's kind of anything that
seriously goes wrong under the hood

542
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,040
where stuff just falls over and dies.

543
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,340
And it's good we got test 
support last week a little bit,

544
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,580
so finally testers playing the game.

545
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,402
And looking at stuff and 
they find things which is good.

546
00:27:11,402 --> 00:27:13,782
And then we can go in 
and fix those hopefully.

547
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,188
Rice: Yeah, we finally
testers on the game.

548
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:18,777
So they've been, you know, finding bugs

549
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,460
and putting them in our bug 
database for us to fix.

550
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,700
Lo: Before I started
working as a tester,

551
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:30,380
I would basically spend eight hours 
a day playing video games every day.

552
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,820
And now that it's my job, 
I come home and I'm like,

553
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,073
I still look at a computer monitor

554
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,720
but I like, I don't really feel 
like playing games that even,

555
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,291
that I've been excited for.

556
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,570
In fact, I think it actually made me 
less excited for certain games.

557
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,558
I'm only excited for like 
games that I really love,

558
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,480
whereas before I was like, oh, 
I kind of like that game.

559
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,827
I might buy it.

560
00:27:54,827 --> 00:27:55,627
And I'll play it.

561
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,881
It actually made me more 
selective of the games

562
00:27:57,881 --> 00:27:59,681
that I would actually beat nowadays.

563
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,420
And it takes a lot for a game 
for me to actually complete it now.

564
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,020
So yeah.

565
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,919
But before there was an issue where
you pick up the ladder from that kid,

566
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,460
and then you pick up the egg.

567
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,640
There would be, it would just 
crash the game for some reason.

568
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,840
There's that.

569
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,440
She just shoots in the top of ladder.

570
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,120
She doesn't have any
pupils for some reason.

571
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,372
Franzke: Very often it's like, 
like a big shaky house

572
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,840
in the way like if you push it 
at the wrong place it would fall over.

573
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,360
Just the way it is.

574
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,160
But yeah.

575
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,565
The trick is to find, the trick 
is to find all those places

576
00:28:40,565 --> 00:28:42,845
that the user can directly influence.

577
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,620
Directly or indirectly make 
sure that those are failsafe.

578
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,247
And any good.

579
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,140
Schafer: OK. Thank you for 
coming to our very first HOF.

580
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,878
We have the build, ready to go.

581
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,253
Some of you might have 
installed it already.

582
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,295
Oliver sent out a mail,

583
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,916
a copied it on my mail so you 
can just install it on your computer.

584
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,457
And it should just magically run 
if you click on the "run" batch file.

585
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,920
It is a point-and-click
graphic adventure.

586
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Offscreen: What?

587
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,660
Offscreen Voice: They don't 
make those anymore.

588
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,580
Offscreen Voice: Those are dead.

589
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,269
Garner: Adventure games are not dead.

590
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:15,288
Schafer: Thank you.

591
00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:17,978
Schafer: It has been almost one year since
we launched our Kickstarter, by the way.

592
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,464
And now we're having our first HOF.

593
00:29:19,464 --> 00:29:21,504
And so we have done a lot of stuff

594
00:29:21,504 --> 00:29:23,906
to get this adventure game engine 
up and running and working

595
00:29:23,906 --> 00:29:28,495
and we have a several room area of
what's called the Cloud Colony to play.

596
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,163
And we'd like to watch you play it.

597
00:29:30,163 --> 00:29:32,851
Franzke: If it crashes like please come 
to any of the Red's programmers

598
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,660
so we can help you, hopefully.

599
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,620
Also if it crashes during the game, 
which hopefully it won't, please don't.

600
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,320
If you press F1

601
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,060
and then go to "load" you can restore
the previously, previous game state.

602
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,623
Schafer: OK, see you later.

603
00:29:45,623 --> 00:29:47,263
We'll call you back in
here in about half an hour.

604
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,739
Schafer: What, you didn't
find a bug, did you?

605
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,400
Kipnis: What? 
Schafer: You didn't find a bug, did you?

606
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,980
Stapley: To soften the blow of failure.

607
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,900
Yeah!

608
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,080
Offscreen Voice: Add something
on to that, some choices, right.

609
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,100
I sent one to them.

610
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,228
I think it was like,

611
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:17,342
who's Jessie or 
something like that, right.

612
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,300
And then he said it, and I thought 
it would take me back to

613
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,349
where I could ask something else, 
like something else about the towers.

614
00:30:24,643 --> 00:30:28,963
I guess I'm going down, the talking 
tree or something like that.

615
00:30:28,963 --> 00:30:30,901
Raz: Man, I don't know,
I don't know what,

616
00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:39,221
like what's the first thing to get, 
what to say, how do I kill this guy?

617
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,659
Rice: All the other one's good.

618
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,540
Have you seen the one here, 
if you, go ahead, nothing.

619
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,029
Schafer: We aren't talking about, 
Rice: We're talking about you.

620
00:30:51,835 --> 00:30:55,155
Just keep going. 
They updated the one here.

621
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,620
If you aren't coming up 
that ladder, it's really nice.

622
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:04,260
Ryken: Adventure games are very quiet 
during HOFs, a lot of thinking going on.

623
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,000
Petty: Oh, Drew crashed it.

624
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,740
Schafer: What? Who crashed?

625
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,360
Kipnis: What was the last thing 
that you did, do you remember?

626
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,140
Inversin: I just went down the ladder 
and zoomed in on her

627
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,711
and the curser appeared and then 
the arrow appeared and it just froze.

628
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,180
Franzke: Yeah, I'm not sure what's
 happening with that crash button.

629
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,020
Chi: This is what happened 
when I went in here, so.

630
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,813
OK, this is where I crashed.

631
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,480
Franzke: OK, thank you.

632
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,559
Franzke: That's the other thing, 
that Tony plays,

633
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,480
through Visual Studio in debug.

634
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,240
And he could reproduce a new bug.
So it's Windows only, XP only.

635
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,240
Dillon: That sounds
like a fun bug to fix.

636
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,460
Rice: That's the prettiest scene too.

637
00:31:50,660 --> 00:32:01,440
[Music]

638
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,640
Schafer: Hello, hello.

639
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,640
[Murmuring]

640
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,469
Schafer: Hello. Thank you for playing, 
thank you for playing Red's.

641
00:32:12,469 --> 00:32:14,724
The first people who
have ever played Red's.

642
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,380
Patrick, you looked sad
there for a second.

643
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,096
Did you play?

644
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,042
Hackett: The game was
extremely charming.

645
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:21,302
It's really good.

646
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,360
But...

647
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,480
[Laughter]

648
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,920
Schafer: But...

649
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,826
Hackett: It's, there's just small things

650
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:35,586
like I wanted to speed up some 
of the lines when they were repeating.

651
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,960
I wanted an explanation of 
what was in my inventory.

652
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,717
Franklin: The areas, someone said, 
I think it was a little unclear

653
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,948
where the camera would pan 
and where it wouldn't.

654
00:32:43,948 --> 00:32:46,382
Also as visually, maybe it wasn't 
clear if there was like,

655
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:48,502
hey, there's more
down there or there isn't.

656
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,713
That was a big one.

657
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,551
Muir: I definitely had camera issues.

658
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,672
When it stops working,
you're like, oh shit.

659
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,314
Like I can't go, you know,it's like I'm
walking to the edge of the screen

660
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,441
and like it's happening and 
then it gets really confusing.

661
00:32:59,441 --> 00:33:02,743
So I mean, I guess it's just like 
a little buggy in some of those areas.

662
00:33:02,743 --> 00:33:05,721
But yeah, just no camera bugs, 
I would suggest.

663
00:33:05,721 --> 00:33:08,134
Yeah, that's my suggestion.

664
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,618
Eliminate the camera bugs.

665
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,271
Remo: Obviously the background 
art is incredibly gorgeous.

666
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,667
The whole game is really beautiful,

667
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:17,475
but the specific style of 
the art means everything

668
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,347
just looks like part of the background

669
00:33:20,347 --> 00:33:23,036
and I don't get that feeling that 
I often get in adventure games of like,

670
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,945
oh, these are hot spots.

671
00:33:23,945 --> 00:33:25,874
I should be clicking these things.

672
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,951
And then when there were things that
I thought I should be able to click on,

673
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,337
like a big nest of eggs or something,

674
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,720
instead my character would just try 
and path to like a plane behind it

675
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,298
and go around, because 
it's not actually clickable.

676
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,282
So I felt like the game was 
discouraging me from

677
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:41,443
trying to actually interact with 
things and find things,

678
00:33:41,443 --> 00:33:47,217
which is like to my memory, 
what adventure, playing adventure games,

679
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,752
that feels like a big part of it.

680
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,620
And I felt like this game 
didn't want me to do that.

681
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,317
Schafer: I'm a strong believer in being,
having a thick skin about feedback.

682
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,250
Like, 'cause when I've done writing, 
I've done writing in a writing group

683
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,686
and you get together and you read 
your stuff and people give you feedback.

684
00:34:01,686 --> 00:34:02,969
And you should be,

685
00:34:02,969 --> 00:34:04,832
you should say thank you when they
say something bad about your script,

686
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,517
'cause that's the thing that 
if you can turn it around,

687
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,989
it now makes your script better 
or your writing better.

688
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:12,887
So any feedback we get, even 
if it's negative is like a gift,

689
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:14,782
because that's just an opportunity 
to make the thing better.

690
00:34:14,782 --> 00:34:18,186
And it's better you hear it from 
your team than a game reviewer

691
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:19,799
or someone in the public.

692
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,269
Boehle: As I just was exploring the dialogue,
I kind of got a better sense of like,

693
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,068
oh, I want to kill the creature but oh,

694
00:34:26,068 --> 00:34:29,136
I guess the next time the creature's 
going to be there in Shellmound.

695
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:31,990
and oh, I guess I need this sap 
to attract the creature in Shellmound.

696
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,024
and know I need to take 
the tram to get there.

697
00:34:34,024 --> 00:34:36,591
And so I liked how it was 
a very natural progression,

698
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,186
just by talking to people 
without even having to solve puzzles,

699
00:34:39,186 --> 00:34:41,882
just to figure out what 
I wanted to do as the character.

700
00:34:41,882 --> 00:34:45,196
Martz: And I agree that it has like a, 
kind of an open-ended quality,

701
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,079
but I definitely would have appreciated
some more like concrete goals.

702
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,000
Dawson: A little more back and forth
 between the characters.

703
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,896
Each kind of revealing a little bit 
of their world to each other.

704
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,888
That might have filled you in a little.

705
00:34:56,888 --> 00:34:57,981
Muir: I think I especially noticed it

706
00:34:57,981 --> 00:35:00,397
when I was talking to the Harmony dude.

707
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,690
And it was just like everything 
that he said was just like, oh my God,

708
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,273
that's another thing
that I don't know about.

709
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,658
So like the whole world felt
super-alien and just like, just super-weird.

710
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,483
Schafer: So you really have to 
get good at trying to like

711
00:35:12,483 --> 00:35:15,443
pry out of them what
their experience is.

712
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,260
Like if they think, well, 
this dialogue sequence is too long,

713
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,832
but it's really that the music 
that was playing is looping too much

714
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,924
while they're doing it or 
the dialogue is too long.

715
00:35:24,924 --> 00:35:27,128
And you know, just, you got to, 
you got to take all that feedback

716
00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:29,828
and try to turn it into a 
useful task to make the game better.

717
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,444
LeBreton: It sounds like
partly you were just like,

718
00:35:32,444 --> 00:35:33,648
like when you're talking to the elder,

719
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:36,261
you were just kind of feeling 
some exposition fatigue, right?

720
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:37,404
Like, 
Muir: Yes.

721
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:39,277
LeBreton: he had lots to 
tell you and I don't know,

722
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,121
spreading that out somehow or just...

723
00:35:41,121 --> 00:35:44,306
Muir: And it was like single world, 
single word questions

724
00:35:44,306 --> 00:35:46,602
that you're clicking on to like, 
for their progressed like,

725
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,019
LeBreton: Metal Gear. 
Muir: Yes!

726
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,280
It totally reminded of Metal Gear.

727
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,458
I don't want to say that.

728
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,600
Schafer: Well, we're going 
for a Metal Gear thing.

729
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,520
LeBreton: Obviously.

730
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,540
Schafer: Who found the cardboard box?

731
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,640
Schafer: That was great.
That was pretty good.

732
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,360
Most of it was directed toward stuff 
that we just know we have to do anyway,

733
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,818
that's already on the list to get done.

734
00:36:01,157 --> 00:36:04,236
Schafer: You've been
through HOFs before.

735
00:36:04,236 --> 00:36:05,976
Schafer: I was going to say, watching it
through other people's eyes,

736
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,620
I was really proud of how much 
work that you guys got done

737
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,505
because it was like, the girl had an
egg on her head and shoes on her feet

738
00:36:10,505 --> 00:36:12,424
and she was kicking up dust 
and she was climbing ladders.

739
00:36:12,424 --> 00:36:15,124
And I was like, this game 
is way too complicated.

740
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,902
Who came up with all this stuff?

741
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,520
So we'll start thinking about 
a thread for all of this.

742
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,985
Thanks for everyone hustling 
to get the build running.

743
00:36:20,985 --> 00:36:21,841
It worked great.

744
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:23,093
I was very proud of it.

745
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,539
It was awesome.

746
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,205
I hope no one's feelings got hurt.

747
00:36:26,205 --> 00:36:28,534
Schafer: To some like, yeah, 
I do need to clarify the goals and the characters

748
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,220
that's going to be hard to do.

749
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,268
Just more work for that one,

750
00:36:31,268 --> 00:36:33,819
but there's nothing that came up 
that was really terrifying,

751
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,520
like oh God, how are we…

752
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,500
You know, when you're doing a game

753
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,728
that has a lot of physical 
action and stuff in it,

754
00:36:38,728 --> 00:36:41,158
sometimes people are like, 
it's just not, the bad,

755
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,595
the swordplay's not fun, you know.

756
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,933
And then you're just like, oh, 
how are we going to solve that?

757
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,124
You know, it's just
another iteration around.

758
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:49,883
But I think everything, everything 
that was said could easily

759
00:36:49,883 --> 00:36:52,143
be turned into a task that 
we can use to make the game better.

760
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,143
So that's good.

761
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,500
Schafer: I appreciate
you guys playing it.

762
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,354
Thank you for playing.

763
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,457

770
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,862
Schafer: And some people were 
looking for a different experience.

771
00:37:41,862 --> 00:37:45,595
Like you can tell some people were
really into just progression and beating a game,

772
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,740
which is not necessarily what a,
I mean, adventure games are kind of about that,

773
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,790
but they're also for enjoying the ride.

774
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,300
So hopefully make it 
as enjoyable as possible.

775
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,540
Bye. Thanks for playing.

00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,940

777
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,300
It's really good.

He doesn't mean that.

783
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,736
He's going to say something really mean.

784
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,340
It's not as good as Iron Brigade.

785
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,300
OK. Cool.

786
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,040
Awesome.
