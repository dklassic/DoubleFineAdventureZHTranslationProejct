1
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,180
Schafer: Mmm, my new notebook.

2
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,575
did you notice I brought my 
old and my new notebooks?

3
00:00:39,395 --> 00:00:41,663
Can you believe I filled this up?

4
00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:46,287
Remember? This old notebook.

5
00:00:46,287 --> 00:00:47,682
It's all full.

6
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:50,921
Now there's the design for 
the last shot in the game.

7
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:53,239
Can't show you, 
you guys always use those.

8
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:54,400
So yeah, this is the new notebook.

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,014
And this is kind of a 
disaster first, because this,

10
00:00:56,014 --> 00:01:01,996
I didn't notice until I started it, it's 
wide ruled, instead of college rule.

11
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,736
And this game is 
definitely college level.

12
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:06,433
But I decided actually this will make 
me feel like we got a lot more work done,

13
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:10,024
'cause my free writing 
will fill up more pages.

14
00:01:10,024 --> 00:01:13,733
Yeah, I purposely got white 
so it'd feel pristine and fresh.

15
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:15,540
It's smaller

16
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,345
This is like totally 
like a baby notebook.

17
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:19,968
It does! It makes me 
look stupid, doesn't it?

18
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:23,849
But then again, I'm getting 
older so it's hard to see stuff.

19
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:25,149
New notebook.

20
00:01:26,593 --> 00:01:51,473
[Music]

21
00:01:53,651 --> 00:01:55,112
Schafer: Yeah. Let's talk about stuff.

22
00:01:55,112 --> 00:01:56,629
We shipped Red's last week.

23
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:58,120
I don't know if you guys noticed 
that, we shipped a game.

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,180
It was awesome.

25
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,040
Yay, Red's.

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,040
[Applause]

27
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,283
It has, it has, it has made about 
$800,000 so far on the old Steam thing,

28
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:09,772
which is fun.

29
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,415
And that's not a big enough 
number that we're going to be

30
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:17,582
immediately completely independent 
of publishers this year,

31
00:02:17,582 --> 00:02:20,169
like was a secret, back 
of my head kind of hope.

32
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:22,371
Where all my hopes are 
in the back of my head.

33
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:28,806
It's a little, it's a little tricky financially 
because, pretty much, you know,

34
00:02:28,806 --> 00:02:30,439
I think conservatively 
we would estimate that

35
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:33,234
we've made most of the money 
that we're going to make off of it.

36
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:35,905
We might make more when we release 
Part Two, but it's not going to be equal.

37
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,341
It's not going to be like 
the equal amount of sales.

38
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:43,823
So we're working on something that is, 
we're usually working on something like,

39
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:45,930
oh, when this, when we release it, 
it'll make a bunch of money for us

40
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,280
and that'll pay for more 
stuff and so we already got,

41
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,621
or kind of got that 
money in advance twice.

42
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:52,721
Offscreen Voice: So you're making a bigger,

43
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:55,230
more complex game that you 
know isn't going to sell as well?

44
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,185
Schafer: Yeah. Yep. Just from love.

45
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:01,616
This time it's just for love.

46
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:03,919
That's our slogan.

47
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,019
The money is gone, now 
we're just running on love.

48
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,345
No, I mean, the first 
part made enough money.

49
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:13,879
It definitely made its numbers.

50
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:18,153
I mean, it was, we went through 
these phases of like let's, let's estimate,

51
00:03:18,153 --> 00:03:20,761
you know, conservatively, 
because it's an adventure game

52
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:25,539
and you know, we had a conservative 
estimate for it, how much it would sell.

53
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,316
Schafer: Everyone think in your head, 
how many units this game is going to sell.

54
00:03:29,316 --> 00:03:30,940
How many do you 
think it's going to sell?

55
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,933
Rice: A million.

56
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,185
Schafer: A million?

57
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:34,665
How many you think's going to sell?

58
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:38,616
Bailey: 150,000 year one.

59
00:03:38,616 --> 00:03:39,763
Schafer: What do you say?

60
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:42,956
Stamos: I was going to say 200, 
but I was thinking more lifetime.

61
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:47,221
Schafer: So let's say it was 300.

62
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:49,943
And then somewhere along the line we 
got really excited about people's response

63
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:53,363
to it and excited by the game 
itself and how much we liked it.

64
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:56,959
And you can see this, you know, 
part of us were like, hey now,

65
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,837
if this does really, really well, 
it might change a lot of stuff for us.

66
00:03:59,837 --> 00:04:03,744
Stoddard: A lot of people here kind of 
hang on because like, they know,

67
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,904
they know Tim, they know, 
they know the management,

68
00:04:06,904 --> 00:04:11,059
they know the vision and if 
it hits, it'll, it'll be really good.

69
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:12,029
It'll be really good.

70
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:15,831
So we're just hanging in.

71
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:17,451
Schafer: And you could 
see that in like Camden.

72
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:20,683
I think Camden was like a lot of 
people were, kind of hoping for it.

73
00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:21,995
And it didn't sell that much.

74
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:25,138
It didn't sell so much that it changed 
our whole business plan for the year.

75
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:27,750
It sold what we kind 
of estimated originally.

76
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,491
Schafer: So far it's made about 1.6 million 
dollars on Steam, which is awesome.

77
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:34,563
And it's, by, that's about 
70,000 people purchased it;

78
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:36,465
about 80,000 were the backers.

79
00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:39,048
So that's about 150,000 units out there.

80
00:04:39,048 --> 00:04:42,566
Schafer: And so that's, I don't want be 
too sad about it [inaudible 00:04:41].

81
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:45,888
Just a little part of me 
was like, what if, you know,

82
00:04:45,888 --> 00:04:47,965
it's always part of you that 
hopes what if something really,

83
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:52,601
like a big, you know, outlier 
thing is just crazy, hits.

84
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:54,723
It just unexpectedly, 
like our Kickstarter.

85
00:04:54,723 --> 00:04:56,354
Once you have an experience like that,

86
00:04:56,354 --> 00:05:00,001
it's hard to go back to the normal world 
where things sell what you expect them to.

87
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:02,890
Bailey: One thing I am a little 
interested in, I'm not, not sure,

88
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,461
is that, you know, we just don't have, 
we're not doing any marketing.

89
00:05:05,461 --> 00:05:08,014
We're not spending 
any money on marketing.

90
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:09,768
And one thing I'm just looking 
at is to get around that, you know,

91
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:13,311
we do a lot of press 
presence, a lot of social media.

92
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:19,607
We rely upon features on the distributors, 
in this case with Steam and Valve.

93
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:23,502
But it's like what, how much 
does banner ads help?

94
00:05:23,502 --> 00:05:25,978
And you know, those other 
traditional forms of marketing.

95
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:27,848
And it is something I'd like 
to look at in the future,

96
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:30,357
'cause that will be the 
one thing I think publishers

97
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:32,947
have done different 
than we haven't done.

98
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:35,328
I think, any of our fans want us 
to be successful commercially.

99
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:37,602
This whole thing is 
for naught if, you know,

100
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:40,675
if we don't come out of it able to be 
more independent and then, you know,

101
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:44,447
be able to create more 
creative works independently.

102
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:47,819
So you know, I think we need 
to take that into consideration

103
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:50,225
when we come up with 
our, our plans for Act Two.

104
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,877
Maybe we're really lucky to 
have split the game in two,

105
00:05:52,877 --> 00:05:55,672
because then it gets some more chances.

106
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:59,431
And then we have more platforms coming 
up, so yeah, I think it will be good.

107
00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:04,405
Schafer: We are. Yeah, so that's 
just to finish the whole Red's update.

108
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,667
What the team is working on now is 
a lot of, instead of diving into Part Two,

109
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,070
is actually platform work.

110
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:15,470
You get it out on more platforms, to sell 
it on like IOS and the other platforms.

111
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:22,595
Schafer: Sooner than we had previously 
thought we were going to do it.

112
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:25,283
Schafer: The sales of the game make it 
look like the people who bought the game

113
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:27,613
are people who played 
adventure games before.

114
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:29,802
It seems like we found those people.

115
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:31,506
But we haven't quite 
gotten yet to all the people

116
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:33,166
who've never played 
adventure games before.

117
00:06:35,971 --> 00:06:39,857
Rice: The idea was while we were waiting 
for design and writing for Act Two stuff,

118
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:44,591
that we can try and jump on some 
of these platform work to fill time.

119
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:48,804
And potentially even move forward 
some of those platform releases.

120
00:06:48,804 --> 00:06:50,341
Kipnis: Hi, we have 
some questions for you.

121
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:51,837
Rice: We do have a 
pressing question for you.

122
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:53,393
Schafer: There's a lot of work 
that Oliver has to get done

123
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:55,371
before the iPad version can come out.

124
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:58,033
But that's a version I'm waiting for.

125
00:06:58,033 --> 00:06:59,922
Well, all of them, 
waiting for all of them.

126
00:06:59,922 --> 00:07:01,802
Hansen: From a studio standpoint 
the most important thing

127
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:03,195
is still the platform work,

128
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:06,857
because we want to make sure that we 
can get the ports out as soon as possible.

129
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:08,580
Franzke: Right.

130
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,165
Franzke: And yeah, it's 
been going pretty well.

131
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:15,165
It's just, you know, it's a lot of work, 
just kind of looking at those platforms

132
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:19,069
and seeing kind of how is 
the game performing on that

133
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:22,229
and what other kind 
of very specific issues.

134
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:26,023
Schafer: It's awesome.

135
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:27,369
So I get to keep this, right?

136
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:30,415
Franzke: Also just generally us 
getting the infrastructure in place to,

137
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:33,165
to kind of launch games 
on those platforms.

138
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:37,135
Very often, you know, 
different storefronts require,

139
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:40,135
have different requirements when 
it comes how you deliver the product.

140
00:07:40,135 --> 00:07:43,446
You know, it's very different delivering 
something to Google Play store

141
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:47,918
versus the iOS app store versus the 
Mac app store and things like that.

142
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:53,364
So there'll a whole bunch of infrastructure 
things that we need to put in place.

143
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:56,296
And so I've been working on those a lot.

144
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:59,483
So as you can, there's still 
some stuff that's broken.

145
00:07:59,483 --> 00:08:03,022
For example, some invalid textures 
here and there that shouldn't be there.

146
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:04,791
I need to investigate what's going on.

147
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,875
You should be able to play through 
the game from the beginning to end,

148
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,388
which is huge.

149
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:16,467
But as you can see, you know, the game, 
the game runs and I would even have sound.

150
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:19,858
[Sound from iPad]

151
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:23,785
Franzke: Oh, great. All right.

152
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:24,625
Offscreen Voice: I mean, traditionally,

153
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:28,748
like port houses handle moving 
stuff to different platforms.

154
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:32,402
So like why do it internally and 
not just hand it off to someone?

155
00:08:32,402 --> 00:08:36,541
Franzke: Because the intrinsic 
goal for an external port house

156
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,864
is different than what 
our intrinsic goal is.

157
00:08:38,864 --> 00:08:41,913
For a port house, it's like, 
well, our contract says

158
00:08:41,913 --> 00:08:44,091
we have to get it done for this 
platform, for this amount of money.

159
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:48,010
So we will employ any hack that 
we can think of to make this work.

160
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,181
Like, we'll, like essentially 
you're throwing out any,

161
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:57,840
any kind of way of like clean software
development is the first thing that goes.

162
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,071
And that's OK as a developer,

163
00:09:01,071 --> 00:09:04,395
if it's a product that's done and 
you're never going to touch it again

164
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:07,778
and you get the code back and 
you just archive it and that's it.

165
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:11,588
But if it's something that you 
will have to work with in the future,

166
00:09:11,588 --> 00:09:13,357
you don't want to do that.

167
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,541
Franzke: I don't know.

168
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,924
Criticism makes me always smile.

169
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:30,866
Franzke: We'll find out.

170
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:33,639
Let's hope so, right?

171
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,018
Schafer: I made it for the 
hardcore fans, only the hardcore fans.

172
00:09:37,018 --> 00:09:38,402
I was only thinking of the hardcore fans

173
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:40,770
and I hate everyone 
who's not a hardcore fan.

174
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,065
Someone came up to me at PAX and 
was like, hey, I really like Broken Age.

175
00:09:44,065 --> 00:09:46,232
It seemed really short, though.

176
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:48,355
It seemed like they cared 
more about getting Elijah Wood

177
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,326
than putting money into puzzles.

178
00:09:50,326 --> 00:09:52,658
It's like, first of all, 
who are you saying "they"?

179
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,451
That's me.

180
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:57,611
And that's not how the 
money worked on the project.

181
00:09:57,611 --> 00:10:00,606
Go and, oh why am I talking to you?

182
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:02,915
Schafer: [High pitched voice] 
I was disappointed in your game.

183
00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:04,199
I just wanted you to know.

184
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:05,727
Schafer: You have a good point.

185
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:07,211
I should quit the games industry.

186
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:13,405
Schafer: Yay! You fans.

187
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,083
I am excited about all the 
things you're asking me about.

188
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,772
I am really, I am excited 
about coming on the iPad.

189
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:21,588
I'm hoping people who have 
never played adventure games

190
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,990
will give it a shot 
and like it and play it.

191
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,045
But we didn't, you know, 
dumb the game down for them.

192
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:29,984
We just made it the 
way we wanted to make it.

193
00:10:29,984 --> 00:10:32,001
Offscreen Voice: How much time 
do you have left to work on this?

194
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:35,722
'Cause it seems like people are 
starting to roll back into Broken Age.

195
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:36,874
Franzke: Yes. Yeah.

196
00:10:36,874 --> 00:10:40,132
I mean, this is the other thing that's 
always been happening right now.

197
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:45,442
We're kind of also working on starting 
to work on Act Two, which is nice.

198
00:10:45,442 --> 00:10:46,856
Schafer: Let's talk about Red's.

199
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,233
Remember Red's, it's not done yet.

200
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,583
Part One is up.

201
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,225
Part Two we got to do now.

202
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:52,231
Schafer: That was crazy.

203
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:54,931
I've never, would never have done anything 
like that where we shipped something

204
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:58,577
and then immediately, 
except for like Kinect Party.

205
00:10:58,577 --> 00:11:01,031
But I've never had to go back
into a game after finishing it.

206
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:04,756
Usually like, I finish the game and 
I immediately like look away from it

207
00:11:04,756 --> 00:11:07,863
and just walk off into the 
desert and never look at it again.

208
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:10,068
Until like ten years later 
or something like that.

209
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:11,534
Schafer: Well, we're so 
used to like shipping a game

210
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:13,849
and then mentally your brain 
starts to heal and close off,

211
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:17,559
like, it's like you would 
like, like you have a baby.

212
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:20,605
You know how it is when 
you guys have a baby, right?

213
00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:23,786
You like, and then your body starts, 
all right, let's pretend that never happened.

214
00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:25,098
Let's just heal up, umm.

215
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:29,098
But no. It's like, there's twins.

216
00:11:29,098 --> 00:11:30,277
There's another one coming.

217
00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:32,472
Rice: Yay, twins.

218
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:35,571
Schafer: And so, normally I 
would just be like, OK, that's done.

219
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:36,610
You know, what's next?

220
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,722
But it's like, oh yeah, 
there's a whole other part of

221
00:11:38,722 --> 00:11:41,267
the meaty part of the story 
that we have to get into.

222
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:45,024
Like explaining all the crazy 
stuff that happened in Act One.

223
00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:48,044
Schafer: And Lee, you're still on, 
you're still working on it or you're?

224
00:11:48,044 --> 00:11:50,194
Petty: You seem surprised.

225
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:51,830
Schafer: I just know you're in demand.

226
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,230
Petty: You're in the office?

227
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,598
Petty: Here's all Act 
Two's threads I started.

228
00:11:54,598 --> 00:11:57,325
So these are all some of the 
concepts works we've been doing.

229
00:11:57,325 --> 00:12:00,508
So you can see some of them are 
revisiting characters or like changes

230
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:05,193
to recurring characters or scene 
modifications from Act One, new props.

231
00:12:05,193 --> 00:12:07,498
Or here's, here's like a 
puzzles one, you know.

232
00:12:07,498 --> 00:12:12,120
Curtis is now into metal 
working so he had all these,

233
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,231
he needed a table in his room.

234
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:15,605
So we were trying to figure 
out the positioning of the table

235
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:16,830
and what they needed to do

236
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,817
and Tim was like, yeah, that looks too 
useful with all those tongs on there.

237
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:21,798
Get rid of the tongs.

238
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:22,889
And hey, those guys are too far apart.

239
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:24,177
They can't be in a cut scene together.

240
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,374
So I'm like, oh, 
what I'm hearing is like,

241
00:12:25,374 --> 00:12:27,519
yeah, that's great but now 
they're blocking the molds.

242
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,833
So put them here and here.

243
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,811
So we're kind of like,
I'm trying to just work through

244
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:34,186
as much as that as fast as possible 
without having to program anything.

245
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,978
And I mentioned story beats

246
00:12:35,978 --> 00:12:39,114
so Bagel's did a lot of these early 
on as he kind of went through that.

247
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:41,027
Yeah, so a lot of this 
stuff is just like, you know,

248
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,941
we're both kind of working on different 
aspects of the same thing, you know.

249
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:46,295
Just kind of like print a breakdown, 
what the characters might be doing.

250
00:12:46,295 --> 00:12:50,115
I was trying to breakdown what changes to 
the space and puzzles would have on that.

251
00:12:50,115 --> 00:12:53,966
Schafer: Right now on the project I think 
our animators are all out in the field,

252
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:56,620
free-ranging across 
the company, helping out.

253
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,878
But our programmers are still on

254
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:02,021
and we're going to meet today 
with anyone who's still around

255
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:05,400
to talk about the puzzles for 
Act Two and get that kicked off.

256
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,268
Schafer: Welcome, everybody.

257
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:08,322
Thank you for coming and 
still being on the Red's team,

258
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:10,429
even though we shipped some of it.

259
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:11,848
Kipnis: Unlike some people.

260
00:13:11,848 --> 00:13:14,459
Petty: Yeah, I'm like, 
Schafer: What is wrong with the artists?

261
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,020
Johnny-come-lately's.

262
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,441
Petty: That's not everybody at all.

263
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:18,441
Schafer: Johnny-leave-early's.

264
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:19,320
Kipnis: Johnny-leave-early's.

265
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,300
Schafer: Those people who do 
what we've asked them to do

266
00:13:26,349 --> 00:13:28,928
Schafer: So we could get this 
design all straightened away

267
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:32,286
and start implementing it, 
Franzke: We're done?

268
00:13:32,286 --> 00:13:33,444
Schafer: And then we're done, right?

269
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:34,715
I don't even know if there's a schedule.

270
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:36,758
We have a schedule?

271
00:13:36,758 --> 00:13:39,024
But we'll probably have a better 
schedule after we get this design all,

272
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:40,804
actually tasked away.

273
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:41,604
Petty: Well, yeah.

274
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:45,144
I mean, I think the high level picture 
hasn't really changed in a long time.

275
00:13:45,798 --> 00:13:47,305
You know, even before 
we finished Act One,

276
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:49,635
I think the high level 
picture was still the same.

277
00:13:49,635 --> 00:13:51,888
Yeah, it's like story beats 
from a long time ago.

278
00:13:51,888 --> 00:13:54,350
And he and I have talked 
about it on a high level.

279
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,567
So I don't think that's changed, 
but a lot of the very specific puzzles

280
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:01,644
or cut scenes haven't 
been designed or written yet.

281
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:03,970
And some of that has changed 
since Act One, you know.

282
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,993
So I think Tim took the feedback of a

283
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:09,724
lot of people wanting 
a more challenging game.

284
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:13,947
Schafer: So how much harder are we 
going to make the second half of the game?

285
00:14:13,947 --> 00:14:16,557
Franzke: Much harder. 
Schafer: Much harder?

286
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,779
Schafer: Every once in a 
while I design something,

287
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,889
like there's no way anyone 
would ever get, OK, let's put that in.

288
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:26,367
Kipnis: You want hard?

289
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:28,142
We'll give you hard.

290
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:29,345
Franzke: We're going to give you hard.

291
00:14:29,345 --> 00:14:30,838
Schafer: Well, it did seem trying to 
reconcile people complaining about

292
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,733
the difficulty with how 
it felt in play-testing

293
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:36,311
when like people weren't 
getting out of the train thing.

294
00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:38,459
And like, 'cause it 
was a reaction to like

295
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,851
how miserable people appeared 
to be when they were stuck.

296
00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:44,927
Kipnis: Yeah, someone, someone made
a post on the forum that was really astute

297
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:50,507
about how a lot of the difficulty that the
old adventure games had was obfuscation.

298
00:14:50,507 --> 00:14:55,970
Like the fact that you had like ten verbs
and you had like 20,000 items made it

299
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,480
seem a lot harder than if it was, you know,
a more limited choice or whatever.

300
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,916
Franzke: And no Internet.

301
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,510
Kipnis: Yeah, and no Internet, exactly.

302
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,870
Franzke: No, seriously. 
Schafer: Yeah.

303
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,918
and no real play testing.

304
00:15:06,918 --> 00:15:08,510
Some play-testing, but not like we did.

305
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,813
We've kind of gone for 
like slicker, slicker inventory.

306
00:15:10,813 --> 00:15:12,773
And we did that over the course 
of those adventure games, too.

307
00:15:12,773 --> 00:15:15,151
Like Throttle had like 
a very small inventory

308
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:17,465
and of course people said 
that was too easy and short.

309
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:18,686
There you go.

310
00:15:18,686 --> 00:15:20,936
Schafer: I mean, would we want to add
another row to the inventory because of that?

311
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:22,538
Would we want to have 
a double stack inventory?

312
00:15:22,538 --> 00:15:25,729
Like Vella shrinks down and 
then Shay can carry her around?

313
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:30,589
And you can open her up 
and get her inventory. Whoa.

314
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:33,948
I'm trying to just, just general good 
design stuff is watching out for things

315
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:36,860
where you find a solution 
before you find a problem.

316
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,641
And you know, I mean I was 
trying to find those in Act One, too.

317
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:45,154
But some things you 
just never, are not clear.

318
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:49,205
Well, let me fly through this and 
then we can just highlight some things

319
00:15:49,205 --> 00:15:50,743
to come back to later.

320
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:54,200
Well, there's some like challenges
I'm trying to achieve with the second act,

321
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,684
like the interaction 
between Shay and Vella.

322
00:15:56,684 --> 00:15:59,520
Maybe not in direct interaction, 
but more relevance of the

323
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,852
switching back and forth, 
making that more relevant.

324
00:16:02,852 --> 00:16:06,630
Even if it's just information that 
passes back and forth in your brain.

325
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:12,589
And I'm really thinking about how to 
wrap up the character arcs in the end,

326
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:14,643
'cause mostly with adventure 
games you have a story

327
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:17,383
but you tend to think about the progress
of the story as being the puzzles.

328
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:21,281
And I solve a whole bunch of puzzles and
then they win, do you know what I mean?

329
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,276
Whereas if you're writing a 
movie you'd be thinking about

330
00:16:23,276 --> 00:16:27,457
the total ups and downs these 
characters are going through.

331
00:16:27,457 --> 00:16:30,722
And so I'm focusing a lot more on that,
'cause I really want it to be satisfying,

332
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:34,089
how the characters end up in the end.

333
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:36,981
Not just they achieved all their small 
goals and add it to one big goal,

334
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:41,409
but they actually had a moment of 
you know, some real lows and highs

335
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:45,179
and that the ending actually meant 
something to the characters.

336
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:46,913
Hopefully.

337
00:16:46,913 --> 00:16:50,230
But it's easy to get distracted by 
the mechanics of solving puzzles

338
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,506
and think that the story
is kind of resolving.

339
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:55,417
And the "A" plot does 
resolve in adventure games.

340
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:59,241
Like your action plot resolves because 
the character achieves their goals,

341
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:04,291
but the "B" plot's like the emotional 
plot often, it's kind of left.

342
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,810
Where it's summed up
by the two characters

343
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,803
kissing at the end 
or something like that.

344
00:17:07,804 --> 00:17:11,990
But to have actually sum up in a 
meaningful way for the characters

345
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,810
is something I have to do.

346
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,620
Schafer: The game?

347
00:17:19,382 --> 00:17:21,827
Schafer: May? No.

348
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:26,502
I really am trying everything to make 
sure the game comes out this year.

349
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:27,850
And then people always go what?

350
00:17:27,851 --> 00:17:31,445
And then I say, the 
first act took two years.

351
00:17:31,445 --> 00:17:37,333
And so if the second act can take 
less than one year, it's a miracle.

352
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,553
And that's what we're doing.

353
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,470
Rice: If the directive is we want 
to ship by the end of the year,

354
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,022
I think we've talked a lot about like 
things that would need to happen

355
00:17:46,407 --> 00:17:47,765
to make that doable,

356
00:17:47,765 --> 00:17:52,245
to like where if we timeboxed
a scheduled to December,

357
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:55,183
we'd still have to do some 
stuff to pull it in a little bit.

358
00:17:55,183 --> 00:17:58,420
I think that's the conversation 
that we need to have, I guess.

359
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,895
'Cause if not, like it's 
going to be very easy

360
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:05,570
to just keep pushing stuff 
back like we did on Act One.

361
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:09,302
Schafer: Well, the two big reasons,
two of the big reasons are, or three,

362
00:18:09,302 --> 00:18:11,518
there's like backer 
expectations because they,

363
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:14,239
a lot of people thought it was going to 
come out like two months after Act One.

364
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:17,166
So that message thing that we 
kind of have to get out to people.

365
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,985
Like a couple people I've talked to,
it's like I hope it's coming out this year,

366
00:18:19,985 --> 00:18:22,197
so there's like that.

367
00:18:22,197 --> 00:18:27,030
There is financial, just that Justin 
has been working with December

368
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,809
in all his financial planning, you know.

369
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:31,045
So that's a pretty hard thing.

370
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:34,360
Rice: Yeah, both for getting profit 
in and for spending on the project.

371
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,206
Schafer: Yeah.

372
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:38,643
And for me, just the possibility 
of actually being up for awards

373
00:18:38,643 --> 00:18:40,586
because we shipped 
the first half this year.

374
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:44,941
So we're either going to 
be not eligible for 2014 awards

375
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:50,409
or really coming out in 
January or March of 2015,

376
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:53,135
when everyone will forget about it 
by the time the '15 awards come out.

377
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:54,773
So there's that.

378
00:18:54,773 --> 00:18:57,402
Rice: I think those are all the right
reasons and all the reasons that I feel like

379
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:00,659
everyone I've talked to about this 
wants to really make December happen,

380
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:06,381
but I think that it's, it's just going 
in knowing that that would mean like,

381
00:19:06,381 --> 00:19:08,731
doing whatever it takes 
to make that happen.

382
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,834
And sacrificing in some ways.

383
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:13,935
Petty: It's possible. It's possible.

384
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:18,095
You know, most video game 
productions are a series of bottlenecks.

385
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:20,522
And trying to get everything 
unblocked with minimal bottlenecks

386
00:19:20,522 --> 00:19:24,056
is what's going to 
make or break December.

387
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:26,117
Although the other problem with 
December is there's a lot of unknowns

388
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:28,646
as it comes to puzzle 
playability and testing.

389
00:19:28,646 --> 00:19:31,537
So we can take certain steps, like we
can try and work through earlier versions

390
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,439
or script early versions and test them,

391
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,956
but you know, ultimately 
that's the fun factor

392
00:19:35,956 --> 00:19:38,919
and that's a little hard to 
know how that's going to hit.

393
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:41,786
And when you don't leave 
yourself a lot of iteration time,

394
00:19:41,786 --> 00:19:45,329
it may not be enough 
and you don't really know.

395
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:47,017
Schafer: I think we can do December.

396
00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:49,524
To me it's like an infinity far away.

397
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:53,379
I always think we can do anything.

398
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:56,411
That's why my games are sometimes late.

399
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:58,646
Schafer: It's really just the best game 
that we can make and we feel like

400
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:01,862
we can actually make without crashing 
the company into the ground.

401
00:20:01,862 --> 00:20:04,072
And they also just want 
to finish it because it's,

402
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:06,203
while it's fresh in people's minds.

403
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:08,837
And I do want to get the team 
back and there's a pressure to

404
00:20:08,837 --> 00:20:11,010
keep them on other projects because 
they have these publisher milestones.

405
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,689
And publisher milestones are always 
scarier than internal milestones,

406
00:20:13,689 --> 00:20:16,645
because there's no 
outside force threatening to

407
00:20:16,645 --> 00:20:19,749
not pay you if you 
don't meet the milestones.

408
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:22,584
So we have to be that 
threatening outside force.

409
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:25,582
Can you make some phone calls from 
outside the building with a funny voice?

410
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:26,641
Hansen: I can.

411
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,663
Schafer: And be like, 
we won't pay you guys

412
00:20:28,663 --> 00:20:31,183
if you don't meet your 
milestones on this project.

413
00:20:31,183 --> 00:20:33,123
Hansen: I'm pretty sure
they're going to figure out that it's me.

414
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:36,393
Schafer: Well, that's the 
other big factor, right.

415
00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:39,336
Is we went to this smaller team, 
which I think from a budget standpoint

416
00:20:39,336 --> 00:20:41,327
was a good idea, 
'cause you were writing.

417
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:44,239
Bagel and I could do some 
early concept work and stuff.

418
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:46,981
If we were working from a no, 
this is the target deadline,

419
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:48,549
that is not a good way to work.

420
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:50,913
If it's a, this is our target budget

421
00:20:50,913 --> 00:20:53,552
and so we're lowering the 
berm while we figure stuff out.

422
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:57,585
But if we were like, no, this is an 
unmovable time here in December,

423
00:20:57,585 --> 00:20:59,801
then we should have, 
I mean this is in hindsight,

424
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,390
but we probably should have 
tried to get more of the team

425
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,352
and start full production like 
right after AF or something.

426
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:07,986
Hansen: Yeah, but we couldn't have.

427
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:11,861
There wasn't enough design 
to execute on at that point.

428
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:13,761
Petty: Perhaps. 
But I mean, I'm just, you know,

429
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:15,703
that's, I think it's just 
one of the other factors,

430
00:21:15,703 --> 00:21:18,270
I think, is that it felt good to 
have a small team for a while,

431
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,502
while we sort of like could 
digest some of these things

432
00:21:20,502 --> 00:21:21,958
and Oliver was working on a platform.

433
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,775
But it did sort of put this maybe 
end date a little bit in jeopardy.

434
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:26,326
Team Member: That's very true.

435
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,371
Schafer: So maybe Oliver's 
stuff will make so much money

436
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:31,089
we can have more time to make Act Two.

437
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,125
Rice: It sounds like we're not going 
to have more time, though, right?

438
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,261
It sounds like we could have more money 
to throw at the problem and put...

439
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:40,181
Schafer: Oh yeah. Maybe that will make 
more, we'll buy some more people.

440
00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:46,976
Franzke: Yeah. It works pretty well.

441
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:51,336
I'm overall, like pretty happy 
with how it turned out.

442
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:53,376
The load times aren't terrible.

443
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:57,576
You know, we were able to get a 
lot of visual fidelity out of the game.

444
00:21:57,576 --> 00:22:02,300
You know, essentially making 
it look as good as on PC,

445
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,989
which I'm pretty happy about.

446
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,809
So if I go on the app store.

447
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:10,828
What is cool, is like obviously if you
go to games, it's right there, Broken Age.

448
00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:13,296
It's also in Best New 
Games, which is nice.

449
00:22:13,296 --> 00:22:16,441
And that seems to be trending 
pretty well also in the charts.

450
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:19,968
So I would say overall, so far it's 
been a really successful launch.

451
00:22:19,968 --> 00:22:22,811
Schafer: Last night I spent unknown 
hours playing through Broken Age

452
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:26,109
and I'm so glad I did but I didn't 
know I was going to end unfinished.

453
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:28,109
Uh oh.

454
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:32,445
We don't really call it 
Part One on the app store.

455
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:36,672
I should say Part, should I say, 
does this guy say Part Two coming soon.

456
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:38,066
Should I say "soon"?

457
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,655
If children love this as much as 
Day of the Tentacle or Psychonauts,

458
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:43,121
then please mark me as 
fuddy-duddy and ignore me.

459
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:44,588
OK, where do I do that?

460
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:45,958
It was like no game I've ever played.

461
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,538
It doesn't glitch or crash.

462
00:22:49,095 --> 00:22:51,596
The story is great and 
I can't wait for Act Two.

463
00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:52,394
Two stars.

464
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:53,577
Not as advertised.

465
00:22:53,577 --> 00:22:58,172
This game says ages 9 through 11
and that's about all I think would be fun for.

466
00:22:58,172 --> 00:22:59,539
Oh, and the fake train wreck?

467
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:00,969
Why are we doing this 
over and over again?

468
00:23:00,969 --> 00:23:03,066
The kid actually says he'd 
rather jump off a cliff

469
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:04,573
than do it again or something like that.

470
00:23:04,573 --> 00:23:05,778
That's how I feel as well.

471
00:23:05,778 --> 00:23:07,092
Please refund.

472
00:23:07,092 --> 00:23:09,112
There's no way this 
game is worth the price.

473
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:15,825
I think he' stuck on the train.

474
00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:18,325
So maybe that wasn't too easy after all.

475
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:22,991
Anyway. Overall it's really good.

476
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,700
On the iPad.

477
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,221
Schafer: Very happy with the iPad launch.

478
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,300
I'm good.

479
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:31,010
Franzke: I think we will know in a 
few days, kind of from some of our

480
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:35,169
third-party tools that send us
information about app sales.

481
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:38,489
But yeah, fingers crossed.

482
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:43,415
Bailey: So moving on, Broken Age did
decent sales on iPhone.

483
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,400
Stamos: iPad.

484
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,727
Bailey: iPad, sorry.

485
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,720
Decent enough that we're 
looking into doing iPhone

486
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,100
and potentially android tablets with it.

487
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,591
So that was good.

488
00:23:53,591 --> 00:23:54,875
It's meeting forecasts.

489
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:58,355
It's not like a runaway hit, 
but it's, you know, it's good.

490
00:23:58,355 --> 00:23:59,735
It's decent cash flow.

491
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,500
So the numbers right now are 
about 100,000 for, you know, four days.

492
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:07,498
So expect for the actual feature week, 
while I'd say editor's choice,

493
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,450
it'll probably be around 150,000

494
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,142
and then it'll probably go down about 
one-fourth of that for the next week,

495
00:24:13,142 --> 00:24:15,387
while it's as a 
previous editor's choice.

496
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,707
So yeah, decent, decent numbers.

497
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,623
Bailey: So it was received well.

498
00:24:19,623 --> 00:24:25,391
It looks like it's, it's, it's doing what
our expectations were sales-wise.

499
00:24:25,772 --> 00:24:28,548
Offscreen Voice: Expectations?

500
00:24:28,548 --> 00:24:30,282
Bailey: Yeah, I mean you 
can expect, you know,

501
00:24:30,282 --> 00:24:34,382
about 100 to $150,000 is 
what I expect out of a week

502
00:24:34,382 --> 00:24:38,941
for an iOS game that's a 
content-based game. Yeah.

503
00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:41,677
Schafer: I think he was telling me 
they performed to his expectations.

504
00:24:41,677 --> 00:24:46,172
They met his sales forecast,

505
00:24:46,172 --> 00:24:48,163
but of course forecasts are 
always pretty conservative.

506
00:24:48,163 --> 00:24:51,339
So he's always secretly hoping 
that his sales forecasts are wrong.

507
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:53,919
Bailey: My expectation, just to be 
clear, though, they're more about,

508
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,304
my expectations are more 
reflective of the current market

509
00:24:57,304 --> 00:25:01,010
on like iTunes for premium based games.

510
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,291
And like paid content based games.

511
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:09,391
So it's less of a reflection about the game 
and more a reflection about the market.

512
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:13,566
Schafer: We were at number 
four, now we're at number ten.

513
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:15,139
We might not be number ten anymore,

514
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:19,319
but it was fun to be number 
four for a long time.

515
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:22,804
Well, we finally got pushed off ten.

516
00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:28,123
Let's see how far 
down we are. Twenty-two.

517
00:25:28,123 --> 00:25:30,969
This looks dirty.

518
00:25:30,969 --> 00:25:33,965
Beaten by "Frozen Karaoke".

519
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,803
Schafer: Yeah, I mean, I'm happy 
with the performance on iPad,

520
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:39,776
but I don't think it made a lot of 
extra money that's going to allow us

521
00:25:39,776 --> 00:25:42,655
to like hire another programmer 
and throw him at the team.

522
00:25:42,655 --> 00:25:46,333
So I don't think it's going to 
change the schedule, unfortunately.

523
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:48,272
We can always hope.

524
00:25:48,272 --> 00:25:53,153
I keep promising that I will stop 
hoping for those kind of things,

525
00:25:53,153 --> 00:25:56,481
but it's hard not to think 
about like, what if it was a big hit,

526
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:58,641
then we could totally hire 
a programmer to help finish it.

527
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:04,691
But I don't know.

528
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:07,371
But I'm just happy it made 
enough that we can stay in business.

529
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,840
Bailey: It's just there's no 
magic bullet, basically.

530
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,133
So you know, it's, everything's a 
grind, especially in the game industry.

531
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:20,891
Like, you know, you have to have an 
amazing press and get the feature spots

532
00:26:20,891 --> 00:26:25,246
and get huge VO and have 
amazing polish and then do OK.

533
00:26:25,246 --> 00:26:28,414
But if you didn't have any 
of that stuff, you'd do horrible.

534
00:26:28,414 --> 00:26:33,300
So the, yeah. The hit.

535
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,600
The hit has been, has 
been elusive, for sure.

536
00:26:39,980 --> 00:27:19,272
[Music]

537
00:27:19,272 --> 00:27:21,498
Schafer: What did you guys think of it?

538
00:27:21,498 --> 00:27:24,305
Offscreen Voice: What's that notepad
that says, "the end" on it, right there.

539
00:27:24,305 --> 00:27:26,722
Schafer: Oh. This is how 
things are going to end.

540
00:27:26,722 --> 00:27:33,374
This is the guy who guessed 
that Shay's ship was Mog Chothra.

541
00:27:33,374 --> 00:27:36,379
I'm super happy that no one seemed 
to have guessed the big spoiler

542
00:27:36,379 --> 00:27:37,675
at the end of it.

543
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:39,283
I really thought that 
was going to get out.

544
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:43,774
And actually long ago on 
the forum one guy guessed it.

545
00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:45,606
And no one followed up on it.

546
00:27:45,606 --> 00:27:49,188
Like no one, he just said his little 
thing, hey, what if this is the case?

547
00:27:49,188 --> 00:27:50,876
No one answered him.

548
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:52,682
I was like, oh man.

549
00:27:52,682 --> 00:27:55,928
Schafer: By the way, since I was 
the guy who guessed that, by the way,

550
00:27:55,928 --> 00:28:01,748
here's how I figured out how 
it, how this, why I'm so smart.

551
00:28:01,748 --> 00:28:04,993
And then here's how what I 
think is going to happen in Act Two.

552
00:28:04,993 --> 00:28:06,455
Offscreen Voice: He's done it for you.

553
00:28:06,455 --> 00:28:08,183
Schafer: Yeah. What if I 
get a bunch of ideas from him.

554
00:28:08,183 --> 00:28:11,412
Might be bad.

555
00:28:11,412 --> 00:28:14,859
People send me stuff as if 
I have time to read anything.
