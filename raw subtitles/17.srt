1
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:34,904
Rice: Last week was, I think, 
the Kickstarter update went out.

2
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:39,084
So that went over really well 
and there's a lot of comments about

3
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:41,505
how we all looked 
really sad in that episode.

4
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:43,693
Schafer: Cheer up, you guys!

5
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:47,565
Petty: There were a couple
random cuts of me going;

6
00:00:47,565 --> 00:00:49,398
that had nothing to do
with what was being said.

7
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:51,402
Rice: It just meant that a lot of people
came out of the woodwork that were like,

8
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:53,343
don't be sad, we love the game.

9
00:00:53,343 --> 00:00:54,466
And don't listen to the haters.

10
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:56,879
Kipnis: Wait, wait.
Can you send this link to us?

11
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,697
Rice: Yeah. If you looked at
forum threads, the main forum threads.

12
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:02,897
Schafer: What did you do last week?

13
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:08,221
Fish: Face it, baby.
You're hooked on me.

14
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:11,060
It's even funnier in the game, you guys.

15
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,387
Rice: Spoiler. 
Schafer: Spoilers.

16
00:01:13,387 --> 00:01:38,879
[Music]

17
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,004
Schafer: I really am trying everything to
make sure the game comes out this year.

18
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:44,402
Rice: It's just going in
knowing that that would mean like

19
00:01:44,402 --> 00:01:46,610
doing whatever it takes
to make that happen.

20
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,014
And sacrificing in some ways.

21
00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:50,411
Schafer: I think we can do December.

22
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,331
To me, it's like an infinity far away.

23
00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:53,895
Schafer: There's like
backer expectations.

24
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:55,725
There is a financial.

25
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:58,186
And for me, just the possibility
of actually being up for awards.

26
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:00,788
It's really just the best game
that we can make and we feel like

27
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,496
we can actually make without
crashing the company into the ground.

28
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:05,593
Rice: And so I guess
on the screen right now

29
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:08,787
is the current timeline
for production on Act Two.

30
00:02:08,787 --> 00:02:10,538
This is what we're working towards

31
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:13,828
and this was the attempt
to get to a December launch.

32
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:19,428
So like even this is stuff that is a
real challenge and a lot of people feel,

33
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:24,600
on the team, it's going to take everything,
everyone firing like on all cylinders.

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,530
Everything falling
into the right places.

35
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,800
But seems doable with a push.

36
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,692
And so that is the other challenge,
is that all of this requires like

37
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:38,299
our team coming back and working
in full, having writing ready to go.

38
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:40,321
Schafer: On Broken Age? 
OK, Broken Age.

39
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:42,290
We have people coming back.

40
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,941
Ray's coming back. 
Crook: Tomorrow.

41
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:45,223
Schafer: You're typing something.

42
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:46,411
You're on Facebook over there.

43
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:47,696
Crook: Just with my eyes.

44
00:02:47,696 --> 00:02:48,975
Schafer: Facebooking.

45
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:50,554
Ray's coming back tomorrow.

46
00:02:50,554 --> 00:02:51,845
And Rusty's been back.

47
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:55,469
Anna's been wiring up actual
puzzles in Act Two, right?

48
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:57,439
Crook: Here we go.

49
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,781
Offscreen Voice: Been a while?

50
00:02:58,781 --> 00:03:01,071
Crook: Deja vu. That's good.

51
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:05,620
It's good to be back on, back
in the world of Shay and Vella.

52
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,620
So I took, took a little time off
away from it, not off Double Fine,

53
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,489
but just away from the Broken Age and
helped out on a couple of other projects.

54
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:20,012
And that was great, because
it was just totally different

55
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:22,729
and just a new, it was a nice break.

56
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:24,498
Schafer: Wow, the team is big again.

57
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:25,609
Look at that.

58
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:27,443
And Oliver's working.

59
00:03:27,443 --> 00:03:29,791
Franzke: We're implementing puzzles
and scenes are getting drawn

60
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:34,421
and like sample scripts are getting
written, so it's, it's pretty good.

61
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:39,584
We got Ben back now as well on
the project, which is good, exactly.

62
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:40,933
Peck: Wow. That was a roller coaster,

63
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:45,211
like now we're going to have to do the
whole thing over again in less time.

64
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:48,186
Kipnis: Yeah, I guess at this
point it's one of these things

65
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,516
where we know that we'll
be able to do the game.

66
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:52,516
The matter will be to the
standard that we have in Act One,

67
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:54,365
like that's not a risk however.

68
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:56,313
That's not a concern that we have.

69
00:03:56,313 --> 00:04:00,757
But we just like, now it's like OK,
can we do this in a few months?

70
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:05,198
And we'll see.

71
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:08,078
Hansen: Yeah, we worked through a lot
of the kinks that we experienced during

72
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:11,757
the Act One, so it's really just
about pure execution at this point.

73
00:04:11,757 --> 00:04:13,683
Petty: This wouldn't stay here,
but if you had like everything on,

74
00:04:13,683 --> 00:04:16,343
so they kind of don't overlap each other

75
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:19,122
but they all add up
versus like this stuff.

76
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:20,267
Schafer: Cool. That's neat.

77
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:21,702
Petty: Since it's the only
thing that's really changed,

78
00:04:21,702 --> 00:04:24,597
hopefully it becomes like the player
knows it's a focal point, you know.

79
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,828
They know they need to keep
going back, 'cause it's different.

80
00:04:27,828 --> 00:04:31,214
Peck: I'm pretty excited about how
much of the tech we already have in place

81
00:04:31,214 --> 00:04:34,360
and we can just like
hit the ground running on

82
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,892
just writing up the game
play and stuff like that.

83
00:04:36,892 --> 00:04:39,895
Crook: So that maybe makes
it a little less exciting, in a way,

84
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:43,145
just because it's not new.

85
00:04:43,145 --> 00:04:47,198
As far as figuring things out, but
it also makes you less nervous,

86
00:04:47,198 --> 00:04:50,199
you know, 'cause we know, OK, it worked.

87
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,395
And you know, there's a
few things we want to change.

88
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:55,152
Crook: We really need to
work on the flip book interface.

89
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:57,196
It's not very intuitive.

90
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,389
Another thing.

91
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:01,040
Is there any way, Oliver, I know
we've mentioned this in the past,

92
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,180
but faster exporting of
anims from Maya? Yeah.

93
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:09,980
It's just, you know, it's just these,
this, we have a lot of big scenes.

94
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,240
Tim writes long scenes and
they, and you make one change,

95
00:05:12,244 --> 00:05:14,920
you test it like, ahh, OK, that's good.

96
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,280
Then you got to re-export again,
that's another ten, fifteen minutes.

97
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,740
Franzke: I mean, one thing
I'm interested to investigate

98
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:23,719
is whether we could launch
Maya in batch mode somehow

99
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:24,927
and like execute a script on it.

100
00:05:24,927 --> 00:05:26,887
Petty: I would if we have a
network machine that does it.

101
00:05:26,887 --> 00:05:28,374
Just like when, you know,

102
00:05:28,374 --> 00:05:31,774
in Brutal Legend we eventually
stopped doing local exports of the movie

103
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,135
and started having the
build machine to do it, yeah.

104
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:37,411
It would also help if
we didn't have, you know,

105
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:40,142
seven year old machines
with only 4 gigs of RAM.

106
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:44,010
So it could be fixed by,
you know, I don't know.

107
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,029
Crook: Greg. Buy all new computers.

108
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:49,131
Crook: So it'll, it'll just
make workflow easier.

109
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:54,331
I think it'll save us a
lot of time in bug fixing.

110
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,100
Petty: You know, I noticed that
there are a lot of animation bugs

111
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,872
as the production went on.

112
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,200
And some of those, a lot of those
boil down to like sorting issues.

113
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,460
Crook: Basically one piece of
geometry didn't know whether it

114
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,360
should sort in front or in back
of another piece of geometry.

115
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:12,848
Petty: The way we've done sorting
to support all the platforms is limited

116
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:16,000
and they spend a lot
of time cleaning that up.

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,040
Like if we knew that we were only
making it for a high-end console ever,

118
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,259
we'd probably have
had different solutions

119
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:23,339
that would have removed some of
the burden off the animators or artists,

120
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:26,959
but you know, when you're developing
a new engine and you're supporting

121
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,520
a really wide array of
platforms, you can't really do that.

122
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,140
Or at least it's harder.

123
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:35,045
Franzke: Yeah, gosh.

124
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,560
Petty: What do you think, Oliver?

125
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,380
This is way more fun
that fixing compatibility errors.

126
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,800
Rice: Yep. So I mean, Ben,
you're on some stuff now

127
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,600
and I guess a lot of this
would be coming your way.

128
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Franzke: How do you 
feel about crunching?

129
00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:51,278
Petty: I mean it's always a balance
for every engine I've been on,

130
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:55,238
'cause all the games I've worked on I've
never used commercial licensed engines.

131
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,440
They've always been developed in-house.

132
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,580
So there's always this balance
between getting the game done

133
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,240
and adding tools to make
making the game more effective.

134
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,180
And it's really hard to know
where that balance should be.

135
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,220
Petty: I guess I just wanted to
mention that there's a ball of work

136
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,780
potentially to like fix some
of the workflows that got broken

137
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,320
and also improve some things
that I never got a chance to improve,

138
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,140
to try and also make the content
production of Act Two as efficient as possible.

139
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,760
Franzke: Like, this, this,
this schedule to some degree

140
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,600
also relies in effect
just like in Act One

141
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,080
we actually have some
manpower available to fix

142
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:32,840
and even possibly improve the
workflow, which is right now really bad,

143
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,540
because it just bi-rotted all alway because
nobody had time to really look at it.

144
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,280
Like opening scenes takes insane
amount of time, nobody really knows why.

145
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,080
I don't have time to look into it.

146
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,520
Nobody has, Anna needs to work.

147
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,220
We only have two programmers.

148
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:45,474
Rice: If we're worried about December,
that seems like that's going to be

149
00:07:45,474 --> 00:07:47,896
something that makes
it even more challenging.

150
00:07:47,896 --> 00:07:52,295
Petty: Just something to throw
in the bucket with the rest of it.

151
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:56,395
Petty: And so we're, we're going to a
more traditional production cycle now,

152
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,320
trying to actually build the
very specific game assets,

153
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,558
not just design them, you know.

154
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:02,377
Preproduction way.

155
00:08:02,377 --> 00:08:07,097
And we're finishing our
first sprint of Act Two.

156
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:19,550
[Music]

157
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,380
Schafer: This is the first time we've
played through since we started Act Two.

158
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,200
Kipnis: Although I need to make
sure that the sound is actually working.

159
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,440
Last time on Broken Age.

160
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,693
Schafer: Are we going to have that?

161
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,240
Oh my God. OK. Here we go.

162
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,240
This better not fucking end here!

163
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,900
It better not be the end!

164
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:45,060
I paid $15 for, what?

165
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:51,658
Pull on, OK.

166
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,640
Ohmygod is it going to go
right into it? Awesome.

167
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,140
That's so nice and smooth.

168
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,140
So when you play through
the game, the only thing is like,

169
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,140
do you think we should still put
the text up, like "end of Act One"?

170
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,740
Kipnis: No, no, no.
It should just go right in.

171
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,900
Schafer: You guys seem to have already
come to an agreement about this one.

172
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,500
Kipnis: I mean we could,
but it wouldn't be as...

173
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,600
Schafer: Should I pick the girl?

174
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,760
Kipnis: No. Don't do it.

175
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:18,127
Petty: It'd be a very
short play through.

176
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,400
Schafer: It's like, oh no! Horrible bug.

177
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,354
Kipnis: He needs a runs.

178
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,660
Petty: You know what I realized,
too, is Shay's in all these scenes.

179
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,880
He feels a bit small in all of them.

180
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,740
He's the correct scale, but he's actually,
he's so much smaller feeling than Vella.

181
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,835
Their height is about the same,

182
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,300
but because she has the
bigger hair and a wider face.

183
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,440
Like he looks small talking to the same
characters as if you, like when you just,

184
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,940
and I've doubled, triple checked
the scale and it's all correct.

185
00:09:49,954 --> 00:09:54,154
It just,
Kipnis: I wonder if we should make him bigger.

186
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,120
Petty: Well, it'd throw off
all the stuff at this point.

187
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,700
Schafer: So I assume,
I think Lydia is awkward.

188
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,400
She came 'cause I think she thinks this
is like, yeah, a surprise going away party.

189
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,520
She's coming, is this where, is
this where the cake is, you guys?

190
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,400
Is this where we're
having the big going away?

191
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,040
This is Lydia's last play-through
before she goes to...

192
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,360
That's Oculus. That's my
gesture for Oculus.

193
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,057
Facehugger.

194
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,114
Anyone have any last words for Lydia?

195
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,640
Petty: Thank you for all
your hard work, Lydia.

196
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,640
[Applause]

197
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,600
Kipnis: All your v-effects
in Act One were amazing

198
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,340
and we hope we get somebody anywhere
near as good as you for Act Two.

199
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,500
Crook: Yeah. Yeah, that was unfortunate.

200
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,320
Good old Lydia.

201
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,960
The turnover here is very, is not high.

202
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,020
It's actually, it's not high at all.

203
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:53,660
And I think sometimes we're lucky to
have people for as long as we do.

204
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,360
And it is a little scary, like we were
talking about effects today, a little bit.

205
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,860
Then I was, you know, and then
in the back of your head, like wait.

206
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,039
Who's going to do these?

207
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,920
I know Lee was doing a little
bit of effects work the other day,

208
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,300
but he's not going to have time
to like, be the effects person.

209
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,640
So I'm just going to have to trust
that they can find somebody.

210
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,180
'Cause we do have, we have
a couple other effects artists,

211
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,640
but they're on other projects.

212
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,620
So we're going to have
to find somebody new

213
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,700
that can come in and try and match
that style and we will, we will.

214
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,480
And so, so we'll find
somebody that can do it.

215
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,380
So I'm not freaking
out, but I don't know.

216
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,320
She was great.

217
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,060
Schafer: OK. But it's awesome.

218
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,780
See those puzzles coming together.
Kipnis: Yeah.

219
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,800
Schafer: We'll be done by December!

220
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,080
Rice: Exactly.
Petty: It's nice that you know when...

221
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:47,642
Schafer: This is where everyone
jumps out and is like, yeah!

222
00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:49,757
Schafer: People were worried
about it being done in December,

223
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,900
earlier and then the writing is taking
even a little bit longer than we thought.

224
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,460
So I bet people were even more worried
about it being done in December.

225
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,660
Schafer: But we did
not quite finish the work,

226
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,160
the milestone and
when we started the milestone

227
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,660
we're like, from now
on if we don't finish milestones

228
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,160
we're just going to cut stuff
and when we don't finish them.

229
00:12:08,163 --> 00:12:09,520
And the milestone,

230
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,360
so I guess we're just going to
have to cut half of those puzzles.

231
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,620
So we're going to go
back to that meeting we had

232
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,000
where we said that we're going
to cut stuff and be like, OK, listen.

233
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,940
It's not totally reasonable to just
cut stuff that doesn't get done.

234
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,260
We're going to just have
to make up for it somehow.

235
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,260
Petty: The intent was never to
be, oh, we didn't finish that puzzle.

236
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,416
We're just not doing it.

237
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,940
It was, it was that we didn't
want to leave a wake of unfinished,

238
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,220
half-implemented puzzles
for a variety of reasons

239
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,200
and one was you can't play-test a
half-implemented puzzle meaningfully.

240
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,020
And we wanted to play-test
sooner to help ameliorate

241
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,240
the amount of like play-tested
adjustments at the end

242
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,271
when we have less flexibility,

243
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,540
'cause the dialogue's recorded
and we're running out of time.

244
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,340
So I mean, it's all those reasons
why we're trying to do that.

245
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,880
But what actually wound up
happening for a couple reasons

246
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,540
was that we didn't
hit those two puzzles.

247
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,600
So we're effectively, I don't know, a
week or so behind already on the schedule

248
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,880
in our first two-week sprint.

249
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,480
And it's going to continue, like
we'll continue to get further behind

250
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,740
unless we can close
out puzzles on that sprint.

251
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,880
And I don't see
anything that changes that.

252
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,620
Right now, for example, there's really
only one puzzle that's finished writing.

253
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,680
We can't finish the hull patch
puzzle chain, because it's missing writing.

254
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,240
We can't finish the hexapal
wiring, we can't finish radiation suit.

255
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,200
So that still means we're behind.

256
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,580
Schafer: ok.

257
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,980
Hansen: Would that allow us to potentially
catch up, if we got the writing in time?

258
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,220
Schafer: So I bet I'm
maybe the last person

259
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,160
who thinks we can get it
done in December, probably.

260
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,260
You can kind of sense when you're
in a position where everyone kind of thinks

261
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,820
you're not going to make the deadline,
but they just haven't told you yet.

262
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,940
So I'm going to go ahead and
pretend I haven't heard it yet until they,

263
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,040
it's just too much time has
gone by, they can't tell me.

264
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,640
Then they won't tell me.

265
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,800
And then we'll make it on time, see?

266
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,420
That's how I operate.

267
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,536
Kind of mind games.

268
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,393
Hansen: There're two different
scenarios that we can do pretty much.

269
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,960
Well, one is we don't ship in December.

270
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,980
I mean, that's probably the
one we don't want to go for.

271
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,580
And the other one,
basically eats into Beta periods

272
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,220
so that we won't have a true Beta.

273
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,000
We would actually have
animations and v-effects

274
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,640
and a lot of the audio stuff
coming in late, like into Beta.

275
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,980
And there's a lot of
risk involved in doing that.

276
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,080
So that was something
that we were trying to avoid.

277
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,220
Rice: Then it's like getting the writing
done so we can have a VO session in time

278
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,500
to where we get the files back
soon enough to get our animators

279
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,160
pumping through that from Super Genius,

280
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,400
but also so it's not late,

281
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,660
too late to where we're
screwing audio and the effects guys.

282
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,300
So there's just kind
of a balance in there.

283
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,160
Hansen: We presented Tim with a
really aggressive schedule for delivering

284
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,240
the writing that we needed in
order to keep the team on schedule.

285
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,100
And it was requiring him
to work at a faster pace

286
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,820
than he's ever written on
the projects up to this point.

287
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,880
It's a challenge for everybody,
but it all starts with the writings.

288
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,960
Annable: So Tim, did you
see the email that I sent you

289
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,000
where I said I just
did this little exercise.

290
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,940
Schafer: Yeah, I deleted
that one immediately.

291
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,880
It was terrifying.

292
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,158
That was the one where you were like...

293
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,340
it looks he spent a year
writing this first one, so...

294
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,818
Annable: No, no. And it's, no.
'Cause you didn't take a year;

295
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:21,577
you spent like 13 weeks and
to me, you know, we don't,

296
00:15:21,577 --> 00:15:24,997
we don't really succeed when
we say hey, Tim, write faster.

297
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,998
It's kind of an impossible thing to do.

298
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:36,500
So for me, I just don't see
December as a, as a reality.

299
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,560
Rice: So I don't know if
we want to make a call now

300
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,720
or if we want to say let's
try to write the rest of the game

301
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,540
in four and a half weeks
and still squeeze it in.

302
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,360
Annable: I just worry
about the quality then.

303
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,380
I mean, because even if he,
Tim, even if you locked yourself away

304
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:58,380
and wrote for a month, you know,
I mean that's a lot of pressure.

305
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,840
Schafer: Mmhmm.

306
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,560
Annable: I mean, Tim, do you
think you can do that?

307
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,400
Schafer: Again I don't
see a lot of choice.

308
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,780
Annable: I mean, it'll be a
gnarly schedule for everybody.

309
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,120
Hansen: All right. So why don't
we create those scenarios

310
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,560
and then we can share the, once this
group, and we can talk about it from there.

311
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,520
Schafer: Well, I better get writing. 
Rice: Yeah.

312
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,360
Annable: All right. Whoohoo!
You can do it, Tim. You can do it.

313
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,700
Schafer: OK.
Annable: OK.

314
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,800
Schafer: All right.
Thanks for talking.

315
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,720
I wish I had more easy
solutions for everybody.

316
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,420
Annable: Bye, guys. Schafer: Bye.

317
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,040
Rice: Hi, Malena. OK.

318
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:42,304
I'm getting Bagel, too.

319
00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:43,384
We'll see if he comes.

320
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,380
Tim is not coming today, you guys.

321
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,280
Kipnis: Why not?

322
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,260
Rice: He is in his office with a big
sticker that says "Do Not Disturb".

323
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,120
Melena says.

324
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,220
So he's writing.

325
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,200
No, he's actually, he's been killing it.

326
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,160
He's been cranking
through stuff really quick.

327
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,280
I think he sees the deadlines looming
and is staying really on top of stuff.

328
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,079
So I think if he keeps going
at this pace, then yeah,

329
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,999
we're going to have a good shot at it.

330
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,599
Yeah, he's doing his best
and it's coming in really nice.

331
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,960
It's solid now, so it's good to see.

332
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,560
Schafer: As long as we can survive
'til the end of the project, it'll be great.

333
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,080
I guess I gotta finish
my dialog before...

334
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,559
You guys get to talk to me ever again.

335
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,200
Schafer: Out. Out!

336
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,080
Just kidding.

337
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,920
Come in any time you want to.

338
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,320
Is that a good enough ending?

339
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,040
I'll do like this.

340
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,000
I guess it's just another day in games.

341
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,060
Schafer: Right, right?

342
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,140
I can close my door and I can put a
Post-it note on it and I can even lock it.

343
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,580
But just walking around the
office, people will be like, ah,

344
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,080
I need you to talk, I need to
talk to you about this thing.

345
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,720
And then that thing
spins into another thing.

346
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,220
And someone wants to talk
about another thing.

347
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,640
So many projects going on, so
many deals that I probably should be

348
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,380
helping with and you know, they
justifiably need some input or something.

349
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,720
But I just have to
get this writing done.

350
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,120
I just have to get this writing done.

351
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,960
So everything else
in the company's got to,

352
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,680
got to operate on its
own for a little while.

353
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,740
Schafer: We're here at
the Noe Valley Public Library.

354
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,520
My house is a few blocks down that way.

355
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,900
I've come to libraries ever
since trying to design Full Throttle.

356
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,271
I remember going down to the Sausalito
Library and sitting there and designing.

357
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,559
Sitting there with my
notebook, same exact thing.

358
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,900
And Grim I went
to the library a lot.

359
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,860
I actually did a lot
of research in the library,

360
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,140
just 'cause the Internet was
not full of stuff as it is now.

361
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:44,408
It's also nice to get out of the office.

362
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,076
It's a change of scenery.

363
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,980
I used to think like, on Full Throttle,

364
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,800
I went to the library and I
got so much done on the first day.

365
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,260
I was like, this is great,
this is my new secret.

366
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,980
And then I went down the next
day and I didn't get any work done.

367
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,980
It was like, what's going on?

368
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,460
And I got a lot of
work done in the office.

369
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,560
And then sometimes I get a
lot of work done in my home.

370
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,560
And sometimes I think
there's no one answer.

371
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,680
You just have to keep moving
around and shuffling around.

372
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,640
And I think in the end it really
in some ways doesn't matter.

373
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,180
You just have to like work at it every
day and some days you get nothing done,

374
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,074
some days you get a lot done.

375
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,800
But you have to do it every day.

376
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:23,060
[Music]

377
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,464
Schafer: Yeah, it's
coming along really fast.

378
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,524
I mean, they really are
working twice as fast as Act One.

379
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,500
And we don't have everyone
that we had in Act One.

380
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,380
Remember in Act One we had
like JP and Brandon, all these people.

381
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:40,040
This one's been on the gameplay side
just like Anna and Ben cranking away on it.

382
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:47,560
[Music]

383
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,120
Rice: There's certain puzzles
we should make sure to hit first.

384
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,960
Petty: I think we should hit the
stuff that we played the least first,

385
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,840
which is the radiation suit puzzle.

386
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,280
I would do that one first.
Rice: Cool.

387
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,080
Schafer: Sprint kickoff.

388
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,500
I missed the play-through
but I heard it was good.

389
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,760
Rice: The play-through was awesome.

390
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,260
Did anybody have anything
they wanted to say about it?

391
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,860
Schafer: It was particularly
awesome because I wasn't here.

392
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,420
Like everyone's like,
it seems so relaxed.

393
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,060
Petty: That was like a plus.

394
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:10,061
Schafer: Why is it so chill here?

395
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:11,041
I don't know what's going on.

396
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,760
Petty: I mean,
I think it was pretty solid.

397
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,480
I mean, the puzzles were, they became
clear in the play-through that the puzzles

398
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,980
were a lot more complex than
the first act, which was cool.

399
00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:22,640
Game Tester: This is a good puzzle.

400
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,880
I have no idea what's going on.

401
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,974
It's going to be hard.

402
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:30,654
You need a pen there, Ben?

403
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,380
Peck: Yeah, I got one.

404
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:35,587
Petty: Because there are more
steps in them and the puzzles,

405
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,960
a lot of them aren't just say
using an object in a place,

406
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,440
but there's some trial and
error things you can manipulate

407
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,620
and see different results.

408
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,593
I think the separate puzzle chains
kind of weave in and out of each other.

409
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,700
So I think that,
that's where some of the,

410
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,880
I think some people would
describe that as difficulty,

411
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,260
which is true but I think
it's also just the appearance.

412
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,000
And, and actual
complexity that was maybe

413
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,074
missing from some of the
puzzles in the first act.

414
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,240
And part of that was by
design, both to ramp it up.

415
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,360
But also, you know, Tim, I think
in both cases from a story standpoint

416
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,327
or from a theme standpoint,

417
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:10,020
the character's kind
of start constrained

418
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,960
and therefore the
player's kind of constrained.

419
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,640
And they kind of break
out of that constraint.

420
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,180
And that means that it was just a
little more, there wasn't much opportunity

421
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,120
for the puzzles to kind of weave
back and forth through each other.

422
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:23,460
Kipnis: So what are
your thoughts, you guys?

423
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,940
Rice: It's fucking awesome. So good.

424
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,580
Kipnis: It's really long.
Peck: Yeah.

425
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,415
Rice: It's super fun.

426
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,520
Peck: I really love that last puzzle.
Rice: Yeah.

427
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,300
I think it's just like for my level
it feels like what we're hoping,

428
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,500
which is like much less
linear and spread out

429
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,140
and you're having to really
kind of retrace your steps a lot.

430
00:21:44,143 --> 00:21:46,073
Petty: So I just realized
a flaw, though, right.

431
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:49,406
Like if you are playing the girl
and you take her all the way

432
00:21:49,406 --> 00:21:54,273
to the end of her chain, and you
haven't seen the [spoiler-bleep]

433
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,280
'cause they're not part
of, we have to make sure

434
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,320
they're part of her critical
puzzle that you have to see them.

435
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,396
Because I'm thinking about this now.

436
00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:02,516
You finished him and you
didn't hear [spoiler-bleep],

437
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,820
which is what she will need
to solve the [spoiler-bleep]

438
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,020
because it's not critical path.

439
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,960
And there's no way to go back to
it, 'cause you're in a scrolling thing.

440
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,920
Rice: And yeah, same with him,

441
00:22:10,926 --> 00:22:13,740
same with her where if you've gone
all the way through and saw it

442
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,740
and just didn't notice it and then
now you don't remember the pattern.

443
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,420
Petty: Well, and this one is specifically,
you have to be able to go and test it.

444
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,853
And once we put you in this
mode, you can never go back.

445
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,240
Peck: Yeah. 
Petty: So I'm not sure how we solve that.

446
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,760
Rice: That's a good question for Tim.

447
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,600
Schafer: Oh, this is, I feel like this might
be a horrible thing I don't want to think about.

448
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,100
Petty: Yeah, we're not
really sure what to do about this.

449
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:32,535
Schafer: It's just, you have
that, it works in play-test.

450
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:35,875
Petty: No!
Rice: It doesn't work.

451
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,240
Schafer: Now we've made it so
that you, Vella and Shay need each other,

452
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,540
like you need things from both
areas to work in the other areas.

453
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,560
And we did that on purpose, but
then we forget, well, we didn't forget.

454
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,220
We just failed to remember that
you can play one character completely

455
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,218
and then like in the first act,

456
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,860
you could play all of Shay and
then go play all of Vella or vice versa.

457
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,620
And since we made them interdependent,
we thought that wasn't a problem.

458
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,180
But if you shut down
this whole character

459
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,620
and go into that looping animation
that means their act is done,

460
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,000
you can't find the things
you need to solve this one.

461
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,600
So we're just going to leave
that in the unfixable state.

462
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,460
People will be just be like,

463
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,800
how far did you get in Broken Age
before you couldn't play anymore?

464
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,780
And there'll be like a leader board.

465
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,640
More challenge.

466
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:17,747
No more hand holding.

467
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,800
I just haven't figured out
a solution to that yet.

468
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,180
It's not going to be pretty.

469
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,880
Schafer: Instead of going into
the end state where looping,

470
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,700
if you haven't solved one of those
puzzles, they go into these other states.

471
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,000
Basically stalling.

472
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,540
Rice: At that point it does feel
like it's kind of closing people off

473
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,060
and a bit handhold-y.

474
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,580
I don't know. Yeah.

475
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,360
Schafer: OK, So we acknowledge that
that is a horrible problem for Ben to solve.

476
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,160
Petty: That we're
trying to introduce some,

477
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,580
more than just story relationships
between the separate characters.

478
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:06,820
And since we've only really
taken Shay's second act to Alpha,

479
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,780
the exact solution for
how to kind of play on those

480
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,060
and that gameplay impact
isn't really obvious

481
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,480
until we develop more
of Vella's side of things.

482
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,900
Rice: I'm really happy with
Alpha on the section we just did.

483
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,960
And I don't know, the rest
of development is super tight

484
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,460
if we're still trying to get December.

485
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,360
And I think that everybody
really wants to make it happen

486
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,600
so I think that if we can keep
pushing forward it should be,

487
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,440
at least we got a shot right now.

488
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,360
I think a lot of it's going
to come down to like

489
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:36,540
this next month and a
half is really important.

490
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,680
In three, four weeks we'll
see where the writing is

491
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,480
and hopefully if things look good

492
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,800
we can rally behind it and
push to make it happen.

493
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,600
Crook: I don't know. December.

494
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,960
What are we in, October?

495
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,260
November, yeah, no.

496
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,240
That's not going to happen.

497
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,060
As far as I can tell.

498
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,760
But we do not, I have
not heard another date.

499
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,531
That's the only date I've heard,
but I just think that there's,

500
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,258
there's too much work, I think.

501
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,160
As far as I can tell, there's
way too much work,

502
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,980
but that's kind of up to the
producers to figure that out.

503
00:25:16,298 --> 00:25:38,001
[Music]

504
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,273
Schafer: The puzzles are
great, the writing is late.

505
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:47,140
But I've been getting some
more done, so everybody shut up.

506
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,050
Rice: Like we're just not moving at the
pace that that timeline has us moving at.

507
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,360
And now that we're getting
more and more writing,

508
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,180
we're having a better idea
of what it's looking like, too.

509
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:05,480
But yeah, I think that the conversation
of December is still conversation

510
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,600
that's happening and one that needs
to probably be had further, soon.

511
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,780
'Cause this is another sprint of like

512
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,960
pushing stuff off into the
next sprint as we have been.

513
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,660
Kipnis: The problem with Vella's side

514
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,320
is that there are a lot of like
mechanical or physical puzzles

515
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,720
that are like, I don't know if it's
going to communicate what we want.

516
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,540
Like I don't know if it's going
to work exactly like how we expect.

517
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,799
I just, I worry about the deadline.

518
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,568
Rice: I think it's true, I just
don't know if it's going to be able to,

519
00:26:30,568 --> 00:26:34,440
if it's going to be able to affect
the timing or the VO sessions and stuff.

520
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,240
'Cause otherwise we're pushing
it off to where Camden seemed to get

521
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,940
dropped with a bunch of stuff and...

522
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,535
Petty: That sounds like
the perfect solution to me.

523
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,320
Rice: Well, and Ray
and the animators are just,

524
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,860
yeah, going to be looking for stuff.

525
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,620
Crook: Effects artist...

526
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,480
Schafer: Push him a little 
farther until he gets grumpy..

527
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,880
Petty: Oh the effects
artist we're going to hire.

528
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,460
Schafer: Still trying to make December.

529
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,312
I mean a lot of it's hard for
people to commit to something

530
00:26:59,312 --> 00:27:01,912
being done on a certain date
if a lot of things are unknown.

531
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,280
Like we don't know what
the final act is going to look like.

532
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,820
And like I can see it, but if they
don't know exactly what all the assets

533
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,460
are going to be, it's hard for them
to say it will be done by December.

534
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,500
But I still feel good about it.

535
00:27:14,672 --> 00:27:18,812
Schafer: I, I think
I found it and brought it in

536
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,920
and left it as a gift for my producers.

537
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,320
Just to give them something I could
never actually give them in real life.

538
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,060
I mean, if we're not done in December,
we'd definitely be done in January,

539
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,560
that's the thing.

540
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,987
So it just seems like so
close, like why miss it.

541
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,460
Schafer: I finally finished
the Act Two girl dialogue,

542
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,757
so the spaceship dialogue is done,

543
00:27:34,757 --> 00:27:37,637
which is exciting for me
personally, thank you, Anna.

544
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,120
Yeah, it's between us.

545
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,218
It's really important.

546
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,880
So now I'm just writing, I just to have
to write the finale, which looks like this.

547
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,420
Had a lot of spoilers right there.

548
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,332
Don't film that part.

549
00:27:51,332 --> 00:27:52,419
Schafer: I got to finish.

550
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:54,899
I'm so close to being done
with the dialogue for the game,

551
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,100
which would be a
huge milestone in my life,

552
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,960
'cause all I can think about
is dialogue for this game.

553
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,080
There's a lot of dialogue in this game.

554
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,240
Offscreen Voice: So
why are you standing up?

555
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,760
Schafer: I'm standing up
'cause I had my gall bladder out.

556
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,900
I'm trying to act cool so
people don't know that I had it out,

557
00:28:07,908 --> 00:28:10,420
but I don't like to sit down,

558
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:14,260
'cause if I fold the part where they
cut me open and take it out, it kind of hurts.

559
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,697
But that was on Friday.

560
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,500
And now it's Monday, I'm fine.

561
00:28:17,503 --> 00:28:21,755
It's no big deal, gall
bladders are stupid, overrated.

562
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,780
Offscreen Voice: Is that
because of the juice diet?

563
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:26,700
Schafer: No one knows if it was
because of the juice diet or not.

564
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,500
Like some people, the
doctor said it's just genetic

565
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,914
and you're just prone to having
gall bladders, gall bladder stones, gallstones.

566
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,620
But my wife is sure it's the juice diet.

567
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,891
Offscreen Voice: So no more juice?

568
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:40,949
Schafer: I don't know.

569
00:28:40,949 --> 00:28:41,769
This has been a long project.

570
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:45,117
I've been through many bodily
changes through this project.

571
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,320
Stress. It's probably just
stress, games gonna kill me.

572
00:28:48,964 --> 00:28:51,136
Oh, my tush is going to hurt.

573
00:28:51,136 --> 00:28:53,581
I'm going to sit. I have to sit down.

574
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:56,508
That pen's a goner, 'cause
I can't go down there and get it.

576
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,980
Schafer: Last week we went
to PAX, that was awesome.

577
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,960
We didn't do a bunch of Broken Age
stuff 'cause Broken Age is all stealth,

578
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,352
Since we're showing 
the other games.

579
00:29:55,352 --> 00:29:56,692
Rice: A lot of people
asked about it, though.

580
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,860
Schafer: A lot of people asked about it,
a lot of people said they loved Part One.

581
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,360
Rice: Exactly.
Schafer: And that was nice.

582
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,794
Rice: I actually had a lot of
people say don't make it harder.

583
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,395
That was like the
comment and feedback I got.

584
00:30:05,395 --> 00:30:08,118
Schafer: Shit.
Kipnis: Well, it's too late now.

585
00:30:08,118 --> 00:30:09,554
Rice: Yeah, they're all talking
about how they like to play with their kids

586
00:30:09,554 --> 00:30:11,278
and how it's a too great experience.

587
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,454
So, something to keep in mind.

00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,400
