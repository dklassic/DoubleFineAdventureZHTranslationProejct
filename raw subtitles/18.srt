1
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:35,924
Ray: It'll be all right, Tim.

2
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:37,084
Hansen: It's all right.
We'll figure this out.

3
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:40,648
Tim: Are you saying I shouldn't do it?

4
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:42,242
Hansen: Don't do it. Don't do it.

5
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,603
Ray: We'll make it work.

6
00:00:43,603 --> 00:00:44,832
Tim: You're just mad
because if I did this

7
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:47,414
it would not solve the
problem for you guys.

8
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,811
Hansen: It just makes it worse actually.
Ray: Yeah.

9
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:52,135
Hansen: That's right.
It makes it easier for you.

10
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:56,555
Ray: There're still pickup lines that
haven't been written, aren't there?

11
00:00:57,506 --> 00:01:22,126
[Music]

12
00:01:22,674 --> 00:01:26,207
Tim: I really am trying everything to
make sure the game comes out this year.

13
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:28,767
Ray: December. What are
we in, October, November?

14
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:30,083
Yeah, I know that's not gonna happen.

15
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,013
Tim: I gotta finish.

16
00:01:31,013 --> 00:01:32,673
I'm so close to being
done with the dialogue

17
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,740
for the game which would be
a huge milestone in my life

18
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:37,868
because all I can think about
is the dialogue for this game.

19
00:01:37,868 --> 00:01:38,937
There's a lot of dialogue in this game.

20
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,740
Okay, we're gonna start.

21
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,800
Weeklies, here we are,
back on the project.

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,492
Hey, guess what. I finished
all the dialogue for the game.

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,260
It's awesome. Yay!

24
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,912
[Clapping]

25
00:01:49,912 --> 00:01:50,572
That's a relief.

26
00:01:50,572 --> 00:01:51,272
Crook: Finally.

27
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,795
Schafer: Well, I mean you didn't have to
put it that way, but yeah, yeah, finally.

28
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:54,875
Crook: Someone had to say it!

29
00:01:57,133 --> 00:02:00,253
I know I was going on my calendar today
and there's a big recurring appointment

30
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,736
for Reds writing and
I went and I deleted it.

31
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:04,125
Oh, my God, this is exciting.

32
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,299
I'm never gonna write again.

33
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,079
Never write again. Never write again.

34
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,918
So actually I'm playing
through the game right now

35
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:11,678
and I'm making notes of
what dialogue I need to write.

36
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,420
Other than that I'm totally done.

37
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:20,980
[Music]

38
00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:24,105
And then Tim nobly finished
the last of the dialogue

39
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:27,085
and everyone was happy forever, the end.

40
00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:30,305
And that's the end of that chapter.

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,480
Does anybody have any questions?

42
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,017
Broken Age, broken Age.

43
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:41,757
That's our rousing chant, broken age.

44
00:02:42,982 --> 00:02:43,782
Bye.

45
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:45,677
Peck: What's new, man?

46
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,417
We have gotten a butt
ton of writing from Tim.

47
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:52,099
Crook: It's really good writing.

48
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:54,388
And the performances that
we've gotten back are really good

49
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:56,950
and so that kind of
puts the pressure on you

50
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:03,310
as an animator that you want to do that
writing and those performances justice.

51
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:07,366
So that's, that's pressure,
but good pressure.

52
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:09,106
It feels like things
are moving smoothly.

53
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,115
It feels that way.

54
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:15,150
Anna: We're like
finishing in record time.

55
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,250
We're actually ahead of schedule in
a lot of ways which is like, you know,

56
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,770
pretty rare for us because
usually we're pretty slammed.

57
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:27,932
Lee: Yes, I can show you some mockups
that we're working on in Vella, yeah, yeah.

58
00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:30,217
This scene here is where Vella starts.

59
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:33,517
Players have already seen
this, you know, the split screen

60
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:37,247
at the very end of the game, and this
is kind of what that scene continues as.

61
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:41,312
And then this is the first puzzle
you see here is her skill here.

62
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:45,469
So this is a fairly elaborate
puzzle that the player has to hit,

63
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:49,115
and so a lot of this is just
breakdowns of how it all works.

64
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:52,548
So we have the Hex Pals are returning.

65
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:54,466
Of course. I love the Hex Pals

66
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:56,628
so I'm hoping to do
more with them this time.

67
00:03:56,628 --> 00:03:59,594
I think the Hex Pals and the
Spoon, that stuff was all the big hits,

68
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:02,637
like the surprise, like everyone
loved these little side characters.

69
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:05,253
We have now heard a lot
more feedback on that first act

70
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:08,252
than you ever would if you
were just gonna release it at once

71
00:04:08,252 --> 00:04:10,678
because it's been out in the
wild and people have lived with it.

72
00:04:10,678 --> 00:04:14,239
We've lived it for a while so
we have more perspective on it.

73
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,813
Maybe that means the
choices we're making for Act 2

74
00:04:17,813 --> 00:04:21,767
are just a little bit better formed
than they would've been if it was just,

75
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:23,469
you know, one big push.

76
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:25,357
And then just a lot of scenes in Act 2,

77
00:04:25,357 --> 00:04:28,203
I can  walk you around some
of those if you want to see.

78
00:04:28,203 --> 00:04:30,488
I can show you some
with the spaceship stuff.

79
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:34,005
So we've tried to go
through and make it look like

80
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:38,069
you're driving by the countryside
and damage some of the rooms.

81
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,788
Schafer: Exciting, really going places.

82
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:41,688
Petty: If you go in that doorway
on the left there's some ambience there.

83
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:46,821
Schafer: It's too bad we have puzzles in both
those places because it'd be funny to see

84
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:49,275
a room that was there
before and then just isn't there,

85
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:51,175
like so the door is open
like to the avalanche area.

86
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,020
No, we need that one.

87
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,200
Or to the like the friendship
circle where something just opens

88
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,980
and then it just like
[explosive noise] just space in there.

89
00:04:57,726 --> 00:05:00,923
It could just be you open it
and it's just the shards of a room

90
00:05:00,923 --> 00:05:03,681
and there's just a bunch
of yarn pals hanging on.

91
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:05,041
Aaahh!

92
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,101
They're just stuck out there.

93
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:08,181
Petty: I was thinking that
for any of the rooms like that,

94
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:10,261
that we should have the doors
and then continue on in animation state

95
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:11,831
where they can't quite close or open.

96
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,360
They're just kinda...

97
00:05:14,202 --> 00:05:15,922
Schafer: They're closing
over a severed human foot.

98
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,996
Peck: There's some cool game
play that's like nonstandard stuff

99
00:05:20,244 --> 00:05:23,600
where like you're
floating in zero gravity

100
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,894
and so like you play
around with the physics of that.

101
00:05:25,894 --> 00:05:30,426
So this is one of those instances
where we were in a brainstorm meeting

102
00:05:30,426 --> 00:05:33,909
and we were like what if
the whole ship just like rotated

103
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:36,505
because it's taking off, right?

104
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:39,654
And everyone was like, oh shit.

105
00:05:39,654 --> 00:05:42,286
Offscreen: Once you solve that and
you get up here and the doors open,

106
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:43,867
that's when we do the;

107
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:46,923
and then we cut to the old scene
and now you're floating above it.

108
00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:48,301
You're like, how do I get down there?

109
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:49,441
Schafer: So she
could be spinning.

110
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:51,341
So there could be a timing thing
that you have to do a certain thing

111
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:52,821
which is aim a certain direction.

112
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,651
Petty: We could have like the
boy's magnetic boots stuck on the hole,

113
00:05:56,998 --> 00:05:59,057
you know, if we wanted
to use those somehow.

114
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:00,397
Schafer: And you just
like want to drift over to it

115
00:06:00,397 --> 00:06:02,697
and grab it and use it to like.

116
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:05,017
Petty: Oh, wait,
there's a scarf on the suit.

117
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,200
So if you could take
the scarf off the floating suit.

118
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,160
Peck: Not exactly
your typical adventure game.

119
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,360
Walk to "A" to "B".

120
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:18,985
Crap, I missed it. It's a timing puzzle.

121
00:06:18,985 --> 00:06:22,601
You have to like line up the
rotations of these two things.

122
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:24,799
Damn it. I missed it again.

123
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:28,323
I anticipate a lot of
amazing play testing feedback

124
00:06:28,323 --> 00:06:32,525
from this with people
being like fuck that mini game.

125
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:36,385
We've also had to think
outside the box in terms of like,

126
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:40,477
especially because we're reusing
environments so we can't just make

127
00:06:40,477 --> 00:06:43,469
a new environment that
supports really difficult puzzles.

128
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:47,270
We have to use the
environments we've already made.

129
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,136
And so yeah, we
consciously wanted to try and,

130
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:52,126
try and do things that
we hadn't done before.

131
00:06:52,126 --> 00:06:54,854
Let's have a puzzle that
goes across multiple scenes.

132
00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:56,912
Let's like rotate the ship.

133
00:06:56,912 --> 00:06:59,120
Let's play with the fact
that we're on a spaceship.

134
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,063
We're in space.

135
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:01,403
Maybe there's no gravity.

136
00:07:01,403 --> 00:07:03,886
There's this really weird
plot device that we have in Act 1

137
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:07,340
where like the mom could magically
manipulate everything on the ship.

138
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,631
What if Vella could gain
access to that system?

139
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:12,172
Like, that's a really
cool idea to pursue.

140
00:07:12,172 --> 00:07:16,037
And like a lot of really great puzzle
ideas came out of that kind of,

141
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:17,674
that kind of thinking.

142
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:19,939
Kipnis: It's just like
ways to interact with the ship

143
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:24,239
or to see the same space
in a completely original context.

144
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,169
Schafer: And the
team is starting to wire out

145
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,853
the first few puzzles for
Vella on the spaceship now.

146
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:31,637
That's mostly what was going on.

147
00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:33,596
Reds. Unless I forgot something.

148
00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:35,476
Anyone want to do anything else?

149
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,400
Okay, now I have to go the bad
and not fun part of the meeting

150
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,899
where I have some bad
news to tell you about,

151
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,426
someone else leaving the
company which is never very fun.

152
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:49,046
Isa is leaving and oh,
man, come on up here, Isa.

153
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:53,186
Stamos: So I just want to let you
know I'll be cheering Double Fine on,

154
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,420
and I've loved my time here.

155
00:07:57,153 --> 00:08:07,173
[Applause]

156
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,878
Schafer: Luckily we have Matt
Hanson who was our right-hand man,

157
00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:15,337
and he's stepping right into the role
of being the VP of product development

158
00:08:16,477 --> 00:08:19,416
so he's doing that job which
means he probably has less time

159
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,422
to do producer type stuff on Broken Age.

160
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:24,742
Yeah, I might
technically be short a producer.

161
00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:28,007
I hadn't thought about
that. Now I'm terrified.

162
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,227
I'm never gonna
make December. We'll see.

163
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:34,221
That'll delay them in making that schedule
that says we can't make December so that

164
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:38,216
way I can hopefully get the game done
before anyone realizes it's impossible.

165
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:39,296
I think we're
gonna make December.

166
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,919
We'll never make December.

167
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,100
Shut up. Shut up.

168
00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:48,792
Ow, that really hurts.

169
00:08:55,644 --> 00:08:58,464
Peck: That's like
above my pay grade, dude.

170
00:08:58,464 --> 00:08:59,970
Russell: Like, what do I think?

171
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,492
Just for me or the whole game?

172
00:09:01,492 --> 00:09:03,521
Offscreen: The whole game I guess.

173
00:09:03,521 --> 00:09:05,881
Malena and I think
it's gonna be March.

174
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:09,580
I'm not sure who thought ever
December was really gonna be it.

175
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,478
Offscreen: Tim.
Russell: Yeah.

176
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,108
Kipnis: Yeah, I don't, I don't actually
know the release date at this point.

177
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:17,113
I think it's gonna be largely
driven by how long it takes

178
00:09:17,404 --> 00:09:20,084
for all of the animations to be final

179
00:09:20,873 --> 00:09:24,425
because the animators are gonna be
slammed pretty hard since some of the voice

180
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:28,713
is getting into the
game so late unfortunately.

181
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:30,723
Schafer: Yeah, some of the VO talent

182
00:09:30,723 --> 00:09:33,723
has been harder to get
in the studio than others,

183
00:09:34,196 --> 00:09:39,266
and so you have a couple
big characters that have yet to be

184
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:41,626
recorded and that
holds up all the cut scenes.

185
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:45,118
We're looking at cut
scene layouts together

186
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:49,298
so that Ray can know
whether they're ready to go.

187
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,699
What's a layout, Ray?

188
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:55,797
Crook: A layout is a first pass
of the scene with the characters

189
00:09:55,797 --> 00:10:00,240
all in their sort of place and
with the dialogue timed out.

190
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,917
Schafer: The rough cameras,
the timing, but none of the animation.

191
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,509
Crook: Yeah, none of the animation.

192
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:08,165
Schafer: Whipped Cream Hill fail.

193
00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:12,085
Crook: She gets it too.

194
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:12,865
Schafer: Who did that one?

195
00:10:12,865 --> 00:10:13,476
Crook: Miyuki.

196
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:14,496
Schafer: Is it the same?

197
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,020
Crook: It's the exact same rig, yeah.

198
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,460
I think it's funny that
it's exactly the same.

199
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:24,555
Schafer: If we can just repeat the
same, she can have a whole different;

200
00:10:24,555 --> 00:10:26,761
I can't even think of a word.

201
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:29,401
Crook: I think the joke's funny because it is the same.
Schafer: Mm-hmm.

202
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,028
Crook: If you want something different.

203
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:33,528
Schafer: No, it's good.

204
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:41,460
And then we're just finishing
up on the Alpha and the G-2 act

205
00:10:41,465 --> 00:10:43,625
and then we've got to do the finale.

206
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,321
Petty: It's a whole area, new characters.

207
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:47,507
It's probably a lot of cut scene work.

208
00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:48,984
It's probably a ton of animation.

209
00:10:48,984 --> 00:10:51,666
When it's not really a 3-D world and
you have to stage things specifically

210
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,193
and you don't want to
paint a million scenes,

211
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:54,567
a lot of it really comes down to exactly

212
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,788
what is going on in the
writing and the puzzles.

213
00:10:56,788 --> 00:10:58,847
Schafer: Even though we haven't been
storyboarding a lot in the process,

214
00:10:58,847 --> 00:11:00,221
like this would be
an important one to do

215
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:03,129
because I know Peter's already
talking about musical score

216
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:08,826
and that London, I mean that Melbourne
Symphony Orchestra gig is gonna come up.

217
00:11:08,826 --> 00:11:11,998
And I think this would be a great
place to have special music

218
00:11:11,998 --> 00:11:13,772
and not use existing cues and stuff.

219
00:11:13,772 --> 00:11:16,040
So hopefully we can
actually storyboard it,

220
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,978
timing it out in the animatic
and commit to that, lock that,

221
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,818
and then have them build a score
to that while we're making it.

222
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,804
Do you want to go shot by shot then?

223
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,541
Okay, so that's the opening
shot, just like here's the situation.

224
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,300
It's happened.

225
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,489
And then we cut into an interior
shot and I was thinking interior

226
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:35,173
because I was hoping we'd just fake it
and it shows a bunch of red smoke because

227
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:39,014
like they're in the room that's the
hottest so it's like smoke is coming up.

228
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:43,088
Crook: So yeah, so this is the
animatic with Lee's storyboards.

229
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:47,281
It's very actiony, very dramatic.

230
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:54,114
It'll require some really good performance
from whoever ends up animating it.

231
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:58,962
To really just sit down and have a
big, juicy acting scene, for me that's,

232
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:02,125
I get the most enjoyment out of that

233
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:06,671
because that's when your
personality can come out in a way.

234
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:08,872
Yeah, it's gonna be a lot of work.

235
00:12:08,872 --> 00:12:10,173
It should be.

236
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:16,434
Finales should always be a lot
of work because it's 3-1/2 minutes.

237
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:18,848
So that might not sound like a lot,

238
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:22,619
but that's actually,
that's a really long scene.

239
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:25,423
It's a really long scene.

240
00:12:25,423 --> 00:12:31,930
Because if we're really locking
the timing down, which is kind of scary.

241
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,883
Petty: Yeah, I'm not sure why we'd
have to have the music scored

242
00:12:34,883 --> 00:12:38,583
before we get the dialogue
unless the deadlines are such that.

243
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,639
Crook: I think the music scores,

244
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:44,489
because they're gonna be scoring
Grim at the same time, right?

245
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:45,985
Isn't that was this whole idea is?

246
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:46,902
Petty: Oh, is it?

247
00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:48,088
Crook: I think that's what the deal is

248
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:51,228
because they only want
to book the orchestra once.

249
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,145
Crook: Isn't the idea they're
gonna book the orchestra once

250
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,094
and they're gonna do Grim
and this at the same time?

251
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,088
Crook: We were talking about whether
we could take it to the next level or not

252
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:10,685
which would be maya animatic.

253
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,201
Petty: We certainly can, but
there's a ridiculous amount of work

254
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:15,932
right now for all this other stuff.

255
00:13:15,932 --> 00:13:18,516
And so it's just a matter of
where we're putting; I can't.

256
00:13:18,516 --> 00:13:19,382
I have the storyboard.

257
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,181
I can't really describe
all this to Bagel

258
00:13:21,181 --> 00:13:24,912
and then have him storyboard it
remotely so I have to storyboard it.

259
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:25,918
No, I mean, it can be done.

260
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:29,994
It's just; I think it just gets down to
the conversation we always sort of have

261
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:34,677
and don't have an
answer for which is date.

262
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,712
Petty: Well, it's the only
thing that a hard deadline.

263
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,660
Yeah, and then I've been working
with Vic on the all timeline stuff too.

264
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,324
Yeah, I think we're trying to put
together like a whole new pass on it

265
00:14:07,494 --> 00:14:10,653
and we've talked with most of the
leads and everything already about stuff.

266
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:15,312
So probably within the next week
or so we'll have a, ooh, bless you.

267
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,888
Probably in the next week or so we'll
have a new full timeline to share.

268
00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:22,994
I think it's pretty safe to say at this
point already that it's not December;

269
00:14:22,994 --> 00:14:25,829
like we've already talked about
that with pretty much everybody.

270
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:26,907
Schafer: Not me.

271
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,487
Rice: Yeah, we've talked
about it multiple times.

272
00:14:29,487 --> 00:14:32,267
Tim: Yeah, totally ambushed
me with that December thing.

273
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,410
Well, they've all been talking
about how they don't feel like we're gonna

274
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:40,340
make December and we probably
aren't, but I haven't seen any date.

275
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:42,204
You know, it's like it's all hunches.

276
00:14:42,204 --> 00:14:44,261
It's all people's
hunches versus hunches,

277
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:47,153
but they're supposed to
be doing a waterfall schedule

278
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:50,939
which is like all the
dependencies linked out

279
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:53,266
and that will show us
ending a certain month.

280
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:55,266
And hopefully it's not April.

281
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:01,465
But it's almost like if you believe
it's going to be March then it will be March.

282
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:05,591
And if you're trying to hit
December it'll be hopefully January.

283
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,891
But if everyone's just like
we're not even trying to make December

284
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,150
then we'll slip even worse.

285
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:17,484
So it's hard to kind of keep a sense of
urgency on the project when you feel like;

286
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,554
because we're spending
our own money on it now

287
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:23,979
so it's not like a publisher milestone,
like the milestone's due in December

288
00:15:23,979 --> 00:15:26,209
and everyone just
always takes that seriously.

289
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:28,015
And when we have something
that's an internal milestone

290
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:32,263
or a milestone that only
Double Fine is holding you accountable for,

291
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:34,318
people are like, well, we've
got an extra week and stuff.

292
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:39,284
And that's a hard, a hard thing
to instill that sense of like

293
00:15:39,284 --> 00:15:43,741
taking a milestone seriously even
when it's just us because it's more money.

294
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:46,553
Every week that it goes
it costs more money.

295
00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:51,042
And it's longer the backers will
have to wait and it's, you know,

296
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:54,023
the longer that we have to put
off other things we want to do.

297
00:15:54,023 --> 00:15:59,071
So I still push for getting
it done as soon as possible.

298
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:01,798
Rice: Yeah, there's a lot of work left.

299
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:04,730
It's probably not gonna be December,
but we're figuring out when it would be.

300
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,268
It looks like the thing we're
thinking, we're hoping for December,

301
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:11,171
is we've got two more
weeks on Act 2 stuff,

302
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:14,601
and then the finale stuff
we're thinking is like six

303
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:16,940
for like a really solid safe Alpha.

304
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,201
And with all the like holiday stuff in
before the end of the year and everything,

305
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:22,443
that kind of takes us almost
exactly to the end of the year.

306
00:16:22,443 --> 00:16:24,236
Then you have the
matter of closing it out

307
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:28,125
is what we're trying to
figure out now, so okay.

308
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,423
Annable: I could've told
you like a day back in July

309
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:33,063
it wasn't gonna happen for December.

310
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,736
Schafer: I'm gonna wait till
I see all the numbers.

311
00:16:37,736 --> 00:16:41,780
Now it's at, well, we're really
close to when it should be wrapping up

312
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,289
if it's gonna be done in December.

313
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:47,009
We should have the voice in,
and we don't have the final three characters in.

314
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:49,061
We're doing that next week.

315
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:53,543
On Reds I am going down to help
with the VO recording which is happening

316
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:57,997
Wednesday, Thursday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday of this week.

317
00:16:57,997 --> 00:17:00,132
That's for Vella.

318
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:02,770
Brown: I don't feel confident
about that at this point.

319
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,954
I'll be honest.

320
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:07,206
I'm more comfortable
saying what I really think

321
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:08,547
because I don't want
to say it on camera.

322
00:17:08,547 --> 00:17:10,147
I'll just be totally blunt.

323
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,739
And I'll try to get us
out of the studio time

324
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,079
that we've purchased
for the next four days.

325
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,332
I'm working on it.

326
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:28,052
Crook: So Tim flew down to
record dialogue, Vella in particular,

327
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,726
and she had a family emergency.

328
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:36,155
And so that kind of
messes everything up.

329
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:38,478
I mean, it's not her fault.

330
00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:40,098
People have family emergencies.

331
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:45,473
But it definitely kind of went
into panic mode a little bit.

332
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,960
Schafer: Do you see I made

333
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,000
a tiny gun to shoot myself?

334
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,105
It looks effective on camera.

335
00:17:53,256 --> 00:17:55,363
Crook: There you go. That's better.

336
00:17:55,363 --> 00:17:57,363
Open your mouth.

337
00:17:59,993 --> 00:18:00,813
It'll be all right, Tim.

338
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,900
Hansen: It's all right.
We'll figure this out.

339
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,820
Russell: Vella, for her part of
Act 2 is in almost every cut scene

340
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:13,822
so there's very few cut scenes
that she's actually not in.

341
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,596
And if Malena has us
up to date as of today,

342
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:19,279
everything that's red
hasn't been recorded yet.

343
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,545
And you can guess who this might be.

344
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,725
This is Vella.

345
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:25,416
This is why we were
kind of freaking out.

346
00:18:25,497 --> 00:18:27,323
That's part of the reason
why I made that document,

347
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:29,979
just to figure out,
okay, what can we do?

348
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:34,144
What can we sort of do and may
have to reanimate a little bit later?

349
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:36,539
And what's just, we just
have to have the voice?

350
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,474
Otherwise it's just gonna be tough.

351
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:42,196
Crook: So anyway we're gonna
animate to some scratch.

352
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:45,281
We're gonna not animate
some scenes with Vella.

353
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:46,888
It's gonna be a mixture of things.

354
00:18:46,888 --> 00:18:51,708
We're gonna be juggling a little bit
and then hopefully the first week of December

355
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:55,007
that's what we've been promised.

356
00:18:55,007 --> 00:19:01,527
The first week of December we'll
get the recordings done for Vella.

357
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,934
Tim: Which is really frustrating

358
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,380
because we're so late with that
dialogue and keep being even later.

359
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,380
It was nothing something
we wanted to do.

360
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,386
Annable: Waiting for her, at a
certain point it really, really hurts us

361
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:20,196
and I feel like we're already beyond,

362
00:19:20,196 --> 00:19:24,426
like way beyond where we
need to be for her recording.

363
00:19:24,426 --> 00:19:29,651
Crook: We'd have to kind of maybe
push everybody off of the project onto some other

364
00:19:29,651 --> 00:19:34,010
projects because you don't want
to be sitting around burning through money, right?

365
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,388
We have to be working
on something all the time.

366
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:40,083
I mean, it all rides on
that December, right?

367
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:44,039
It rides on the recording
actually happening in December.

368
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,123
Annable: And so if she's not available

369
00:19:46,123 --> 00:19:50,749
I think we need to have a second actor
cast who is also on hold for the same days

370
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:54,457
that we're putting Masasa
on hold when she returns.

371
00:19:54,457 --> 00:19:56,984
And if Masasa is unavailable

372
00:19:56,984 --> 00:20:00,440
then we have to go into the
studio with that backup person.

373
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,552
Schafer: A lot of people on the team
are saying we should recast,

374
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:08,483
should recast Vella with an actress
that we know we can get and be ready.

375
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:12,629
I'd be fine with it but now it just bugs
me to think of Vella having two voices

376
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,690
because there's no such
thing as a real sound-alike.

377
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,238
You can sound kind of like it, but I think
Masasa has a real unique voice

378
00:20:20,238 --> 00:20:23,218
and I think players would just know.

379
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:25,531
They would play the first act
and then the second act

380
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:27,858
would have a different actress,
and it would be that way forever.

381
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:29,529
It would always be that way.

382
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,321
Annable: It sucks, but I
don't want an actor to be

383
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:37,728
responsible for causing so
much chaos to our schedule.

384
00:20:37,728 --> 00:20:41,523
Schafer: So changing
Vella feels horrible to me

385
00:20:41,523 --> 00:20:44,452
so I'm fighting for keeping
the original actress,

386
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,459
and I'm hoping she will
come through for me.

387
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:47,673
I'm going into L.A. again

388
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:53,272
to see if the magical gopher will come
out of its hole and record some dialogue.

389
00:20:53,272 --> 00:20:55,113
We don't know what's gonna happen.

390
00:20:55,113 --> 00:20:56,893
But I just go down and
we see if she shows up.

391
00:21:01,814 --> 00:21:04,484
Rice: And Tim is reporting right now?

392
00:21:04,484 --> 00:21:06,812
Has anyone heard?
Has he sent an email yet?

393
00:21:06,812 --> 00:21:08,043
Crook: We know she showed up.

394
00:21:08,043 --> 00:21:11,583
Rice: She did? Okay.
She's there. Awesome.

395
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,120
Crook: So that's a good step.

396
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,700
Schafer: Back to the booths.

397
00:21:18,415 --> 00:21:20,375
Moyo: A really big explosion.

398
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,980
I like it when she
schemes.

399
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,160
Moyo: Hey, President Ugly.

400
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,220
Is that a dig or is
that actually his name?

401
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,440
Schafer: It's totally a dig.

402
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,240
You're pretty casual,
like, hey, what's up?

403
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,314
Moyo: Everybody thanks you.

404
00:21:44,449 --> 00:22:04,163
[Music]

405
00:22:04,163 --> 00:22:06,307
Hansen: So this meeting
is to talk about the schedule

406
00:22:06,307 --> 00:22:09,247
for finishing the rest of Act 2.

407
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,020
So I've met with Vic and Malena and
Greg to talk through the remaining work

408
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,276
and to put it all on a timeline to
see when the thing's finishing.

409
00:22:20,143 --> 00:22:21,179
This should be fairly accurate

410
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,664
because you're updated
this just recently, right?

411
00:22:23,664 --> 00:22:25,556
Romero: This is every
discussion we've had,

412
00:22:25,556 --> 00:22:29,832
every wonderful change to
our plans that's come up.

413
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:31,132
It's all on there.

414
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,620
Schafer: We thought it was going
to be April so this is actually good news.

415
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,932
Hansen: It's April to release the
game because it takes 3 weeks to manufacture.

416
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,403
But this is when development
will be done which is...

417
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:42,243
Petty: Manufacture?

418
00:22:43,341 --> 00:22:45,321
Hansen: Yep, so we're gonna do physical disks.

419
00:22:45,321 --> 00:22:47,909
Petty: Oh, that's right so it has to
be simultaneous now, right?

420
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,330
Hansen: That's part of the deal.

421
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,472
Bailey: So we did a deal with Nordic
which is yet to be released, but that's cool.

422
00:22:53,836 --> 00:22:58,455
So our deal with Nordic is that they're
gonna handle retail distribution of the

423
00:22:58,455 --> 00:23:01,405
game in Europe but also here.

424
00:23:01,405 --> 00:23:05,110
So they have some relationships
with retailers like Best Buy

425
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,653
and other really huge big box stores,

426
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:11,483
and it'd be really exciting to see
Broken Age show up there.

427
00:23:11,483 --> 00:23:13,098
The way it's actually working out

428
00:23:13,098 --> 00:23:17,057
is once we're done with the PC
version we can ship it over to them

429
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:21,548
and they have a very quick, just a
few week turnaround which is exciting.

430
00:23:21,548 --> 00:23:24,476
And during that time we're working
on the other platforms to get them ready.

431
00:23:24,476 --> 00:23:28,477
So like, you know, when you bought it,
whoever's bought it on whatever platform,

432
00:23:28,477 --> 00:23:30,897
the hope is everybody can
experience the conclusion together.

433
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,420
So that's the goal. We'll
see how close we get.

434
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:39,163
Hansen: So as you can
see this takes us basically

435
00:23:39,163 --> 00:23:41,403
to the end of the year
to get the game to Alpha.

436
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:46,944
And then we would transition on to beta
work when we return from the holidays.

437
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:52,531
And then we have six weeks of bug
fixing and polish work at the end.

438
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:56,251
This is traditionally how long we've
needed for all of our projects.

439
00:23:57,027 --> 00:23:59,179
There might be some room to pull that in

440
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:01,764
but I do think that the game
needs that much time

441
00:24:01,764 --> 00:24:06,090
in order to address all of the play test
feedback, bug fixing and polish work.

442
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,522
Schafer: Have you gone over any
of this with Justin yet?

443
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:10,422
Hansen: Only the end date.

444
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,960
Schafer: What kind of face did he make
when you talked to him about the end date?

445
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,380
Did he smile?
Hansen: No.

446
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,400
Petty: So somewhere between
constipation and Defcon 4. Hansen: Yeah.

447
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,500
Schafer: He also only smiles
when things are really bad.

448
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:29,819
Hansen: It was not a
happy face. I'll say that.

449
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,977
Schafer: That's the thing.

450
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,383
The information, I'm just
wondering is what;

451
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,185
financially can we go to
this date or can't we?

452
00:24:37,305 --> 00:24:39,402
Because before we were
talking about December

453
00:24:39,402 --> 00:24:44,313
and he was kind of like we can't go
beyond that because of financial reasons.

454
00:24:44,313 --> 00:24:46,598
And so that's what I would
like to hear from him

455
00:24:46,598 --> 00:24:49,938
is what happens if we go to this date.

456
00:24:56,448 --> 00:24:57,928
Hansen: Anything else? Tim,
do you have anything else?

457
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,720
Schafer: Some inspiring
words of wisdom. No.

458
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,820
Hey, guys, how's it going?

459
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:23,832
I'm getting a strong sense
people are trying to

460
00:25:23,832 --> 00:25:26,792
give me the message that it's
a risk to hit December.

461
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
It's gonna be tight to make December.

462
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:36,011
That's just me reading
between the lines of that meeting.

463
00:25:39,691 --> 00:25:42,131
Anyway it's gonna be over
soon one way or the other.

464
00:25:43,132 --> 00:26:39,679
[Music]

465
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,519
Peck: You getting this?

466
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,380
This is good shit.
