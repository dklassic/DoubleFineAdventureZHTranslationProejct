00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:40,500
[Piano plays Mozart's Piano Sonata No 11]

2
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,006
McConnell: This is the first music 
I remember in my life, hearing.

3
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:59,624
[Music]

4
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,780
McConnell: So it's the Swiss side of me there.

5
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,536
It's just really great to 
be able to sit down

6
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:10,557
and play something without turning it on.

7
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,607
Makes music.

8
00:01:14,338 --> 00:01:38,958
[Music]

9
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,380
Hansen: I get really nervous 
around cameras, it's my thing.

10
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,300
All right.

11
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,360
Hansen: Yeah, Shellmount first pass.

12
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,960
Dead Eye God first pass.

13
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,460
Lumberjack first pass.

14
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,340
Localization QA starts.

15
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,140
Rice: Live instrument recording.

16
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,580
Liu: Yeah, VO play-testing and testing.

17
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,700
Rice: This is the big one.

18
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,400
Liu: Oh, you're putting it in all caps?

19
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,160
Rice: Of course. There it is.

20
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,819
Schafer: Do you want to talk about schedule 
stuff before we begin the meeting?

21
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,599
Rice: Sure. Very exciting stuff.

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,340
Schafer: Greg's got exciting 
schedule stuff to talk about.

23
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,660
Rice: OK. Well, today's 
end of a sprint, right?

24
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,900
So we should talk about 
this in light of that.

25
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,666
But yeah, Matt and Sue and I 
have been working on schedule stuff

26
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:56,206
for the project for a while now.

27
00:02:56,206 --> 00:02:59,126
So we have a lot of data 
that I guess we'd talked through.

28
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,640
But I guess first we should 
probably just walk through

29
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,940
how all this stuff happened, 
to explain where we came from.

30
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,020
Bailey: And the thought is, is that 
we potentially have scope-wise,

31
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:16,213
enough content for a game 
to ship sooner rather than later.

32
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,300
Schafer: January for Part One 
and April for Part Two.

33
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,857
Schafer: As long as it's 
definitely just Part One

34
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,480
and you're definitely 
going to get Part Two.

35
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,507
It's not just, because I hated the end of Empire.

36
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,720
I mean, when I was a kid and they 
ended that way, I was like what the fuck?

37
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,860
Rice: So that's how we got to this.

38
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,177
So this is kind of where that 
is for Part One right now

39
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,780
and then there's also Part Two down here.

40
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:47,360
But it kind of gives you a good 
snapshot as far as what the next year

41
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,380
would look like to hit that January date.

42
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,280
Schafer: And even this is pretty scary 
when you look at just two weeks,

43
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,220
total for Dead Eye God Pyramid.

44
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,174
Like us all together working on that 
and banging that whole room out.

45
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,880
The interior and the exterior in two weeks, right? 
Rice: Yep.

46
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,700
Schafer: Has that been proven 
to work by January? Or April?

47
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,766
Rice: Yeah, I mean as far as, 
like as accurate as we can get.

48
00:04:08,766 --> 00:04:11,303
Like we're, 
Schafer: You did already or...

49
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:12,988
Hansen: We quantified that. 
Schafer: OK.

50
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:15,508
Rice: Yeah. We went through and 
like assigned what each of those scenes,

51
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:18,787
how complex they are compared to 
an average scene, which we called the Galley.

52
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,344
And ran the numbers on all of it 
and that's how we figured out

53
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:24,558
like how many scenes 
and what type we can get.

54
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:26,314
So there's a little bit of fudging there,

55
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,265
like if you have scenes that 
are super-complex,

56
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:31,085
that's going to count as more 
than something that's a hallway.

57
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,190
Schafer: It also shows 
the consequences of if

58
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,614
we don't get that Dead Eye 
done in two weeks.

59
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,420
You see there's no other room 
for it to go into expect for the push.

60
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,780
Rice: Yeah.

61
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,160
Schafer: Push all the other dates out,

62
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,620
which would be a huge problem 
because the deadline in January

63
00:04:44,623 --> 00:04:45,883
is a revenue-based deadline,

64
00:04:45,883 --> 00:04:50,923
basically that Justin says he 
needs that revenue in January orâ€¦

65
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,980
Bailey: The reason the game 
must be done in January

66
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,600
is because that's at the time 
we've run out of funds for that game.

67
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,855
We're taking all the funds the 
studio makes and putting it into Broken Age.

68
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,108
Like all of them.

69
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,042
So, but it becomes, in January, 
this comes this point in time

70
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:13,637
where floating that big of 
a team on an ongoing basis

71
00:05:13,816 --> 00:05:18,316
just can't be done out of our own 
royalties and our own profits of the studio.

72
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,020
Like it breaks at that time.

73
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,978
So yeah, we just, we have to ship something

74
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,140
and have to start making 
some money off that project.

75
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,415
Peck: It's a little surprising 
that we have four weeks

76
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,998
for spaceship Beta, 
given how far we've taken it.

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,924
Rice: Yeah, and I think so, too.

78
00:05:33,924 --> 00:05:35,204
It's weird when you look at that stuff,

79
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:38,248
but the reasons are like 
if you look at this list,

80
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:42,418
the amount of scenes in the spaceship 
are pretty much equal to

81
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,056
the amount of scenes in 
the entire girl's world.

82
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,443
And you know there is, 
Lee: Animation.

83
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:49,823
I mean you got to do all the final animation.

84
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:51,383
Rice: All the animation, 
Lee: a lot of cut scenes.

85
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:52,966
Schafer: And the thing about that 
is, is that this,

86
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:55,954
because this is so tight and 
uncomfortable and there's not a big space for like,

87
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,640
there's some play-test feedback in here

88
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,402
but it's not like a month of 
just play-test feedback or two,

89
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,662
which is what we'd really like.

90
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,440
So I think we're always going 
to have to be looking at places

91
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,000
where we're finishing some things early

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,243
and if that four weeks 
sounds like a lot of time,

93
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,183
that maybe hopefully it means 
that the game play programmers

94
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:12,023
could get ahead to create that buffer

95
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:14,363
where we actually do have like 
a month to play-test feedback.

96
00:06:14,363 --> 00:06:15,383
That would be awesome.

97
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,680
Schafer: The schedule's done

98
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,480
and I want it to be a 
little more like a home run

99
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,026
than it is, because it's kind of like yeah,

100
00:06:21,026 --> 00:06:22,526
it looks on paper like we can do it,

101
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:24,214
but there's not a lot of wiggle room.

102
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,374
And normally you want 
a lot of buffer time

103
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,740
because things always do go wrong 
and take longer than you thought.

104
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,079
So I think we just have 
a little more work to do on it

105
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,210
to make sure we have 
enough buffer room in it.

106
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,396
Or we have to go along every 
time we get something done,

107
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,616
try and get it done a little early.

108
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,816
But that's always kind of like dreaming.

109
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,980
Like every project, you want to do that.

110
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,700
Like, oh, let's just get 
everything done a little bit early

111
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,980
and then we'll build up a buffer time.

112
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,934
But I haven't, haven't ever 
seen that really happen.

113
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,060
Rice: Do we have other thoughts?

114
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,220
Questions?

115
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,500
This thing's all alive so it's 
really easy to plug numbers in it

116
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,520
and change them around
 and see where it goes,

117
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:05,100
Schafer: I think the, doing early access 
for the game impacts Oliver the most.

118
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,171
Because his stuff has to be done.

119
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,240
His system work has 
to be done in January.

120
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,300
He's got to have a 
shippable product in January,

121
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,553
which means all the, there's 
a lot of like stuff that, you know,

122
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,511
you tend to have pushed 
off to the end of the project,

123
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,020
just the kind of like, 
maybe it's optimization

124
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,160
or just wrapping things up 
to make sure that they're airtight.

125
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,280
You know, that all has 
to happen a lot earlier.

126
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:28,323
And that's probably hardest on him.

127
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,120
Rice: Yeah. I mean, I guess 
the only thing is just,

128
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,220
just know going into starting on Monday,

129
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:36,172
we're spending three months on Sugar Bunting

130
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,380
and then, three weeks...

131
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,780
Schafer: Three months! Three months!

132
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,752
Rice: God, I wish.

133
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,860
No, three weeks on Sugar Bunting 
and then moving on, so.

134
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,340
I mean, you can see why.

135
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,524
Schafer: OK. I wrote a thing explaining 
the early access stuff to the backers

136
00:07:50,524 --> 00:07:52,424
and we'll do an update on Monday.

137
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,980
That is, a full-on update with 
the episode on Monday?No.

138
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,014
Rice: No. Episode will be Tuesday;

139
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,291
I think you're just going 
to post in the forums, like.

140
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,760
Schafer: So when is Chris writing 
an update, on Tuesday.

141
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:05,951
Schafer: And that's the one 
that's attached to the episode.

142
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,320
Schafer: In Red's this week 
we're having episode ten go out live,

143
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,756
which is the one where 
we're talking our shipping plan.

144
00:08:14,947 --> 00:08:20,047
And so that could be very active, 
a very active week for the backers.

145
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,000
Active in just how much they love the new 
plan, talking about that is what I mean.

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,520
And then, 
Team Member: Is it going out today?

147
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,380
Schafer: Tomorrow.

148
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,100
Schafer: OK, here's my post. Long post.

149
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,119
I like the first thing; sounds great.

150
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,620
And so the wait for January begins.

151
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,187
What a pleasant fellow.

152
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,000
And what would we need 
the next one, mean and horrible.

153
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,760
Sounds OK with me, chief.

154
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,840
See, like they're talking to me.

155
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,226
People are pretty polite.

156
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,700
Yeah, see all these people 
are really positive about it.

157
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,169
I don't want to scroll down any farther 
in case someone says something mean.

158
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,000
But let's see how long is this thread.

159
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,140
This is like three pages now, four, five.

160
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,076
Schafer: We announced the new plan 
for releasing the game on our forums

161
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,521
and our backers are pretty great about it.

162
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:02,734
I mean, they want to talk about it.

163
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,106
They were, you know;

164
00:09:04,106 --> 00:09:06,491
want to make sure it 
was going to be a good thing.

165
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,433
And I think we had a pretty good 
reaction to it, which is good,

166
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,483
because I would like to have 
this be locked and settled

167
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:16,148
and just move on to working 
on the game and not worry about this.

168
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:21,019
But some press people took that 
out of our backer forums and put it up.

169
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,580
Some of them put the entire post up, 
which is actually better than what others did,

170
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,220
which is take a couple words here and there

171
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,520
and then put the headline as like
 "Kickstarter Out of Money".

172
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,300
You know, like implying the whole 
things crashing and burning.

173
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,607
Bailey: Just eight news sources right now.

174
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:38,087
Looks like it's got the Escapist.

175
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,000
Double Fine wasn't being 
greedy with second Kickstarter.

176
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,480
I mean, there's a couple people 
that are just reacting like,

177
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,060
oh crap, there goes, 
there goes Kickstarter.

178
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,680
It's all a sham to begin with.

179
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,665
And other people are like, c'mon, right.

180
00:09:55,276 --> 00:09:57,166
Schafer: They're just, there's 
this whole crowd of people

181
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,766
who are dying for 
anti-Kickstarter news.

182
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,586
And I don't know why that is, 
but some people are just like,

183
00:10:01,586 --> 00:10:02,986
Argh, I hate this Kickstarter thing.

184
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:05,186
I can't wait for someone to
 just totally fuck it up.

185
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:07,646
That's frustrating, but 
what are you going to do?

186
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,514
Just to make the game 
awesome, get it out there

187
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,940
and then track them all 
down individually and kill them.

188
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,780
Bailey: There's some cynicism out there.

189
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,406
I mean, there's skepticism and 
that's somewhat to be expected, right?

190
00:10:19,406 --> 00:10:22,417
Because there hasn't been a big 
Kickstarter yet that's actually delivered.

191
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,080
So I mean, I can't blame too 
many people for being skeptical.

192
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,841
I think this all, you know, 
in the fullness of time will play itself out,

193
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:34,981
so when people see the end product 
it'll, you know, people will forget about this.

194
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,040
But right now there's, yeah, 
there's a bit of a shit storm.

195
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,580
Rice: Yeah, do I look tired?

196
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,340
Rice: Longer than I should have been. Yeah.

197
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,687
Remember how after the trailer we 
talked about how I looked at all those forums

198
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:57,627
and everything was super-positive?

199
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,300
It was definitely not the case last night.

200
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,352
So yeah, I spent a lot of time 
reading all of those comments

201
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,240
and trying to see what were 
actual points we should think about

202
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,860
and what is just kind of misinformed.

203
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,060
But yeah, I don't know.

204
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,147
I mean, I think it's, our backers have 
been great about coming to our support

205
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:22,675
and clarifying when people are 
giving kind of the wrong information

206
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,160
and things like that. Yeah.

207
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,400
Schafer: We were basically all 
caught off guard with it leaking

208
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,760
and then going negative so fast.

209
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,000
'Cause it's like, 'cause the more I 
look at it, the more you're like OK,

210
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:36,683
we're taking, we're making a 
bigger game than we Kickstarted.

211
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,060
We are, we're delivering it later 
but we're paying with our own money for it

212
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,600
and then doing this early 
access to fund the rest of it.

213
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,600
And then to have that framed 
as a total scam and a rip-off by us,

214
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,353
just is kind of mind boggling.

215
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,360
Bailey: So basically the press leaked our stuff,

216
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,240
which is a violation of our terms of use.

217
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,158
Remo: Because this is the 
thing when you're a journalist,

218
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,410
like I've been a journalist

219
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,427
and I feel like it gives me 
a decent perspective on this stuff.

220
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:08,327
Because as soon as one 
person goes live with it,

221
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,480
every single other person who 
publishes it is not violating shit.

222
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,540
In fact, they're almost derelict 
in their duties for just ignoring it.

223
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,342
Because as far as they're, 
from their perspective,

224
00:12:16,515 --> 00:12:18,475
it's public information 
that's already out there.

225
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,061
So you're being actually just kind 
of a weird like lackey to some developer

226
00:12:24,061 --> 00:12:27,462
if you're just saying, well, 
they wanted me to not do it.

227
00:12:27,462 --> 00:12:28,522
Rice: That was the case.

228
00:12:28,522 --> 00:12:30,834
Like once one person broke it, 
then now it's public.

229
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,640
Schafer: Then looking back on it, 
we could have done a lot of things different,

230
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,252
but I don't want to learn the lesson.

231
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,731
The most obvious lesson 
that you could learn from that,

232
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,160
is that you should be less transparent.

233
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,720
Like OK, we were just so open 
and transparent and all that,

234
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,020
that we could have probably like,

235
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,534
we could have probably 
massaged that message better

236
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,200
and hid a lot of stuff, but I 
don't know if that's really the lesson

237
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,980
I want to learn from that, 
you know what I mean?

238
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,360
Like if we had hid the whole thing 
and just been like, you know,

239
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,469
every three months push the 
launch date out three months

240
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:59,393
like most companies do 
with games, so they just slip it out.

241
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,680
And then, then hey!

242
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,040
By the way, I know it's not 
coming out 'til May,

243
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,015
but here's an early 
access thing in January.

244
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,600
That's a great thing, everyone 
would have been wow, that's great.

245
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,160
So being more secretive 
could have protected us from that,

246
00:13:11,568 --> 00:13:12,748
from that bad public response.

247
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:14,784
But that goes against everything 
that we're trying to do with the project,

248
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:17,818
was to be completely open 
and show everybody everything.

249
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,491
Remo: Part of it's also this was just 
like a learning experience for us in a way.

250
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:24,411
I think that even if we do have 
another thing that is this significant

251
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,311
that we're putting out there,

252
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,878
I think we would just, knowing 
this was going to happen,

253
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,940
probably could have 
done it a little smarter.

254
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,625
At the time, I don't know how we 
would have necessarily had that foresight.

255
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,980
Like to the degree it 
would have been necessary,

256
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,540
but I think we just need to be more careful.

257
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,050
Schafer: And now it's out 
there and whatever, you know,

258
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,770
the press makes of it or whatever 
weird comments we get from people

259
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,648
who weren't backers, that's over.

260
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,120
Well, it might go on tonight and tomorrow,

261
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:58,100
but we production-wise have moved past that 
and are just now focusing on the game.

262
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:05,960
Schafer: Hello.

263
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:09,317
Schafer: Oh man, look at that.

264
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:11,782
It's like the whole town.

265
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:13,431
The whole town looks like it's got sugar,

266
00:14:13,431 --> 00:14:15,466
like little sugar canisters; that's awesome.

267
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:18,687
Gardner: Right now we're kind of like in the middle of switching from,

268
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:22,977
I mean I'm sure you've heard from the spaceship to the Vella's

269
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:25,928
like neighborhood and baker town and all that stuff.

270
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:28,277
Roberts: Yeah, this is the first shot that they'll see.

271
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:31,090
And so what we're doing is layouts right now,

272
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:36,756
where we're just basically getting the staging with the art backgrounds

273
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:40,170
and the characters in and we're doing what we call rough blocking.

274
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,843
So in the play-throughs we can all watch it with Tim and everybody

275
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:45,706
and just say, OK, does that work?

276
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:50,445
Does this work with the game?

277
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:51,385
Schafer: It's pretty important, I guess,

278
00:14:51,385 --> 00:14:52,743
that we figure out where everyone's standing.

279
00:14:52,743 --> 00:14:55,844
Because this is like the, like the final resting place for everyone, do you think?

280
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:57,110
Where we want them?

281
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,319
Petty: The witch is facing the wrong way.

282
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:01,506
She should be facing towards the cake, but we needed enough space

283
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:04,486
for you to be able to walk around without accidentally clicking on someone.

284
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,434
And that was, that was where we wound up.

285
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:10,104
Schafer: He could also be shoved facing left over here more.

286
00:15:10,104 --> 00:15:12,604
'Cause this thing is, this is a kind of unnecessary thing...

287
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:13,575
Petty: We can just paint that out.

288
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:15,904
Schafer: And it looks so prominent, that you kind of want to play with it,

289
00:15:15,904 --> 00:15:21,937
but you could use that shelf space, too, if he was like closer to it or something?

290
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:23,281
So you wouldn't be tempted to walk,

291
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:26,440
like you'd be tempted to walk this way around him instead of this way.

292
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,817
Petty: We could always put like little photos of,

293
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:30,668
maybe there's like little black and white photos of him

294
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:32,002
as a young warrior or something.

295
00:15:32,002 --> 00:15:35,031
Like he's staring at like his past, you know, or whatever.

296
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:37,138
If you want to put some little subtle stuff there.

297
00:15:37,138 --> 00:15:38,913
Schafer: OK.

298
00:15:38,913 --> 00:15:41,667
Offscreen Voice: Well, you know, we try to put as much in as we can,

299
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:43,827
because we're so limited on time.

300
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:48,503
So we know a lot of this stuff is going to change once we get final dialogue,

301
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:50,889
because we don't have the final actors.

302
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:54,115
We don't have those recordings and that can change a lot of the timing.

303
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:56,822
Garner: Famous people, like real actors?

304
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:01,494
They all read dialogue a lot slower than our scratch dialogue.

305
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:05,327
Our scratch dialogue is when we go in and do recordings

306
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:09,776
and we all sort of act out the characters.

307
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:14,590
Garner: Bring me a star chart and the fabric of time and space

308
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:19,267
shall be knit to serve your passage.

309
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:21,277
[Inaudible 00:16:19]

310
00:16:21,277 --> 00:16:24,120
Stamos: I came in this morning and Cam's like,

311
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,739
he said we need some more mom voice.

312
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:28,108
So I'm like, oh, all right.

313
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:29,781
I guess that's me.

314
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:34,034
Stoddard: I actually like, I really like, I like how you did the mom.

315
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:39,714
Stamos: Well, I'm reading it just as me, so since I am a mom, I guess that's OK.

316
00:16:39,714 --> 00:16:41,530
Stoddard: You got a good mom voice.

317
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,532
Rice: Is there anybody else on this ship?

318
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:49,926
So you've never seen a strange wolf around?

319
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,438
Stoddard: Well done. Rice: All right.

320
00:16:52,438 --> 00:16:57,756
Team Member: So we would like to try to get as much as could into these scenes

321
00:16:57,756 --> 00:17:00,396
without having to change everything entirely.

322
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:01,925
Once we get that final dialogue.

323
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:07,781
So we're kind of doing a lot of stuff that you would do sequentially, all at once.

324
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:09,304
Schafer: And they try not to do too much,

325
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:11,604
so you can tell some of them are animating more than they should there,

326
00:17:11,604 --> 00:17:13,638
because they just wanted to make a nice scene.

327
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:15,403
And soon we're going to file dialogue for all that,

328
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:19,510
so we'll be able to polish that up like we couldn't before.

329
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,551
Schafer: Should we just start listening to stuff.

330
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:23,731
Brown: Yeah, we can just go down the list.

331
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:25,619
Schafer: Let's do it.

332
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,108
Khris and I started working together at Lucas Arts in the '90s.

333
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:31,257
Like she started, Brown: 1990.

334
00:17:31,257 --> 00:17:34,506
Schafer: What was your first job title at Lucas Arts?

335
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:37,166
Brown: I was the Product Support Supervisor.

336
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,117
Schafer: Yeah, she was in Prod Sup, yeah.

337
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:44,486
And then, but the first thing you did sound on for me is Full Throttle, right?

338
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:47,091
Brown: Uh, Schafer: Or did Tentacle, no you were in...

339
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:48,094
Brown: Day of the Tentacle.

340
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:49,276
Schafer: You were in Day of the Tentacle.

341
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:53,380
Brown: We said dirty things to Mark Hamell in his headphones and that's true.

342
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,703
Schafer: We learned a lot.

343
00:17:54,703 --> 00:17:56,106
Brown: And we learned a lot.

344
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:57,347
Schafer: You've learned a lot since then.

345
00:17:57,347 --> 00:18:00,355
Super-professional mature now.

346
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:02,316
Let's listen to some more voices.

347
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:03,840
Schafer: I had a meeting with Khris

348
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,321
where I actually listened to the first auditions.

349
00:18:05,321 --> 00:18:07,546
So we listened to a whole bunch of auditions.

350
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:09,223
A few of them were good, but it's just the start.

351
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:11,320
We're going to listen to a whole lot more auditions.

352
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,495
We have a bunch of characters to cast.

353
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:18,034
Audition Voice: You came because you are done with children's games.

354
00:18:18,034 --> 00:18:23,653
My name is Merrick and what I'm about to show you is no game.

355
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:25,404
Schafer: Pretty good, but I think I like the other guy.

356
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,276
Audition Voice: David Kaufman Merrick. Schafer: Whoa.

357
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:31,681
Audition Voice: You came because you are done with children's games.

358
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:36,242
My name is Merrick and what I'm about to show you is no game.

359
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:40,156
While you've been drifting through the universe, eating ice cream

360
00:18:40,156 --> 00:18:45,571
and playing with trains, war has been raging across the galaxy.

361
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:51,340
Between the forces that every war is between, between the powerful and the weak,

362
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,860
the tyrants and the innocent.

363
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,111
Does it even matter there will always be war.

364
00:18:57,111 --> 00:19:01,305
We did not start it and we cannot stop it.

365
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:10,968
But what we can do is protect the weak and rescue the helpless.

366
00:19:10,968 --> 00:19:12,529
Schafer: That guy's pretty awesome.

367
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:14,419
Is it a higher pitch than I imagined him having?

368
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,310
But I love how he read it.

369
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,239
Schafer: Well, we had our first casting session.

370
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:22,653
Khris was on Skype and I was listening to all the auditions.

371
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:23,408
They were good.

372
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:26,258
There were a couple characters that I felt like, that's exactly right;

373
00:19:26,258 --> 00:19:28,198
we could use that voice.

374
00:19:28,198 --> 00:19:31,555
For a lot of them, and the main ones, I think it's going to be a longer process

375
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:33,457
where we just take the first listen

376
00:19:33,457 --> 00:19:36,685
and then Khris and I have something that we can talk to together.

377
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:38,971
Like where is this, instead of just reaching out in the dark,

378
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:41,000
we're like, OK, now we've heard a voice.

379
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,569
Is it older, younger than this?

380
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:45,161
Is it meaner or nicer than this?

381
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:48,611
You know, we can talk about all the different ways we want to use that

382
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:54,472
as a landmark to know, navigate to actual voice that we want.

383
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:59,032
Is that a good metaphor?

384
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,819
Schafer: OK. Well, we have a company meeting at 2:00 o'clock also.

385
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:03,160
Brown: Oh.

386
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,254
Schafer: Oh God. What do you think is the most important thing to listen to?

387
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:10,331
Brown: I think the most important things to listen to are Shay and Vella.

388
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:11,237
Schafer: Vella.

389
00:20:11,237 --> 00:20:13,438
Let's listen to some Vellas.

390
00:20:13,438 --> 00:20:19,745
Audition Voice: Need help cleaning up?

391
00:20:19,745 --> 00:20:20,586
Schafer: There's something wrong with that one.

392
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,503
I don't know what it is.

393
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:29,367
Audition Voice: Hi. Need help cleaning up?

394
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:31,820
Schafer: Not bad.

395
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,010
Audition Voice: I think it's time we start fighting that monster.

396
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,809
Schafer: It sounds really young to me, it's like her little sister,

397
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:39,939
but I don't know.

398
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,767
I'm trying to think of what 14 year old girls sound like.

399
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:52,532
Khris: There's a sample of a 15 year old girl and her audition is bitchy

400
00:20:52,532 --> 00:20:54,325
and I don't like it,

401
00:20:54,325 --> 00:21:00,175
but it just gives you an idea of what a 15 year old girl sounds like.

402
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,007
Audition Voice: What you got?

403
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:03,911
Let me see that.

404
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:06,579
Nah, I don't really need it that bad.

405
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:10,598
Schafer: Her acting is kind of a problem.

406
00:21:10,598 --> 00:21:14,465
Hm. OK. All right.

407
00:21:14,465 --> 00:21:17,070
Brown: Oh no! I hate to make you sad.

408
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:21,805
Do you want to hear all the "B" list ones that didn't get put up?

409
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:25,513
Schafer: Oh no, I was just saying, you know, I mean listen to them all.

410
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:27,127
Brown: We have tons of auditions.

411
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:28,899
Schafer: I know. I mean, is there anything really unique in there?

412
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:33,086
I guess I was looking for something that was kind of special, unique in some way.

413
00:21:33,086 --> 00:21:34,509
Brown: Special like?

414
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:36,689
Schafer: Super likable. They're all good.

415
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:37,969
I mean, they're all good.

416
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:41,148
They're all in the right, correct range, I think, in age for the most part,

417
00:21:41,148 --> 00:21:44,726
except for that one that sounded really young.

418
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:50,896
I guess I was looking for one with like a personality that would leap out at me.

419
00:21:50,896 --> 00:21:52,096
But I think it just takes time.

420
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:55,231
I think I just have to listen to them a whole bunch of times.

421
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:59,290
Brown: Yeah, but I don't want you to be like beat into submission,

422
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,227
beaten into submission,

423
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:03,765
like and reconcile yourself to something less than what you truly want, you know?

424
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:04,773
Schafer: When would I ever do that?

425
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:06,408
When would I ever let that happen?

426
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,509
Anyway, that's how it goes.

427
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:10,329
Schafer: You get the first listen and now Khris and I, whoa, [inaudible 00:22:08],

428
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:14,713
I spit all over my Rubik's cubes.

429
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:17,512
Yeah, no, she has a little clearer idea of what I think of each character

430
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:19,737
now that we have something to compare it to.

431
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:22,696
And I'm still, still pursuing some like, friends,

432
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:25,040
friends and famous people for the game.

433
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,324
We'll see where that goes.

434
00:22:26,324 --> 00:22:28,206
I don't want to say anything , 'cause what if it doesn't happen,

435
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:29,922
I'll just feel stupid.

436
00:22:29,922 --> 00:22:34,325
Schafer: Possible, one might say celebrity cameos in the game?

437
00:22:34,325 --> 00:22:36,498
Me, just me.

438
00:22:36,498 --> 00:22:39,393
Actual bona fide celebrities.

439
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:41,755
Offscreen Voice: People that we've used, actors that we've used before?

440
00:22:41,755 --> 00:22:42,983
Schafer: My hope is to use actually a lot of people

441
00:22:42,983 --> 00:22:44,777
that we have used before, just for some fun small parts,

442
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:51,240
like Richard Horovitz and Nicky Rapp and contact Mr. Black, see if he's available.

443
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,967
He offered to do that, like before.

444
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:54,054
Offscreen Voice: Oh, he did?

445
00:22:54,054 --> 00:23:03,090
Schafer: He said, Offscreen Voice: He should be the hipster lumberjack.

446
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,900
Petty: You know, last week I got some of the UI stuff cut up and integrated.

447
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,280
And I also got most of the way through doing the kind of like,

448
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,478
they're not implemented in the game yet, but the white box for all the Shellmound.

449
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:17,414
My goal is to get those all in the game and hooked up by end of the week.

450
00:23:17,414 --> 00:23:19,390
Petty: This is really kind of where a white box,

451
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,501
now we do have some basic layering set up here.

452
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:23,519
And I did some basic camera work.

453
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,944
But this shows the basic layout of the scene, the key elements in place.

454
00:23:26,944 --> 00:23:29,606
So these are, you know, just quick black and white drawings,

455
00:23:29,606 --> 00:23:35,382
but they, some of them like this, without going into too much detail,

456
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:38,213
this particular scene has a very strange layout in some ways

457
00:23:38,213 --> 00:23:40,648
because you have to see this sort of distant view of Shellmound,

458
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:42,755
because it sets up something that happens later.

459
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,396
So it really wasn't that any of these are

460
00:23:44,396 --> 00:23:46,410
the final shapes or languages or anything.

461
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,960
Or even really the final shot, as much to make sure that all those elements

462
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,682
had a place and could work together in a single screen composition.

463
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,753
So you kind of have to work at a certain level of detail

464
00:23:56,753 --> 00:23:59,447
just to be able to figure that out and to communicate that to Bagel.

465
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:03,382
Petty: My goal is to get all those all in the game and hooked by end of the week.

466
00:24:03,382 --> 00:24:05,096
Schafer: It will close, too.

467
00:24:05,096 --> 00:24:07,365
Being almost all white boxed.

468
00:24:07,365 --> 00:24:09,305
Camden, world of sound.

469
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:13,212
Stoddard: Last week it was mostly 
filling out space ship and there's still

470
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,020
a few glitches timing stuff that 
I have to work on and kind of tighten up.

471
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,480
Stoddard: Yeah.

472
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,640
It's a super high tech spaceship, 
but at the same time,

473
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,500
like I kind of think it would be kind of fun 
to like have stuff kind of squeaky

474
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,180
and you can hear the wheels and 
the joints working and things like that.

475
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:38,862
So I'm trying to get some 
elements with Laura's key card.

476
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,680
Laura: Ready? 
Stoddard: Yep.

477
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,360
Great. Awesome. 
Laura: Yeah, yeah? 
Stoddard: Perfect.

478
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,000
And I'm starting to do some things 
with like phase and modulation.

479
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,520
[Squeaky sounds].

480
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,640
Getting like this almost 
like alien machinery sound.

481
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,138
But I was also noticing 
some of its properties

482
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,900
I could do for like some of the robots.

483
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,060
Like almost chattering.

484
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,600
Schafer: Cool. Rusty?

485
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,060
Russell: Beginning of the week was 
mostly some prop stuff for the girl's house.

486
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:28,201
And then it's up to the Mog Chothra 
one so you get the textures done.

487
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:33,403
Russell: So Adrien was actually 
involved with doing the character modeling

488
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:36,683
and the rigging, but he went off to 
another project to help out.

489
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,360
Offscreen Voice: This was supposed to be a shot of you,

490
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,980
hard at work on another project.

491
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
[Laughter]

492
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,120
Skillman: The backers are going to love that.

493
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:53,039
Russell: But because they had a vacancy to fill because Adrien left,

494
00:25:54,563 --> 00:25:55,743
I'm the next guy up.

495
00:25:55,743 --> 00:25:56,363
So yeah.

496
00:25:57,706 --> 00:26:01,406
Some of the stuff I'm doing is 
just like going back through old files.

497
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:04,826
Like a lot of this stuff was made 
for the actual teaser trailer.

498
00:26:04,826 --> 00:26:09,326
And Adrien's got a lot of 
rigging things that he did for us

499
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:13,526
that in the meantime that some 
of these older rigs need to get updated with.

500
00:26:13,526 --> 00:26:17,826
So like this girl, this is the girl in the cake

501
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,546
that you probably saw in the trailer.

502
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,760
I'm adding actually the lower half 
of her body so that when she gets pulled out,

503
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,400
you know, she actually has 
a body that comes with it.

504
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,700
So he was also done 
pretty early on in the project,

505
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,540
so we kind of revamped him 
and revamped his skeleton.

506
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:39,514
So he's got some, some other controls 
now that you can kind of do a little parallax

507
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,719
so that if he's trying to turn, this part can,

508
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,080
you know, look like it's 
going behind him a little bit.

509
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,169
He's got the ability to 
open his jaw and stuff now.

510
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:59,369
Schafer: Jessie! Whoa! That's scary.

511
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,640
Schafer: I've actually been able to write now

512
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,563
so I wrote the Maidens Feast 
stuff as you saw

513
00:27:03,563 --> 00:27:07,043
and that's been delivered and 
Malena's putting that in the database right now.

514
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:09,863
And then the next thing I'm going 
to be working on, I think is Shellmound.

515
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,960
Schafer: I think I'm going 
to plunge ahead with it,

516
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,400
new stuff just to make sure 
no one's blocked by dialogue ever again.

517
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,480
Schafer: I hope that I get the 
dialogue done in the next month or two.

518
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,705
All of it done and then 
it'll just be me reviewing

519
00:27:23,705 --> 00:27:25,645
and redesigning and rewriting stuff.

520
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,120
Play testing.

521
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,760
Schafer: Holy crap. 
Bailey: I know.

522
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,700
I was playing Day of the Tentacle

523
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,621
and I was playing some of the other 
old games and I just noticed that

524
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:36,561
in a lot of those games 
there's multiple writers.

525
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,117
Is there a way to 
bring on a junior writer?

526
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,680
Schafer: I mean, I'm always open to that.

527
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,180
We did that on Psychonauts.

528
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,280
It's just always been, it's really 
been hard to find people

529
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,480
that do it exactly, exactly right.

530
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,680
And it's also, it's kind of time 
consuming to read a bunch of writing samples.

531
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,200
It's a possibility, like if some 
rock star writer just walked in the door

532
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,580
and was ready to go, 
I would be totally open to that.

533
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,860
This is where you cut to some 
rock star writer walking through the door.

534
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,160
Someone that actually looks like 
a rock star, but he's got pen and paper.

535
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,800
Petty: Would you rather 
have help there or in design?

536
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,707
Schafer: Well, design I can always get help

537
00:28:16,707 --> 00:28:19,365
by just having brainstorming 
sessions with people and having people,

538
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,565
you know, to talk to and to give ideas.

539
00:28:21,565 --> 00:28:24,445
Everybody's got like a 
lot of ideas to offer.

540
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,900
Petty: We had the ax, which I 
presume he could just hand you.

541
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,664
And he makes a stool, 
you could make here.

542
00:28:34,817 --> 00:28:36,857
There's a bathroom 
where you get the stool.

543
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,280
That'll be the only part of this meeting 
that Paul puts on the next episode.

544
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,280
Rice: Well, I mean, how are feeling?

545
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,200
Schafer: I think what I want 
to do is put all those cuts in

546
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,340
and really just do a puzzle graph,

547
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,309
where I'm looking at all the 
puzzles that are in the game,

548
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:58,522
and counting them and 
see how many we have,

549
00:28:58,522 --> 00:29:01,002
how that compares to past 
games and kind of hours of game play.

550
00:29:01,002 --> 00:29:04,321
'Cause I don't want to have a 
game that's like, you know, three hours long.

551
00:29:04,321 --> 00:29:05,961
I just want to make sure that 
we're still having that puzzle count...

552
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:07,040
Rice: You see, that's funny to me,

553
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,698
because it seems like you're 
always complaining about long games.

554
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,765
It seems like everyone in the 
office enjoys short experiences.

555
00:29:12,765 --> 00:29:15,101
Schafer: Well, there's short and then 
there's like, holy crap,

556
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:17,395
I can't believe they took 
two years to make this game.

557
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,540
Rice: Yeah.

558
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,540
But I mean, the longer you go, 
the just like more dilute it gets, right?

559
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:29,271
And just in general it seems like 
favoring a well-polished core experience over,

560
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,754
Schafer: I'm not talking 
about those kind of things.

561
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,922
I'm not talking about diluting it.

562
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:34,653
I'm saying like, like we, 
Rice: But it's what we're doing, right?

563
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:36,060
Schafer: No, i'm not, hold on-

564
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,700
Rice: There's only a certain amount, 
Schafer: Shh.

565
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,880
Let me get this out.

566
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,010
Like Lee and I were talking, like in Stacking.

567
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,100
We talked about Stacking.

568
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,387
The content of stacking is not low, 
like there's tons of density

569
00:29:47,387 --> 00:29:49,043
and tons of characters and stuff like that.

570
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:52,624
And we used to talk about 
ways of it trying to extend,

571
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,051
like there's content people just 
miss when they go through it,

572
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,972
that possibly mechanically

573
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,882
we could have brought more 
into the critical path of the game, right?

574
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:04,022
And it always be, no matter 
what we do when we ship,

575
00:30:04,022 --> 00:30:05,682
there'll be a big call, like it's too short

576
00:30:05,682 --> 00:30:07,262
because people always complain about it

577
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,116
especially adventure games being 
too short because they rush through them.

578
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,566
You know, some people want to rush through them,

579
00:30:11,566 --> 00:30:13,122
and then they're like, ah, it's too short.

580
00:30:13,122 --> 00:30:15,069
Rice: I do think it's a 
recent phenomenon, though.

581
00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:17,920
People arguing the other way.

582
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,440
Schafer: We're not going to be 
able to make this game too long.

583
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,720
There's nothing we can do to make 
this game feel too long or be too long,

584
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,470
because you just cannot extend 
that content, that's hand-made in that way.

585
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,076
We have no systems 
that we could accidentally

586
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,900
turn the screws on and 
all of a sudden make it.

587
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,340
Rice: Yeah, I guess I'm just, don't 
see it as an issue if it feels short.

588
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,057
Schafer: I do, but I do.

589
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,720
I think there's a certain value proposition.

590
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:45,251
Like a ripped off feeling if it's not, 
you know, there's definitely a minimum.

591
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,500
Rice: We only have so much money 
to spend and so much time on this game,

592
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,772
so like, the more content we put in, 
the less time we have to polish it.

593
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,132
So it's a delicate balance.

594
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,967
But I think he's just, he just 
doesn't want us to like finish

595
00:30:56,967 --> 00:31:00,368
and we do a full play-test of the 
game and it's like two hours long.

596
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,943
And it just feels empty, but like, 
there's no way that's going to happen.

597
00:31:04,943 --> 00:31:09,542
Like I'm, I'm pretty sure it's 
going to be like 8, 10 hours,

598
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:11,282
just based on what we've seen.

599
00:31:11,282 --> 00:31:12,707
Rice: Yeah, and I think Full Throttle's

600
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:15,093
the one specifically people 
always call out to him,

601
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,717
and I think it is, 'cause it is a more 
like linear narrative kind of,

602
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,620
like I don't feel like I got 
stuck a ton in Full Throttle.

603
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,640
And I don't think anyone who'd 
play it now would say it's short.

604
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,293
Rice: We are making an 8, 10 hour 
game maybe, who knows?

605
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,386
But like either way, we're 
making an hour of music

606
00:31:34,386 --> 00:31:36,089
so it's not going to fill the whole game.

607
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:42,000
So does that mean we have 
parts that don't have music?

608
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,540
That rely on ambience?

609
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:50,221
Does that mean we write extra 
music like we did with Cloud Colony?

610
00:31:50,221 --> 00:31:54,201
But it seems like there's conflicting
opinions between people on the team.

611
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,580
Schafer: Between Brian and Peter? 
Rice: Yeah.

612
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,680
Min: It's just that things like we 
have the Cloud Colony, for example,

613
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,401
where we made changes, 
McConnell: Right.

614
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:06,334
Min: so like, you know, a month 
goes by, we have to keep moving.

615
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:11,091
But you know, we couldn't get feedback
from you so there's inefficiencies there so,

616
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:14,129
McConnell: I think, but I didn't know 
there was feedback to give.

617
00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:17,289
I think we, I do think we need to 
revisit the Cloud Colony stuff

618
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:21,802
because quite honestly, the new 
version doesn't work for me.

619
00:32:21,802 --> 00:32:23,572
It feels too fast.

620
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,317
It doesn't feel drifty and floaty anymore.

621
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,649
And you know, I ran it by 
Tim and he felt the same way.

622
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:33,836
Min: You have to understand where 
I'm coming from, I'm trying to meet deadlines

623
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,695
to make sure that we have 
certain things, certain momentum.

624
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,036
So the creative feedback 
is nothing personal,

625
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,317
we're not trying to inject 
our own kind of thing.

626
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,205
McConnell: Well, Brian, listen.

627
00:32:42,205 --> 00:32:43,085
I understand totally.

628
00:32:43,085 --> 00:32:44,335
You were just trying to solve a problem.

629
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,649
Min: Yes. That's exactly right.

630
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:49,222
McConnell: The responsibility 
for not checking the game sooner,

631
00:32:49,222 --> 00:32:51,215
it'll never happen again.

632
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,767
Stoddard: Well, clearly the workflow 
needs better communication from here on out,

633
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,180
between the four of us.

634
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,340
McConnell: Yeah, totally.

635
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,340
Stoddard: Pete is contracted only 
for a certain amount of music

636
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,273
and we have to find a way to stretch it out,

637
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,878
because the game's going to 
need a lot more time than that.

638
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,682
McConnell: You know, how do you cover,

639
00:33:11,682 --> 00:33:13,958
how do you cover all the 
ground that you need to cover?

640
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,152
I mean, that's really what's behind this question, right? Min: Yeah.

641
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,867
Rice: So Peter, I was talking to Brian about this

642
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:23,223
and I think it is actually a lot, 
McConnell: It's an important question!

643
00:33:23,223 --> 00:33:24,323
Rice: Yeah, and I think it's actually really similar

644
00:33:24,323 --> 00:33:26,723
to what we've been facing with the art team.

645
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,715
'Cause you know, when we started 
out on this game the whole idea

646
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,013
was that it was going to be 
a really tiny adventure game

647
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,335
and Bagel was going to draw every
 character and every environment in the game.

648
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,160
McConnell: Right.

649
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,000
Rice: And obviously it's just 
a much larger game now

650
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,640
to where he can't do all of the art.

651
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,120
So we've had to expand the art team 
and figure out how to make that work

652
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,140
and how to make the game feel like 
it all looks like what Bagel would do,

653
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,375
even though there's been 
a lot of hands touching it.

654
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,590
It's going to be a matter of 
getting pieces from you that essentially

655
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:59,105
feel like concepts for this is 
what Cloud Colony music sounds like

656
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:00,988
and this is everywhere it goes.

657
00:34:00,988 --> 00:34:03,575
And then we let Brian and 
Camden run with it a bit

658
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,711
and just keep throwing stuff 
over to you to see if you like

659
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,491
the direction that they're 
kind of expanding things.

660
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,301
McConnell: I mean, I actually think 
it's going to be an interesting problem

661
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:19,881
to solve, to you know, work with 
you guys to make this score bigger.

662
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,426
So I mean, I'm looking forward to it.

663
00:34:22,426 --> 00:34:27,925
I'm not seeing this as a, you know, 
I just see it as what we're dealing with

664
00:34:27,925 --> 00:34:32,905
and something that has interesting, 
you know, an interesting challenge.

665
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:45,620
[Music]

666
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,940
McConnell: Back in Boston, 
after I got out of college,

667
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,780
one of my housemates in Boston was Michael Land.

668
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,280
And we worked together at, and he 
later became the Sound Director at Lucas.

669
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:59,839
I saved up some money and 
quit my job at Lexcon

670
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,484
and drove out West and 
the idea was to, you know, start a band.

671
00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:08,119
Well, by the time I got here, he 
had gotten his job at Lucasarts

672
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,912
and so you know, 
you got to check this out.

673
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,466
I got involved in that 
and first as a consultant and then,

674
00:35:14,466 --> 00:35:17,426
and then, you know, 
I joined the Sound Department.

675
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,740
And he definitely helped get 
me started in game music.

676
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,840
So I'm very grateful to him.

677
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,700
My biggest tool for really starting 
is this handheld thing here.

678
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,820
I just walk around and hum stuff into it.

679
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
[sings notes from Star Wars theme]

680
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,380
If I do any more, we'll have to pay John Williams.

681
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,721
You know, I know how to operate this thing.

682
00:35:41,721 --> 00:35:43,244
Ah, gee, that's a pretty catchy tune.

683
00:35:43,244 --> 00:35:44,877
Maybe I should, maybe I should use that one.

684
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,610
So I would hum into this machine.

685
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:51,173
Then come back to it and 
see if I still liked the melody.

686
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,722
I'm a big melody guy.

687
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,260
You really need to go home whistling something.

688
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,296
If the person who listens to it, 
if they're a musician or not,

689
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,420
they're going to sit there and hum it later.

690
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:05,967
For Psychonauts, I used to send Tim, 
you know, little MP3 files of you know,

691
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:07,607
hey, here's what I'm working on, Tim.

692
00:36:07,607 --> 00:36:12,147
You know, 
[Hums a theme] 
Great.

693
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,600
I think I'll have to hear it more in context.

694
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:27,640
[Music]

695
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,766
McConnell: So then the next 
stage would be to actually

696
00:36:29,766 --> 00:36:31,291
sort of work it out at the piano.

697
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,220
And notate it.

698
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,804
Broken Age is a really 
interesting one, actually.

699
00:36:35,804 --> 00:36:38,424
I think it's one of the hardest 
scores I've ever done,

700
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,473
because in something like 
Grim Fandango there are,

701
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,984
there're sort of recognizable worlds 
with, with sort of little plums of you know,

702
00:36:46,984 --> 00:36:54,784
this is sort of central American city 
with a noire, an art deco vibe to it.

703
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,680
This is a dock, like in the Maltese Falcon.

704
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,572
There're real specific cultural 
references in that and Psychonauts,

705
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,540
there're really specific cultural references.

706
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,840
And if there weren't, 
I stuck them in there.

707
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:15,660
But Broken Age is, it's a fable about 
a very, a completely imaginary world.

708
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,500
The village, the Meriloft, the spaceship;

709
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,137
they're these very, they're 
worlds unto themselves.

710
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,840
And so I'm really trying to find sounds 
that are also sounds unto themselves.

711
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,694
My initial feeling was that the 
town needed to have this sort of

712
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:39,193
combination of maybe an African 
sort of vibe and also a Scandinavian vibe.

713
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,912
One of the Scandinavian instruments 
that I was interested in is called a kantele,

714
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,260
and it's a dulcimer, hammer 
dulcimer-like instrument.

715
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,592
So I have a kantele sample here.

716
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,160
A lot of these samples are going 
to get replaced by real instruments.

717
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,320
The autoharp was another one.

718
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,706
[Music]

719
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,300
McConnell: And that's the kantele.

720
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:01,940
Cello.

721
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:09,940
Kalimba, which is a, this is a kalimba.

722
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,180
I'll play it in a second.

723
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,240
It's a, also known as the thumb piano.

724
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,798
It has these little tines that you pluck with your [demonstrates].

725
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,980
And then it has these little holes 
that allow you to give it sort of a vibrato.

726
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,940
And that's a traditional African instrument.

727
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,918
[Music]

728
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,540
McConnell: And so here you have the flute.

729
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,620
It's really spare.

730
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,520
It seemed like a lonely scene.

731
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,692
[Music]

732
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,880
McConnell: That's sort of the whole ensemble.

733
00:38:51,880 --> 00:39:00,200
You hear violin, you hear, that's 
a kora sample, which is aâ€¦

734
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,781
McConnell: So this is a 
combination of the African sound

735
00:39:06,781 --> 00:39:11,341
and then we have kind of a European fiddle.

736
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,320
[Music]

737
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,891
McConnell: So that's, that's 
you know, that's sort of the first pass.

738
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,080
It may be really different, you know,
when we're finally done.

739
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,925
Composing for games, 
you know, it's a little cliche,

740
00:39:26,925 --> 00:39:28,218
but it's different from other media

741
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:32,954
because when you write music 
for film, no one is, you aren't,

742
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,860
you aren't, building the theater 
and redesigning the projector every time.

743
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,926
With games, you pretty much are.

744
00:39:40,926 --> 00:39:43,413
You're at least redesigning the projector.

745
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,692
It helps to be involved in the 
actual technical aspect of things,

746
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:52,544
not just throwing the, the music over 
the wall and hoping that it gets put in OK.

747
00:39:52,544 --> 00:39:54,322
And then checking it out later.

748
00:39:54,322 --> 00:39:55,872
I mean, that's a great way to do things

749
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,952
and sometimes it's kind of what we have to do,

750
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,880
because we're all, you know, 
under the schedule pressure and so on.

751
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,947
But sometimes it's nice to 
be able to actually get your,

752
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:09,487
roll up your sleeves, 
get your hands into the game.

753
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,659
Really see firsthand what's 
not working about it.

754
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:18,456
Make a change and then 
five minutes later you know,

755
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,320
there it is, the way you want to hear it.

756
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,498
McConnell: I'm just going to see if I can

757
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,760
actually get a signal in this system here.

758
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,549
I really have no idea what I'm going to do, 
actually, to be honest to be with you.

759
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:41,648
But I'm, I've been trying, 
playing some violin into it.

760
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:44,548
And then I'm just going to look at a
couple of other sounds I might use

761
00:40:44,548 --> 00:40:48,743
and see if I can make sort of a, 
little bit of a score here.

762
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:56,340
[Music] 
McConnell: OK, so that's a good place to start.

763
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:08,580
[Music]

764
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:11,518
McConnell: Those little sounds 
you hear in the background

765
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,060
are things that I played on the violin already.

766
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,657
I have a little bit of 
a synthesizer bed now.

767
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:27,100
I'm going to play, I'm going to 
play some violin to it.

768
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:33,316
I'm not playing to a click, so this is just 
sort of a free, free ambient thing.

769
00:41:33,912 --> 00:42:04,092
[Music]

770
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,420
McConnell: My Prime Time is broken.

771
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,020
Oh, nice. I think it's not broken.

772
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:27,080
And it's like, I'm not quite sure why we're not, oh.

773
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,982
So I've set up a sample and hold loop.

774
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:38,031
By plucking the violin, it's going 
through this old Lexcon Prime Time,

775
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:44,360
which is now sampling and holding that sound 
and making a repeating echo out of it.

776
00:42:45,126 --> 00:42:48,506
And I sort of like this kind of 
heartbeat thing that's going on.

777
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:54,020
And I've pitched it down by 
an octave, by messing with the,

778
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,520
this was the original sound.

779
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,920
So I'm just going to record that.

780
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:37,200
[Music]

781
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,900
McConnell: And I don't know if 
that's what we'll use for that scene,

782
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,764
but it might be something like that.

783
00:43:43,764 --> 00:43:45,064
And it's a huge score.

784
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,440
There're three of us working on it.

785
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,876
So we'll be taking my ProTools 
files with the midi information in them,

786
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,700
re-voiced with different synth sounds, 
do different remixes.

787
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,699
And this is something that we're evolving,

788
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,763
you know, we're working on it 
right now, exactly how it's working.

789
00:44:03,763 --> 00:44:07,203
So it's, you know, it's 
definitely paving new ground.

790
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:12,860
McConnell: You know, one 
thing about working hard at music is,

791
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:21,475
is your head does get cluttered a lot 
with all the parameters and the deadlines

792
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,700
and you know, am I going to do it 
this way or am I going to do that way?

793
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,797
And when am I ever going to 
get rid of that awful synth sound I'm using?

794
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,680
And all that kind of stuff, it just 
kind of melts away when you,

795
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,380
when you come up here 
and get a little perspective on things.

796
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:43,840
I think in some sense music is 
an imitation of nature or the world around us.

797
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:51,720
And I just really like to be here 
whenever I can make it up the hill.

798
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,472
Because it is a little reminiscent 
of the field that the girl starts out in,

799
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,520
now isn't it?

800
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,580
When I did that theme, 
we hadn't moved yet.

801
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:06,580
So I sort of had to imagine 
that field and work to the picture.

802
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:19,080
But you know, the idea of a, of a 
beautiful field with solitude that you can go to,

803
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,956
to just get away from everything 
and we have a little village below,

804
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,540
it's definitely, you know, definitely resonates.

805
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,762
So maybe now that we're 
moving back to the girl's world,

806
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:34,282
maybe it's time for me 
to take more of these walks.

Schafer: Whoo! Full functionality. Ship it.

809
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,700
I think we should ship it at the end of the week.

810
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,120
I just really want to ship it. Ship it.

811
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,191
Anything else? No? OK. Thanks, everybody.

Schafer: That was the most 
funny thing about him, is he gets,

814
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,591
I've never seen anyone get madder 
at computers than Peter McConnell

815
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,094
God fucking dammit!

816
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,926
Like he gets so, 'cause nothing else

817
00:47:01,926 --> 00:47:04,202
about his personality is like that way, rage-y.

818
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:08,960
But when like a machine, when 
a computer won't do something, he gets so mad.

819
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,480
It's always fun to see him.

820
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,840
Oh, man, I was hoping you'd capture that.
