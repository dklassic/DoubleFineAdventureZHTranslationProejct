1
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,899
Schafer: It's mostly blank.

2
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:30,399
Schafer: Here's the
Double Fine Adventure stuff.

3
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,833
Let's see how far I got. Let's see.

4
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,399
It was interesting because I
didn't have any ideas for the game.

5
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,100
You know, I was just thinking
what it was going to be about.

6
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,000
And on the first day
I sat down and wrote.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,666
There's nothing on the first page.

8
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,633
And then I write about
the end of the second page.

9
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:48,633
The start of the third page, basically
I had the idea of the entire game.

10
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:51,000
[music]

11
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:20,466
Schafer: March 13th.

12
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:22,766
Offscreen Voice: It's been
exactly a month, actually.

13
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:24,433
Schafer: Oh, it's been exactly a month.
What happened since then?

14
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:27,433
Schafer: It's funny.

15
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:31,666
I told people, everyone, a lot of people thought
that we'd already had an idea for a game.

16
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,666
Dutton: I guess what we know about it,

17
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:36,200
it's going to be 2-D and it's
going to be kind of old school.

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,466
Can you give us any other little
tidbits about what you've got in store?

19
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:44,500
Schafer: I was just trying to
think of a fake tidbit to give you,

20
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
like it's all going to
be about chinchillas.

21
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,000
Did I mention that?
I mean, it's obvious.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,533
As soon as you
said "old school adventure",

23
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:51,500
it's going to be mostly
chinchilla based, lot of fur tech.

24
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,299
There's going to be a
lot of nudity, super-violent.

25
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:59,633
It's going to be the
first actual snuff game.

26
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:02,133
I think that's pretty out, that
was clear in the Kickstarter pitch.

27
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,599
Dutton: Who are you going to kill?

28
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,033
Schafer: The team.

29
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:06,900
Dutton: All of them? 
Ron, as well?

30
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,199
Schafer: Yeah. He's only
half alive right now anyway.

31
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,900
A lot of people thought
we had an idea for a game

32
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,766
or a game all designed, ready to go.

33
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,400
And they're like,
of course, they're not idiots.

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,900
They're going to have
something ready to go.

35
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,099
And I was like, no.

36
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,000
'Cause I want to do
all this, like you know,

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,433
we're going to document everything
and start when the cameras are rolling.

38
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,199
We're going to document the whole thing.

39
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,800
And so I didn't have an idea.

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,000
And I was a little scared, except for, 
I think it's just because

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,966
now I've been you know,
doing this for a long time.

42
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:32,166
I have, you got a
certain amount of faith

43
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,866
that you will sit down
and the ideas will come.

44
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:37,400
Because they come if
you just put enough time

45
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,366
sitting down with the notebook, writing.

46
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:40,733
Something will happen.

47
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:42,699
And this is like the
first entry in the notebook.

48
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:48,500
It's dated 3-15, which I think
is the day, it's the day after it closed.

49
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,966
This morning I came in and this is like

50
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:58,266
the first time I've I had a day
after the Kick Starter ended.

51
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:02,366
So I thought I'd just actually get to
work on this game that we're working on.

52
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:06,233
So the first thing I do when I'm
working on a game, is I start writing.

53
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:09,766
These are all my notebooks.

54
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:14,233
I just started a new notebook 
and it's already covered with stickers.

55
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:17,233
And I start writing, so...

56
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:24,000
And I sat down, and the first page is me
thinking about a code name for the game.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,833
Then I'm talking about some girls 
in the sixth grade for some reason.

58
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,933
And then I'm complaining
about my memory problems.

59
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:34,933
It's about like, the process of
getting ideas out of your head.

60
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:37,066
So when I'm really
disciplined and on it,

61
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:40,300
I will come in every morning 
and lock myself in my office

62
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,166
and just do free writing.

63
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,666
And free writing is something I
actually learned in junior high school,

64
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:49,966
but I started doing a lot in college

65
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:53,400
because it's the way of getting
past that hump of like the blank page.

66
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,366
It's kind of intimidating. 
Want me show you one?

67
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:56,666
Scary!

68
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,766
What do you put on here? 
Oh, god, you know.

69
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:03,500
And then, and then I'm like going over 
this list of old ideas, like what.

70
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,800
And then I'm talking about
whether I should hire this person,

71
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,633
but then, because like, this is ,

72
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:09,400
this is where I sit down in
the morning and I start writing.

73
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,266
And I have to keep writing. And
that's why ridiculous things come out.

74
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:16,033
And I started this morning for the first
time on Double Fine Adventure.

75
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:18,733
Double Fine Adventure Adventure.

76
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,632
I don't even want to
show you what I'm writing,

77
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:24,800
because someone's going to like download
it and be like, I've decoded the first notes.

78
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,733
And now I start talking about the game.

79
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:30,433
And now I start thinking about, 
should I do this idea?

80
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:32,433
I've been thinking
about this, this idea.

81
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:34,366
I've been thinking about
this idea and then right here,

82
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:35,933
you can see there's
a little star and a line,

83
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:37,699
like this is where I had
the idea for the game.

84
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:40,033
So at least, it took
at least three pages.

85
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:47,733
Schafer: Well, I can't tell you that,
because I'm not sure if I like it or not.

86
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:50,899
And it seemed like, sometimes it seems
like you're not having any ideas,

87
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:53,666
but you realize as you go over
the last week there are like,

88
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,600
every day had some little tiny
thing that moved it forward.

89
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,566
And it's like you've got
to move forward a little bit,

90
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:00,933
because you get to that next
deep well of ideas, you know.

91
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,899
The first day, the
most productive day like,

92
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:05,500
oh, it can fit together
like this. This is great.

93
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,100
And then, then I get
a couple more ideas.

94
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,466
You can see the
stars and the stars here.

95
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:14,300
And there're some days
where no stars happen.

96
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:20,100
And I start writing the name ideas
down here as you've seen before.

97
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,833
Because I do a lot, you do a lot of name
brainstorming where you just write,

98
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,899
ah, write down all these dumb names,
trying to come up the name of the character.

99
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:30,833
I remember there's a page where
I came up with the name Grim Fandango

100
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,000
and wrote it really big and
I was pretty excited about it.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,366
Here's a copy of my
notebook for Grim Fandango.

102
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:41,333
Let's see. Here's me
talking about Mexican folklore

103
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,533
and then here's me trying to
figure out the name of the game.

104
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:44,933
Dead Leads. Deadly Deeds.

105
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:47,233
Deeds of Death. Death's Deeds.

106
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:49,766
Here's trying to come
up with ideas for the name.

107
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,899
Reapers Holiday. Reapers
Road Trip. Reapers Rendezvous.

108
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:54,833
Reapers Last Ride. Reapers
Road. Trail of the Reaper.

109
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,899
Tools of the Reaper. Death as
a Salesman. Oh, that's been taken.

110
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,566
Reaper Man. That's
pretty good, Reaper Man.

111
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:02,333
The Remorseful Reaper. Bone to Lose.

112
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,166
Glen Gary Glen Reaper. Fear the Reaper.

113
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,800
Growl Reaper. Dougie
Reaper. Dougie Reaper?

114
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,866
Reaping Ivy. Bony
Manifesto. Friendly Reaper.

115
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:13,933
Chimp Reaper. 
That would have been good.

116
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,866
Oh, no. Not again.

117
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:19,066
Grim Journey. Hungry Hunted. 
The Last Reap. The Final Reap.

118
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:20,800
I put a box around the Last Reap.

119
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,833
Like that must have been
a favorite idea for a while.

120
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,666
Grim Reaper. Grim Reaper. 
I'm still doing it.

121
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,666
You can tell my
fear is starting to mount,

122
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:32,566
as I'm like, am I ever going to come
up with a name for this game?

123
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:36,133
Oh my God. Ah!  
Something otherworld.

124
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:38,533
Something figures. 
The Last Fiesta. Grim Fandango.

125
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:42,933
I'm such a fucking genius.

126
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:46,100
Ah, you can see what a relief that was.

127
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,500
Offscreen Voice: I guess it's been a real long
time since you made a 2-D adventure game.

128
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,466
Schafer: Um hm.

129
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:53,533
Dutton: But do you
think you've still got it?

130
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:57,166
Like, you still, are you still
in touch with those skills?

131
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,833
Schafer: And actually
I've been doing like,

132
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:02,666
I've been doing these interviews
and surveys and you know,

133
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:06,433
discussions, like you know, about
trying to figure out adventure games,

134
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:10,433
history and what was good and bad 
and what we can change about them.

135
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:11,699
Wolpaw: These are all the
ones you made, right?

136
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,633
And along the wall? 
Grim Fandango? I played Grim Fandango.

137
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:20,133
Monkey Island, didn't play. 
Day of the Tentacle, I didn't play.

138
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:22,033
Full Throttle, I didn't. 
Psychonauts is good.

139
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:25,466
Schafer: Yeah, yeah.
The writing was half good.

140
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:29,166
Wolpaw: Yeah. There was... 
half of it was pretty good.

141
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:35,366
But yeah. I don't know.
You're making an adventure game.

142
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:38,833
You going to do something
different to make it better?

143
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,933
Schafer: I'm trying to split up
what was good about them

144
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:43,166
and what was, what have we
learned since and what was better.

145
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,766
What could be made better about them.

146
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:48,000
'Cause I don't want to make
it just like a nostalgia thing.

147
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,033
Schafer: I think it's interesting to think about
why people like adventure games.

148
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:54,699
And really what they like about them.

149
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:59,033
Not just like someone who remembers, 
Monkey Island from like,

150
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:01,600
oh, when I was 12 I played Monkey Island.
I'd love to go play that again.

151
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,466
But who are actually playing them now
and like what they actually enjoy about them.

152
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:08,800
Gilbert: Why is that a game like,
you know, Monkey Island or Maniac Mansion

153
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,766
that was made, you know, 20 years ago,

154
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:13,966
why is it that people
still love those games?

155
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:17,266
Why is it that people post
hundreds of videos on YouTube

156
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:20,533
of themselves playing the
music from those games?

157
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,666
What, what was it about those that,

158
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:27,333
that really was so interesting
and touched people like that?

159
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,933
Gilbert: So is a lot of the interest that
people have today in adventure games,

160
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:35,100
is that more, do you think
that's more nostalgia based?

161
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,265
Because there're a lot of people
who love adventure games,

162
00:08:38,265 --> 00:08:44,032
but do they love the nostalgia of them
as opposed to the actual adventure games?

163
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:48,366
Gilbert: You know, you want to do
something that really focuses on

164
00:08:48,366 --> 00:08:52,000
what made those old point-and-click
adventure games a lot of fun

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and I mean, there's just like a rabid fan base
for those things as we obviously saw.

166
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,833
So you know, you really want
to take from those games

167
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,366
what made them really special.

168
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,399
But I also don't think you just want to

169
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,266
go make a 2-D
point-and-click adventure game,

170
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:13,899
you know, with the little cursor
that moves around and all that.

171
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:17,433
Because I could never go back 
and just design Monkey Island again,

172
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:21,299
because I'm a different person today, 
you know, than I was back then.

173
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:24,799
The world has changed. Gamers have
changed, you know, we've changed.

174
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,433
And so there's a lot, I think there's
a lot that has to evolve in them

175
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:33,733
and you know, I don't know exactly what
those are off the top of my head.

176
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:36,933
But they do need to evolve, 
but they need to evolve in such a way

177
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:39,533
that they don't lose the spirit of them

178
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:44,066
and they don't lose what made
them so interesting to people.

179
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:46,033
Schafer: The things that came up most,

180
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:50,500
when we talked about what was good about
adventure games were the pacing of them.

181
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,866
I think that's important that people 
like a game that moves at their pace.

182
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:57,100
I mean, obviously story and characters, 
even though the games have those,

183
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:05,000
I still think adventure games are the genre
that still puts them as the number one thing.

184
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:08,133
Schafer: Hi, guys. 
I'm late for another meeting.

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,299
Schafer: You can talk
about now or back then.

186
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:13,299
What you remember as the like,

187
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:16,766
dislike the most about adventure games
and the most frustrating moments you had?

188
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:19,700
Who wants to answer that one first?

189
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,600
Chi: Pixel hunting, for sure. 
That was really frustrating.

190
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,566
Schafer: Do you remember
an example of that?

191
00:10:27,566 --> 00:10:31,166
Chi: I think it was either in A King's Quest
or Gabriel Knight game.

192
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,033
Schafer: It's going to seem fishy

193
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,733
if you only pick Sierra
games for the bad example.

194
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,266
Chi: Well, that's, that's the thing.

195
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:39,899
Because the Lucas Arts
games had the same thing.

196
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,299
Schafer: I've already
apologized for that one.

197
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:44,299
Schafer: One of the interesting
advantages of adventure,

198
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:46,666
well, I was thinking about the, 
a lot of people I talked to

199
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,866
had the same experience
of early adventure,

200
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:52,833
the first adventure game experience
was like this promise of infinite possibility.

201
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,600
LeBreton: When I first started
playing adventure games,

202
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,799
I was like a kid and I didn't
really understand games.

203
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,500
Games were still magical
to me so I'd boot it up

204
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,066
and I had no idea of what to expect. 
Like I had a Commodore 64.

205
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:04,133
You know, just like, I don't know,

206
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:06,966
it just created this feeling of completely
crazy, open-ended possibility.

207
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:10,000
Schafer: That's hard to still
execute on that promise of

208
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,233
infinite possibility I think with
a modern adventure game.

209
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:15,399
When you were playing Machinarium
you don't have that feeling like,

210
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:18,133
I'm Mr. Robot and I can do
whatever I want in this world.

211
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:21,700
It's more like this game about
finding where the interaction is

212
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,399
and what are the, what are all the
interactions I can have in this world.

213
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,933
Dvorsky: It should be more
about playing with the game

214
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:32,600
than trying to beat it
as soon as possible.

215
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,766
So you should be able to enjoy
some places and situations,

216
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:43,333
even for several times,
even if you solved it already.

217
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:47,299
It should be fun to
play that little puzzle

218
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:53,166
or little interactive toy,
again just for fun.

219
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:56,133
Wolpaw: I mean, I like that they
have a, that they were funny.

220
00:11:56,133 --> 00:12:00,399
They're kind of whimsical. I guess
I just didn't like the puzzles maybe.

221
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,200
Schafer: Puzzles.

222
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,600
So you would say you would never
advocate a game that had puzzles in it?

223
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,333
Wolpaw: No. No.

224
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,100
Schafer: Like Portal, for example.

225
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,899
Schafer: One of the big
questions was whether or not

226
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,066
games should have puzzles
in them, in adventure games.

227
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:17,133
That came up when we were talking to
the Super Brothers, Craig and Chris.

228
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:20,899
About Sword and Sorcery, about how
when they played the old adventure games

229
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:23,233
the thing that didn't hold
up for them was the puzzles,

230
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:25,333
because there were
these blocks to the flow.

231
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,000
They really wanted the flow to happen.

232
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,866
Adams: And actually those types of
mechanics, that sort of inventory puzzles,

233
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:34,933
are things that I don't miss
from older adventure games.

234
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:37,266
What I love about older
adventure games is that there's,

235
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:39,399
you have a flow and there's
a story and there's characters.

236
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,100
And it just kind of surprises you.

237
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,133
And it was never figuring out, you know,

238
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:46,866
which little pixel and which screen 
do I combine with the other.

239
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:50,100
So, but we tried to
make it more just flow.

240
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,133
Schafer: I thought about
that for a long time.

241
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:56,033
It was like, is that, are puzzles an
antiquated, you know, notion for these games?

242
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:58,600
Are they a block to the narrative flow?

243
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,200
But I felt like in the end that wasn't
the case for the game we were making.

244
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,399
I think the game they were
making was a really specific,

245
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,533
like for what they wanted to make,

246
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:09,399
it wouldn't have suited their purposes
to have a bunch of like, head scratchers.

247
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:11,833
Piotrowski: But that was
really a challenging moment.

248
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,633
It was kind of like trying to
shed some of those things that

249
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:16,533
were like buried in our heads from
playing all these games when we were kids.

250
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:18,766
Schafer: Like what, talking
about adventure games,

251
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:20,733
people's memories of playing adventure
games when they were kids.

252
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,033
So many of them were like, that's
the only thing I had to do that summer.

253
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:26,533
I got stuck in my grandma's house for the summer
and I played Day of the Tentacle every day.

254
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:31,333
Like, I mean, people have so many
options now for entertainment.

255
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,500
It's going to be really
hard to make sure that

256
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,166
there's something really sticky about the game
that makes them want to come back.

257
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,766
I think a lot of that
is atmosphere. For me.

258
00:13:39,766 --> 00:13:43,899
Like, when I, you know, you
feel haunted by a game sometimes.

259
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:45,833
Like you're just at your
work or you're at school

260
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,933
and you think about the music
and you think about the world

261
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:51,233
and you're like, I really, that world
feels so real that you want to go back there.

262
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:53,299
That's the goal on it.

263
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,500
You know, that's the way you keep
people playing an adventure game.

264
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,533
Wolpaw: So anyway, did that help?

265
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,600
Is what I'm telling you helping at all?

266
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Schafer: Don't try to improve adventure games
because they're always bad.

267
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,799
Just make an old bad one.

268
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,100
Wolpaw: Yeah, make one
of your old bad ones.

269
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,399
Schafer: Ok, good. Well, thank
you Eric Wolpaw for coming.

270
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,533
And spreading your
special brand of love.

271
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:14,866
Wolpaw: Yeah, I mean, I'm just kidding.

272
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:17,799
I really do think the
adventure game you make

273
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:21,359
will be about as good
as the old ones you made.

274
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,827
[music]

275
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:40,433
Schafer: Oh, man. I love looking at this font.
It just makes me so happy. It takes me back.

276
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:43,366
We should do one of these games.

277
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:46,166
Point-and-click adventures are awesome.

278
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,333
Schafer: I repeat a lot,
I kind of recap sometimes,

279
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,566
like where I am so
far, like what I have.

280
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:54,399
Activities in one story 
affect the other, customizing.

281
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,033
This is a drawing that I hope will become
the title for the box, cover of the box.

282
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:02,700
Here's story boards
about the same intro.

283
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:09,000
I started writing some, no, I'm not
going to read you those names yet.

284
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:18,200
And there's a certain point you
just kind of instinctively know,

285
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,133
ok, now I need to talk to somebody.

286
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:21,899
Because you kind of feel like,

287
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,966
ok, this is as far as I can go right
now with what's in my head.

288
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,399
Schafer: So I was
thinking about this game.

289
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,799
And I had an idea.

290
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,966
Well, the first thing I did,
well, forget about it now.

291
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:35,000
Let me start over, ok.

292
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Gilbert: Would you like
to read your notes?

293
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,399
Schafer: And then you talk
to somebody who you feel,

294
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,433
ok, you're kind of taking a risk,

295
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:43,433
because you're exposing all your ideas
to somebody for the first time

296
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:46,866
and they might laugh at you.

297
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:52,600
Schafer: My idea for the story, the
story idea for this game is about two stories,

298
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,933
kind of happening side by side 
about a boy and a girl.

299
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:59,533
And they're in totally different
worlds and at different places.

300
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:02,433
Gilbert: Different realities or
just different places they go?

301
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:05,033
Schafer: Well, that's a good question.
That's an interesting question.

302
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:07,933
Gilbert: I'm jumping ahead.
Schafer: We don't know.

303
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,000
Schafer: Mostly I just get this relief
that I told somebody about the game

304
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,799
and they didn't tell me it was stupid.

305
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,333
But maybe they'll get inspired and
they'll say a whole bunch of other things.

306
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,799
Then you can take back into
the cave with you and like,

307
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:21,299
ah, now I have a whole bunch
of stuff to chew on and like,

308
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:24,133
ideas to bounce around
and more dots to play with.

309
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:26,399
It's hard to tell your ideas to people.

310
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,533
Schafer: That mostly sets it up, except
for my awesome story boards that I did.

311
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,299
That was the idea for the intro.

312
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:35,633
See, he's leaning, they're leaning against
that wall and he's in a spaceship.

313
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:37,700
And she's looking at a castle.

314
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,899
Gilbert: And then you just choose then,
one you want to start with?

315
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,933
Schafer: Yeah.

316
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:43,766
Schafer: The story so far, the
reason I'm excited about it is that

317
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:48,333
I've never done a story about this type,
like this age of character.

318
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,366
Like a coming of age story.

319
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:52,366
About a boy and a girl,
something about that

320
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:59,366
the pairing of those like equal stories
going on at the same time.

321
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:04,000
And the things I guess that are interesting
about that age to me are,

322
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,766
it's an age where you're learning to take
control and take some power in your life

323
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:13,733
and also the responsibility
that goes along with that.

324
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:17,366
You know, you're learning that
you have power in your life

325
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:20,766
and you're learning you have the
power to control your destiny.

326
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:25,133
You have the power to hurt people
and then kind of, you know,

327
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:28,733
becoming an adult or becoming a
young adult is about learning that

328
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:31,833
you can grab the wheel of your life
and steer it in a different direction.

329
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:35,533
I think that's, but then you take the
responsibility for what you've done.

330
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:38,666
And now no one's telling you,
you know, that you're going to be ok

331
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,033
if you go in this direction,
because you've chosen to do it.

332
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:43,533
Gilbert: I think it's
a really creative idea,

333
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:48,200
but I don't think it's the kind of thing
that we want to fund at this moment.

334
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,066
Schafer: That's great. That's so
funny because that's so crazy.

335
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:56,799
Schafer: No. I mean, in some
ways it's too early for feedback.

336
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,533
I mean, unless I'm totally am like,
stealing an idea from something,

337
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:04,466
because you can't say whether an idea
is good or not in some ways in the beginning,

338
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:09,966
because so much is about the execution 
or the specifics of like how, you know.

339
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:13,799
Because it's kind of, it's kind
of a vague pitch in a way.

340
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:18,366
It's like I want to do, I want to do
this game that's about two stories,

341
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:22,433
about a boy and a girl 
in really separate different worlds

342
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:25,599
who are navigating this
space in between them.

343
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,566
You know, like that could
mean a lot of different things.

344
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,299
That could be told many different ways.

345
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,633
So it's really hard for anyone to
say like, oh, that's a good idea.

346
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:36,000
But I mean, because I do
have, you do have some idea

347
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,333
of how you're going to do it
but you can't articulate all of it.

348
00:18:47,366 --> 00:18:50,200
Schafer: I'm ready for you.

349
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,166
It's like this, like this.

350
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,166
No, don't use that one!
Oh, god, it's going to be the one you use.

351
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,666
I was doing my Magnum face.

352
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,866
Dutton: I mean, I guess
people have put money down.

353
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:03,700
Some people have put
a lot of money down.

354
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,000
Are you feeling real pressure to make sure it's good?
Like more so than your other games?

355
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,033
Schafer: You know,
people always ask that

356
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:12,833
and I'm wondering what they thought
I was going to do before.

357
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,333
Dutton: Take it and run.

358
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,533
Schafer: I can't wait to
make this crappy game.

359
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:18,000
Schafer: I don't know.

360
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,633
I mean, I was scared about some things
that will happen on the project,

361
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:23,266
which is, did we already talk
about people being disappointed?

362
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:26,799
Well, once we talk about
what the game actually is,

363
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,933
we talk about this boy and this girl,

364
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:31,099
there's going to be some
people who are disappointed that

365
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:35,066
it's not about an armadillo or spider
or whatever they hoped it would be.

366
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:37,000
There's a game.

367
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,200
But it just collapsed from infinite possibility
into this one particular game.

368
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,933
The Internet: See, the Internet has
just given you a lot of money.

369
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,000
Over two million dollars.

370
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,066
Now, if it appeared that you
were wasting this money

371
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:56,000
to make an inferior product,
that would be very disappointing.

372
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,466
Schafer: I think people who think,
there're a lot of people

373
00:19:58,466 --> 00:20:01,033
who ask me, do you feel a lot
of pressure now, are you scared?

374
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,033
And I think they just don't
realize what I do all day,

375
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:07,033
'cause a lot of my day is like,
you know, in the past year,

376
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:08,533
it's been like, look
at the bank account.

377
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:11,333
There's no money in there.
I guess I'll fire everyone today.

378
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,966
You know what I mean?
That's, that's pressure. That's scary.

379
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:16,766
Like I'm sweating now
just thinking about that.

380
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:18,900
And I don't have to worry
about that for a long time.

381
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,666
And that's great.

382
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:25,799
But also, sitting around thinking about
what my hero should do until Act Three,

383
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,966
like that is the most easy,
pleasant part of my day.

384
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:32,266
You know, the time I spend locked
in my office in the morning writing is like,

385
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:35,766
I feel like I'm a kid again, 'cause this
is like, that's the easy part of my job.

386
00:20:35,766 --> 00:20:38,900
And you know, over the past
20 years I've built a company,

387
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,166
which puts a lot of
things added onto that.

388
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,700
Like thinking about business.
Thinking about HR.

389
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,466
Thinking about negotiating a deal with
a publisher and thinking about payroll

390
00:20:47,466 --> 00:20:49,900
and then thinking about team management

391
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,599
and who should be the next project leader
and what game should they work on.

392
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:55,133
And these two people
aren't getting along.

393
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:57,500
The building's going to turn
off our power on Thursday.

394
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,633
And there's all these things, like this
is what, like the totality of the company.

395
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:02,599
These are all things I think about.

396
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:05,166
And just me sitting in my office with
my notebook is like a little vacation.

397
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,633
Like, you know what, then a spaceship
could come down and yeah, it'd be great.

398
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:14,666
So I'm having a blast with that stuff.

399
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:20,166
[music]

400
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,000
Schafer: Maybe they're just
in it for the documentary.

401
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,533
I think a lot of people are.

402
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:58,099
And in the process,
I think people, you know,

403
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:02,933
want to see the creative process
and the story of us making the game.

404
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:05,466
There's a difference,
obviously, telling the story.

405
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:06,426
But who knows?

406
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:08,420
They'll get the game, they'll start it up
and they'll be like, oh, yeah!

407
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:10,933
I have to point-and-click
all this stuff? Ah!

408
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:12,766
And now I don't know what to do.

409
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:15,799
I have to think about
a solution to a, ugh.

410
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,599
But who cares?
We got their money, right?

411
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,879
Am I right, you guys?

412
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:26,506
Just kidding.

413
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:28,726
It's going to be awesome.                                                                                                                       
You're going to love it.
