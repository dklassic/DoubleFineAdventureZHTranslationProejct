1
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,328
Cambell: Hello?
Schafer: Hello!

2
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,796
Cambell: It's open.

3
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,015
Oh, god.

4
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:51,618
How many flights
of these stairs are there?

5
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,900
[Heavy breathing]

6
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,140
[Coughs]

7
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,780
[Gasping]

8
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,831
So out of shape.

9
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,234
Gonna die.

10
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:13,360
[Deep breaths]

11
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
[Knocking]

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,340
[Wheezing]

13
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,284
Cambell: Hi, dude.
Schafer: Hi.

14
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,886
Scott Campbell.
Cambell: You made it up the stairs.

15
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,188
Schafer: Do you wanna work
on our adventure game?

16
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,124
Cambell: Yes.
Schafer: Okay.

17
00:01:31,880 --> 00:02:01,960
[Music]

18
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,291
Schafer: Ah, you wanna come
to the stand up?

19
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,625
Crook: Come and do our stand up.
We're gonna have it right here.

20
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,060
Cambell: You guys stand up
for the whole thing?

21
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,395
Schafer: Come to our stand up.
Cambell: Okay.

22
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,628
I kind of have to use the...

23
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:10,796
you know...
Schafer: Nope.

24
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,165
Cambell: ...you-know-what first.
Schafer: Nope.

25
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,467
Oh yeah?

26
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,701
We were doing stand ups
when you were here.

27
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,136
Kipnis: Ah, Scott, holy shit.

28
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,038
Hey!
Cambell: Hey!

29
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:20,640
Kipnis: Hey!
Cambell: How are you?

30
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,376
Is this how you guys always do it,
just standing in the middle?

31
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:26,079
Schafer: You stand in the middle and 
then you close your eyes and you lean 
and we pass the body around.

32
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,382
Rice: Good, how's it goin'?
Cambell: Good, man.

33
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,617
Schafer: You know Brandon?
Dillon: No, we haven't met before.

34
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,754
Schafer: Brandon, Scott Campbell.
Cambell: Hey man.

35
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:36,056
Skillman: Oh man, we're being filmed.
Man, this is so awkward,

36
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:38,592
but it's nice to see you.

37
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,660
McGarry: Oh, it's on camera.
What's up, buddy?

38
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,062
Good to see you.

39
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,664
Hackett: That's all we do
around here is hug.

40
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,600
Cambell: Hey, buddy.
Hug sounds good, man.

41
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,335
Muir: I never met Peter Chan
in person.

42
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,470
McGarry: I never met him either.
Crook: Really?

43
00:02:50,860 --> 00:03:02,540
[Murmuring]

44
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:07,554
Schafer: Bap-bee-dee-bap-bup-ba-da,
buh-bum, ba-da-dum-dum-dum.

45
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,223
Ya-da-za-ha.

46
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,527
Let's see, are we all here?
Everyone here?

47
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,429
Hello, hello, everybody.

48
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,197
Hi, thanks for coming.

49
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,066
Uh, please join me in welcoming

50
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,600
some special guests
we have here today.

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,803
We have from--some out-of-towners.

52
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:26,740
We have Mr. Peter Chan
over here, Peter Chan.

53
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,308
Hello.

54
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,308
[applause]

55
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:34,147
Uh, we have Mr. Scott Campbell.
Where's Scott Campbell?

56
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,149
There's Scott Campbell!
Yay, Scott Campbell.

57
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
[Applause]

58
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,389
And we have, uh,
Nathan "Bagel" Stapley.

59
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,657
There he is.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,780
[Applause]

61
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,295
Anyone else coming in
from out of town?

62
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,796
Is anyone here? Great.

63
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:53,733
Um, we are doing, um, uh,
an art jam for Reds.

64
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,869
Reds is the code name
for our Double Fine Adventure.

65
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:58,872
This last week, we did one of my
favorite things, which was the art jam,

66
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,475
which we got all our artists
from across the country

67
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:04,044
here in this room
sitting around one table

68
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:08,048
just drawing and talking and
pitching ideas back and forth.

69
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,450
And we had Peter Chan

70
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,019
who has been working with me
since "Monkey Island 2."

71
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,423
We have Scott Campbell, who's here
since the beginning of Double Fine.

72
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,459
And Nathan "Bagel" Stapley,
who, um,

73
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,796
whose art is gonna be featured
front and center

74
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,998
in the Double Fine Adventure,

75
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,502
and who has also been here since
the beginning of Double Fine.

76
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,437
It's good to see you guys,
I haven't seen, you know,

77
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,573
a lot of you in the office for a while,
so it's awesome to have you here.

78
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:38,345
Um, people who don't know who
these guys are, ask somebody.

79
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,213
[Laughter]

80
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,749
Cambell: You know, I'm excited.
It's like a total reunion.

81
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:46,820
The last time we were all together
was, um, beginning of "Brütal Legend."

82
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,323
Peter was--Peter's been on, I think,
every one of his projects.

83
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:54,494
Chan: Here that, uh, hired me.
Right here.

84
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:58,064
Gilbert: I hired more people in
this industry than you know.

85
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,734
Chan: Tim and everyone was going,
"We would like you

86
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,203
to come back
and help us out on this."

87
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:07,374
And that was the friendliest
you've seen Ron right there, fellas.

88
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:11,378
To collaborate with, uh,
these guys Ron and Tim again

89
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:14,848
is, you know, is like the good old days,
you know?

90
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,117
So I didn't want
to pass that up.

91
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,085
Schafer: Art is obviously really
critical to graphic adventures.

92
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:23,690
It's part of the defining thing of like, "Let's have
an adventure game, but let's add not just text to it.

93
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,525
Let's actually show the world."

94
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,528
And seeing beautiful worlds
laid out in front of you

95
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,330
that inspire your imagination.

96
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,666
Your desire to explore them
is such an important thing,

97
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,069
'cause they don't have,
um, you know,

98
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,674
an RPG's progression drive,
you know, or an addictive hook

99
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,642
like collectables or
something like that usually.

100
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:47,180
It's just the--the thing that pulls you
forward and keeps you going is the--

101
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,018
the extent to which we've ignited
your desire to explore.

102
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,388
So I was gonna go over the state
of the game like storywise

103
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,824
and what design there
is on the game,

104
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,560
and then talk about, uh,
art jam, too, a little bit,

105
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,297
'cause this is a little-- this is a
little earlier than I think we did--

106
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,700
Like, when Peter--by the time
Peter visited on "Brütal,"

107
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,703
we already had a bunch of art
that we then kind of bundled up

108
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,338
and made the factions
and stuff like that.

109
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,273
This is, I think, a little
earlier in the process.

110
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,342
I was hoping to--
I asked Greg to kind of

111
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:20,747
get you guys here as soon as possible
to help generate ideas while I'm designing the game,

112
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,316
'cause, um, the game could go
so many different areas.

113
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,586
And I have this idea about the boy and the girl,
but, you know, there's the spaceship,

114
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,288
but there could be
anything on the spaceship,

115
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:31,992
and there's this pastoral world,
but it could be any level of--

116
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:36,296
it could have anything in it right now,
and I think a lot of these, I think coming up

117
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:40,233
with just visual ideas for cool places to go
are just as valid a place to start as anything.

118
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,737
Petty: This one is, we're at such
an early state on, uh, Reds,

119
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:48,875
that, um, you know, Tim--
Tim's only really identified

120
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,144
a few very specific things for us.

121
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,680
Schafer: Right now, the
green cards are characters--

122
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,181
these are the characters so far--

123
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,584
and the yellow cards
are just story points.

124
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,520
Um, I'm gonna be adding locations here

125
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,523
and, um, puzzles
in different colors.

126
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,525
I mean, I told them a lot
about what we have.

127
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:10,530
That's really as far as the game has gone
because, um, I've been doing a lot of business stuff,

128
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,299
which is annoying.

129
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:16,336
Yeah, so I'm way behind on the design and the
puzzles, but we did hire a business guy.

130
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:17,737
Rice: So that's good.

131
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,606
Schafer: Which means I won't have
to work on Hausen anymore.

132
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,375
But luckily,
we just hired a business guy

133
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,344
to come in and take care
of that stuff.

134
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,346
Trying to get Brad's
new project signed,

135
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,683
and, uh, there were a lot
of meetings at E3 and stuff.

136
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,552
Um, you know,
there's a few more details

137
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,789
that only make sense to me,
but, uh, um,

138
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,692
I mostly gave those guys
the heads up about where--

139
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,094
where everything is right now, yeah.

140
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,762
Uh, it's a story
about a boy and a girl,

141
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,031
and they both have two different
parallel stories going on,

142
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,434
and the player can jump back
and forth between them.

143
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,070
And the girl is,
um, a young girl

144
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,007
who's been chosen for this big honor
that she finds out is actually being sacrificed

145
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,476
to a horrible monster
in order to save her town.

146
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,379
And her story is about
choosing to break out

147
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,282
of that arrangement
and endanger her town

148
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,051
and hopefully fight the monster
and save her town.

149
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:10,156
And then the boy is a, um--
has grown up alone on a spaceship,

150
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,292
a giant,
kind of organic spaceship

151
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:15,662
that takes care of his every needs
and creates entertainment for him

152
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,597
and takes care of his food
and his health and everything,

153
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,733
but he's all by himself
out in space.

154
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:23,370
And it's about him
actually finding out, um,

155
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,804
how to take control of that ship

156
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,506
and get access to
new secret areas

157
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,577
and find out that he has
the ability to actually, uh,

158
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,111
have a higher purpose
than just hanging out

159
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,545
in this ship being entertained,

160
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,115
but he can actually
go on rescue missions

161
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,583
and save helpless creatures
around the galaxy.

162
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,284
Chan: Like all the other
adventure games,

163
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:44,056
I think he had more landmarks
already established.

164
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,092
More tent poles, right?

165
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:52,198
And, um, and then my job
was to connect between them.

166
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,834
And this time around,
yeah, there's less tent poles,

167
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:58,371
and so it's our job to go in
and try to figure out

168
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,673
what the other places
are right now.

169
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,643
Basically, all we're doing
is giving him

170
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:08,481
enough of inspiration for him
to run with it.

171
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:12,118
Once he sees an image
and his imagination starts,

172
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:15,288
you know, uh, walking around
in our drawings,

173
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,358
he can then start
to expand on that.

174
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,760
That's how it
always works with Tim.

175
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,862
Petty: On a creative
direction standpoint, you know,

176
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:26,466
Tim--I think Tim fishes a lot, you know?

177
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,369
And, um, he kind of
gets these elements

178
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,372
and then he makes unusual
but cohesive connections

179
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,007
between those elements,
you know?

180
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,509
And I think that this will help
that process for him.

181
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:40,013
Other people maybe have-- have in
mind a very specific mythology,

182
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,815
and I think Tim's different
in different games.

183
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:44,784
Like, I think "Brütal Legend,"
you know, he had a very, like,

184
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,187
"It's a roadie in this
heavy metal fantasy world,

185
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,855
and it's based on the look
of album covers,"

186
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:51,191
and Frazetta--some
of the very early stuff.

187
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:54,194
A little more--a little more
specific than some of this,

188
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:57,297
but I think in the end, he just
takes different ways to get there

189
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,065
depending on what he feels
the game needs

190
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,434
or what the theme of the game
is really about.

191
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,369
Schafer: But, um, it's still
in the phase where just,

192
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:07,040
like, everything is like, "Yes, and that
could be cool and this could be cool

193
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,143
and this could be cool," and just like,
coming up with tons of art.

194
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:14,614
That's my goal.
All right?

195
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,785
Petty: There's these big gaps
in the first two acts past the intro,

196
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,054
and that's where I think
we can help Tim the most.

197
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:29,640
[Music]

198
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:32,298
Schafer: It is--I'm joking,
but it is like a dream team.

199
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,368
I mean, these are the best artists I know,
and they're all here together.

200
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:47,420
[Music]

201
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,716
Cambell: Man, these
are a little dry, dude.

202
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,620
Chan: Who makes this?
Petty: Copic.

203
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,822
These are Japanese markers
and they're the best, because first,

204
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,590
they got a square shape so
they don't roll on your table.

205
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,660
Right, and they got nice--
nice medium-sized tip,

206
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,362
a very nice chisel tip.

207
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,730
And they--and they
really can lay it down,

208
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,667
so all you do to refill it is you
just pull this sucker off like that.

209
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,570
And you can buy just
tip replacements, too.

210
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,473
-Yeah.
-Oh yeah.

211
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:17,076
It's like, uh, I met some--
I met Chris.

212
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:20,246
Cambell: Like a steak--it's like a meat--
it's like a bacon steak root.

213
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,348
-Very nice.
-One down.

214
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,517
Bagel: Yam.
-Who else?

215
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,852
Chan: So she starts exploring.

216
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:30,657
When she reaches, like, pathways
which are made of twigs, all right?

217
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,625
Schafer: Mm-hm.
Chan: So there are some paths.

218
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,360
Once she's on it,
she won't sink anymore,

219
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,430
so that--that automatically
guides her through.

220
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,199
Schafer: Textural.
Chan: Now--awesome.

221
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,334
Petty: When he wasn't looking,
or when they needed to operate the ship,

222
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,803
they started to like fold back,
and they have all these like,

223
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,705
um, like A.M. clock radio innards,

224
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,774
and the arms come out
and they start doing stuff

225
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,076
and he turns around and they're
like back as a little bunny.

226
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,211
Cambell: So, like, these people
would be cruisin' around

227
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:56,215
on like combs and brushes, dude,
and they'd be combing the land like farming.

228
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,652
So it'd be like farming style, but
they'd be farming the trees and shit.

229
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,020
Schafer: Are they pulling out lice
to eat or anything?

230
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,555
Cambell: No, it'd just be really pretty.

231
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,992
That's the thing, they can be farming,
harvesting all the bugs and shit,

232
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,428
and then they could put it
in their little harvester,

233
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:11,297
but also making really
cool shapes from the stuff

234
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,466
that they create like that,
you know what I mean?

235
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,836
Chan: So, that's what we've got.

236
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,872
Bagel: Yeah, I think we're getting closer to--
I think we're just trying to figure out

237
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:24,177
like a language because-- since
these things are gonna be 2D painting,

238
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,678
I think we really
just have to figure out

239
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,281
the language of both worlds.

240
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,450
And I think we're like getting...

241
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,885
I think all these drawings,
once we put them all up tomorrow

242
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,721
and see what Tim says,

243
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:39,425
it'll even be just that next
level of direction, you know?

244
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,128
Cambell: But he just gets worried
when you throw away your drawings.

245
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:46,132
I don't know if you saw that today,
but we had some--some run-ins

246
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,267
with some of the artists
throwing away their work

247
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,470
'cause they don't think
it's good enough.

248
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,606
Schafer: Don't let me bother you,
I'm just looking at what you're drawing.

249
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,874
Those are pretty.

250
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:58,244
Where'd that squid go?
Bagel: Squid?

251
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,445
Petty: You were
painting a squid earlier.

252
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,780
Bagel: Oh yeah, I threw it out,
I threw it away.

253
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,181
Schafer: You threw it out?
Petty: Oh!

254
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,383
Schafer: You son of a--
Petty: We all liked it.

255
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,584
Cambell: Why'd you
throw that away, dude?

256
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,152
Bagel: Son of a monkey.
Which one?

257
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,322
Petty: Get a whole sheet.
Schafer: Oh my God, and you tore it in half?

258
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,491
Bagel: I can make another one.

259
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,759
Bagel: We'll make another one.

260
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,027
Cambell: Dude, that whole fuckin' page.

261
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,295
Bagel: You guys liked it?

262
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,196
Schafer: Yeah, we paid for that,
we paid for that.

263
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,399
You pretty much just stole from
the backers by tearing that up.

264
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,101
Bagel: Yeah.
Cambell: Why'd you rip that up?

265
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,836
-You crazy, man?
Bagel: I know.

266
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,805
Cambell: That was the best shit, man.

267
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,140
Bagel: Now, uh--

268
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,009
I didn't think
it was that great.

269
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:34,480
Yeah, he picked it out
of the trash, my drawing.

270
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,150
And then he told me
to do it over again.

271
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,484
Cambell: He'll probably Frankenstein
that one and that'll be the...

272
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,154
Bagel: Oh, speak of the devil.
Cambell: ...the biggest idea.

273
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,658
Schafer: You guys
talking about something?

274
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,193
That's cool.

275
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,462
Weird porcupine guys.

276
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,464
Bagel: It's like moving, uh, on land.
Schafer: That's awesome.

277
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,199
Chan: I have a lot of faith in Tim,

278
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,768
and all we have to do
is plant a few seeds

279
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,137
and he'll start running with it, right?

280
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,772
Cambell: Yeah, planting seeds.

281
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,675
Yeah, you don't know what seeds
will turn into rad stuff, man.

282
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:19,820
[Music]

283
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:24,664
Cambell: So it's just a list of possible room
ideas and experiences, you know?

284
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,200
Just kind of--like,
some of them are just words.

285
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,103
They may make us think about
some interesting things, you know?

286
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,405
Like wild jungle.
It's fun for people.

287
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,074
A sunny beach, candy room,

288
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:39,078
garden zone for, like,
the tender side of boys.

289
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
[Laughing]

290
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,817
Maybe those seeds
will grow into amazing things

291
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,554
and then we'll realize that those
amazing things are actually terrible.

292
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,458
So we'll just cover them up with a sheet
and then move on to the next thing.

293
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,293
Who knows?

294
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,129
You know, fireball, soccer,

295
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,598
playin' with fireballs are
really fun, probably, for boys.

296
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,033
Laser zone--anything
can be made into lasers,

297
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,735
so you can eat sandwiches of lasers,

298
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,272
you could just shoot 'em,
ride 'em, dodge 'em. You know.

299
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,142
I'll just do drawings
and try to get people pumped.

300
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,444
It's my--That'll be my role.

301
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,746
So this is like, just,
could be waterfalls

302
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,282
and different things of goop,
and it could be falling down,

303
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,884
or this could be barf, you know?

304
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:20,720
And it could be like animal,
or, you know, creatures

305
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,256
made of barf kind of unhappy
or happy, you know?

306
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,224
Like, and they can be
barfing new creatures.

307
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:28,194
It could just be barf zone,
you know what I mean?

308
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:31,030
Schafer: Was there a period in your life
where you had a barf thing?

309
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,465
Cambell: People love barf, dude.

310
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,567
Schafer: Oh, no, they don't.

311
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,703
Cambell: At this point, everything
is disposable and stuff, so.

312
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,472
That's the thing
about creative processes, like,

313
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:43,876
you wanna go down
every road fully

314
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,511
to realize that road is wrong.

315
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,281
You can't just go down a
little bit and be, "Ooh, uh..."

316
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,750
You gotta really
test that water fully

317
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,618
before you can realize
that's a terrible road.

318
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,421
And then you go down
the next road.

319
00:15:55,421 --> 00:16:01,394
Rice: This is a list of locations
from our backers on the forums.

320
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:04,063
Petty: You know, some of the stuff,
we're just incorporating backer--

321
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,032
uh, backer ideas,
which was cool.

322
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:07,867
You know, but they don't really know
anything about the story,

323
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,335
which is kind of
cool at this phase, right,

324
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,237
that they don't really have to,
that maybe some of those things

325
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,339
will wind up working in ways.

326
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,374
Rice: I went through
the first ten pages so far.

327
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,676
Schafer: Oh my God,
how many pages are there?

328
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,878
Rice: I know, there's 38
or something like that.

329
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,346
Um, we're still in girl world.

330
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,014
Sand castle world?

331
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,115
That's a new one.
Bagel: Sand castles.

332
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,617
Rice: Sand castle world.

333
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,118
Boy world.

334
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:29,388
A haunted lighthouse
on the moon.

335
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,090
Schafer: What?
Bagel: I didn't see that moon comin'.

336
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,393
Rice: Um, this dude says,
"Inside of a computer."

337
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,530
This dude says, "An entire city
made of blanket forts."

338
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,832
That was something.
Cambell: Yeah.

339
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:44,070
Rice: MS-DOS world, where
everything's made from words.

340
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,172
Schafer: That's a text adventure,
that's called a text adventure.

341
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:51,077
Rice: "It is a place where you play
connect-the-dots to build the location."

342
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,645
Cambell: Fuckin' creative people, dude.

343
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,180
Rice: Yeah.
Cambell: It's okay if we use that shit?

344
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,581
I mean, dude, we're gonna get...

345
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,517
Schafer: Yeah.
Cambell: ...sued.

346
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,320
Seriously, man, fuck, like, I'm
so excited to see these lists.

347
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,991
I feel like--I feel like
it's cheating, kind of.

348
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:07,792
Bagel: It's like, uh, they're stoked.

349
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:11,162
Like, if somebody gets their idea made,
like, that'd be awesome.

350
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:14,733
Cambell: And there's all these sequels based
on that one idea that someone said,

351
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:20,238
then they're gonna start being like, "Hm,
maybe I should have held onto that idea."

352
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,407
Schafer: The hair trees,
wanna mention that.

353
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:25,343
I love all these guys and that
whole story, like, whatever--

354
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,346
I don't even know
what it is yet, but like,

355
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,250
the idea of going into this, like, grass-covered
thing that comes to life.

356
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,286
And this behavior is
really cool, it's just like,

357
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,621
there's something
lazy about it that I like.

358
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,623
Cambell: We've just been trying to get
as much stuff as we can.

359
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:41,594
All right, with the big--I just think it's
a round hunchback of forest right here.

360
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:44,230
Schafer: It's kind of like those, uh, you know,
those places in New Mexico or...

361
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,300
Cambell: We're not getting too into the
mechanics of how the ship creates things

362
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,436
or how the monster land looks
or how the city looks,

363
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:55,841
but just kind of overall things
that might spark stuff for him right now.

364
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,843
So we'll just do more
of that tomorrow.

365
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:24,080
[Music]

366
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,141
Chan: I just, uh, did a lot
of drawing on my own,

367
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,010
you know, self-taught.

368
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,614
I would draw--when I was little,
I would draw on paper,

369
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,016
and then,
if I didn't like something,

370
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,185
I would crumple it up
and throw it away.

371
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:44,690
And I remember my father
said to me, um, "Now, if you--

372
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,461
if you just slide your drawings
into the garbage can,

373
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,097
and without crumpling it--
without crumpling it up,

374
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:54,467
you would fit more drawings
in the, um, garbage bin,"

375
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:58,371
not knowing that he was
going through it later, um,

376
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:03,075
and pulling out the ones he liked,
because, um, after he passed away,

377
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,879
I found a folder
that was labeled, uh, "Peter,"

378
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,548
and I found my old
Star Wars drawings.

379
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:13,119
Uh, if he didn't do that,
I wouldn't have any drawings,

380
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:18,157
because I don't--
I don't really keep my--my stuff around.

381
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:31,100
[Music]

382
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:35,274
As you can see, uh,
I tucked in the woods here,

383
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:40,880
and this is where I get
my inspiration, is, uh, nature.

384
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,819
Um, so, as you know, uh,
you're on San Juan Island,

385
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:50,656
and, uh, this is my little studio
away from my home,

386
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:55,995
and this is where I create, uh,
drawings for games and films.

387
00:19:55,995 --> 00:20:00,166
I'm, uh, in here
eight hours a day,

388
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,702
and what's nice is on
a beautiful day like today,

389
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:07,440
I--I, uh, I like to draw
outside when I can.

390
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,208
When I'm having
a creative block,

391
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,611
that's the time to go out,
you know, go on walks and hikes,

392
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:16,415
and that's important
to be creative, too.

393
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:20,886
I need to create that space
to think.

394
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,855
I love it, can't go back.

395
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:29,395
This fits and feels really,
really good for my creative self

396
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:34,366
and for my emotional self
and everything else.

397
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,801
It's really good.

398
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,504
"Grim" actually
was my last adventure game,

399
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:42,408
and it was the--
and it was done here on the island.

400
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:47,279
It was my first job
away from Lucas.

401
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:55,287
This was my goin' away present,
uh, from Lucas, as you can see.

402
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,124
Never forget where you started,
where you come from,

403
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,659
and that's something
really important to me.

404
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:05,264
'Cause that's why, um, I have, like,
some Star Wars stuff in here.

405
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,200
It's important that I have
a few of those things around

406
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,136
because that's what inspired me.

407
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:11,670
That's what got me started.

408
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,641
That's why this piece here,
by Ralph McQuarrie,

409
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,877
is so important to me,

410
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:21,113
'Cause he's the man that, um,

411
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,750
inspired me to do
what I'm doing now.

412
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,621
When I was ten, I didn't know
that there was such thing as,

413
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,122
a, you know, concept designer,

414
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,324
someone that actually
designs something

415
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,461
for you to live in
for those couple hours,

416
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:40,332
if it was a movie, or--or now,
hours playing video games.

417
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:45,037
I mean, it's a--an opportunity to escape
and live in that world.

418
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,139
This is where I draw, mostly.

419
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,508
I do everything standing up,

420
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:53,212
and I still draw on paper,
as you can see.

421
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:58,284
Down here is, uh,
all the bad ideas right here.

422
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:01,020
See, these are the workups.

423
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,124
From this came this one,
where it's--

424
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:10,196
as you can see, is a total mess,
and, uh, I try to come up with, uh, some funny ideas,

425
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:13,432
and then from there,
becomes this one up here.

426
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:17,736
And then eventually, I use
all those drawings, um,

427
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,773
to start my fire in the morning.

428
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,212
It's a good lesson
on letting go.

429
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:35,340
[Music]

430
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,490
I'm gonna show you guys something.

431
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,864
These are my family photo albums

432
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:49,235
of when Tim and Pete Tscale
came to visit,

433
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:55,040
and, uh, used to do work jams
on the island with me

434
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,110
at the, uh, farmhouse.

435
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:02,848
That's, uh, me in my
upstairs loft studio out of--

436
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,416
in the farmhouse.

437
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:09,255
And those are all the storyboards
for "Grim Fandango."

438
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:11,257
And here's me drawing.

439
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:14,193
I don't remember, but Tim swears
that I was drawing so fast

440
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:18,330
I was shooting
the little ball tips out.

441
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:22,134
Is he gonna kill me?
I gotta show you this.

442
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,869
I'm not gonna show you
the second one,

443
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,038
'cause I know he'll kill me
for sure,

444
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:30,542
but I'm gonna give you this one
because he looks so good in it.

445
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,412
Tim chopping wood.

446
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,183
And I'm not gonna show you
the second one.

447
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:42,988
That's a before,
and then this one's after.

448
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,794
"Grim" is my favorite,
um, adventure game

449
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,729
that I've ever worked on.

450
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:55,267
But who knows, this could be
the next favorite game.

451
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:59,838
When I start a project,
I start collecting my books.

452
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,641
It's important to go
and do your research,

453
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,544
do it the old-fashioned way first.

454
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:10,382
And I learn more by going to
the library and reading up on it

455
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:14,186
instead of just looking
for a pretty picture off the internet.

456
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,855
And so for us to create
our own village,

457
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:20,059
I think it's important
that we, um,

458
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,094
try to find that happy balance

459
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:26,165
between what we're familiar
with as fairytale--

460
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,400
the signature shape
is, like, mushrooms,

461
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,502
for, like, Alice in Wonderland--

462
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,604
and you balance it
with something foreign,

463
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,074
something that
we're not familiar with.

464
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:37,242
In Japanese architecture,
you can kind of see

465
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,813
there's mushrooms in it
without even thinking about it.

466
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:44,316
There are these great mushroom shapes
that are happening,

467
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,586
and so I thought
I'd mix that up with,

468
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:51,824
um, Scandinavian,
like country homes,

469
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:55,294
and that brings in some
of the really cute stuff

470
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:58,464
that's happening, see,
with the thatched roofing.

471
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:01,100
Here you can kind of see
that my wood-burning stove

472
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,002
that I put
in the background here

473
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:08,741
looks like
one of these lanterns.

474
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:12,144
It has, like, the mushroom top.

475
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:15,614
And so, I'm just figuring
that out right now,

476
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:21,820
and then eventually have to pitch this
to, um, Tim and Lee,

477
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,658
and hopefully sell them
the ideas that I have.

478
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:31,063
Um, yeah, I can't wait.

479
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:34,666
And then what's nice, though,
is that I'm able to shut that door

480
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:38,137
at the end of the day and walk
across the lawn and go home,

481
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:42,674
and I leave, uh,
this game in the studio

482
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,611
and it doesn't follow me--
follow me home,

483
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:51,316
because my life at home
is important.

484
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:54,586
And, uh, and actually, you know,
we should get out of here

485
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:57,156
and spend some time outside.

486
00:25:57,156 --> 00:26:00,492
That's where some
of the better ideas come from.

487

Cambell: My name's Scott Campbell and
I live here in New York City.

489
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:34,593
We are in my apartment,
which also is my studio.

490
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:38,764
I'm an illustrator
and I've worked at Double Fine, uh--

491
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:42,868
I think I was employee
number six in 2001,

492
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:45,270
and I was art director
on "Psychonauts"

493
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,206
and "Brütal Legend."

494
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:50,442
Production designer for "Brütal Legend,"
my official title.

495
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,744
When I was working
at the studio, like,

496
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:56,315
I liked to go into his office
and just kind of show him,

497
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:59,017
like, uh, the paintings
and drawings and stuff,

498
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,620
and I would be able
to gauge from his--

499
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,388
his reaction
whether or not it was good.

500
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,858
That's what I miss
living here in New York.

501
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:08,327
One thing I know
that Tim likes, though--

502
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:12,197
he likes drawings
when they're in cool poses.

503
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:15,767
Even if the designs aren't
very good, he just likes poses.

504
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,836
So if there's a dude that
I really like the design of,

505
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:21,273
I'll put him in the coolest pose
and hope that he digs it.

506
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:24,476
It was one of my
favorite poses is putting his--

507
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,245
putting your feet up
on something.

508
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:30,082
Always sell Tim on this pose.

509
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:32,084
I haven't talked to Tim
since the very beginning,

510
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,019
so I don't know how
it's evolved, you know?

511
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,622
Just when Tim first pitched
the game to Bagel and I,

512
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:38,190
he came here to New York.

513
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,826
We had some, uh,
some sangria and some tacos

514
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,195
and we talked about it
and he gave us the pitch.

515
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:46,164
And so after that,
you know, Bagel--Bagel and I

516
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,267
just kind of started
just gathering our friends

517
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:51,169
and just trying out drawing
the main two characters

518
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,172
and some basic
environment ideas.

519
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,706
Pre-production is like
when you get started

520
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:57,276
and you start dream--
dream the dreams, you know?

521
00:27:57,276 --> 00:28:01,046
It can be anything you want and stuff,
and you're just kind of gathering inspiration.

522
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:04,683
Gathering reference is like--
it's like my favorite part,

523
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,718
so I'm constantly taking
stuff from the internet,

524
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,554
like gathering images and stuff.

525
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:10,989
It's just like if ever I hit--
if ever I see something cool,

526
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,825
I'll just kind of take it
and put it in a folder for later.

527
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,694
Just like kind of the effects
or the colors,

528
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,697
I don't know what it would inspire,
but it just makes me feel pretty good.

529
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,166
I just think
that's an odd scene.

530
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:25,270
This is a nice soft picture of a lady
that makes me feel pretty good.

531
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,039
I don't know what these
are gonna inspire at all, you guys.

532
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,541
I--I do all the drawings
like kind of this

533
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,476
just on pieces of paper
like this.

534
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:35,414
I just draw on Xerox paper
and stuff, and I, like,

535
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,015
I just scan 'em in
and kind of make 'em

536
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,384
look better later,
pretty much, so.

537
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,020
It's easy for me to kind of
like chill out in the morning

538
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,122
in a café and do drawings like that,

539
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:47,259
and then kind of like
worry about, you know,

540
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,461
just so I could kind of--
any way that I kind of relax

541
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,230
and kind of loosen up
and stuff like that,

542
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,133
and I find that if I'm not near
a computer, I'm most relaxed.

543
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,235
This is my little drawing zone.

544
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,539
See, I print out a lot of my--
a lot of my reference

545
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,441
and kind of mood boards.

546
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:05,644
So I have this up and I'm
constantly kind of changing it out.

547
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:09,147
You know, update it, and with new things,
make me feel different ways, so.

548
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,782
So here are some paintings.

549
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:14,286
So I painted these girls from--
these are from the game,

550
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:17,322
and so I just print out--
print them out,

551
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,625
and then just kind of trace 'em
onto the paper,

552
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:23,195
and then start--start
water coloring like that.

553
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,663
This could be the girl,
you guys.

554
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:28,433
This could be the--
this could be the--the drawing.

555
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,236
So let's see what
happens together, shall we?

556
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,138
I'm gonna give her
this little dress here.

557
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,374
I'm not exactly sure
what that's made of.

558
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:38,343
Noodle arms. Well, it doesn't
really look like noodle arms.

559
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,178
Okay, there she is.

560
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,314
That's one version.

561
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:45,284
Maybe she has a little buddy,
her magical buddy.

562
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,219
We'll see.
There you go.

563
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,087
This is, uh, concept art.

564
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:54,059
That's--that's how it works.

565
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,528
That's how magic works.

566
00:29:56,528 --> 00:30:02,134
Oh, here's a painting that Bagel did
of Obama a long time ago.

567
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,669
Bagel and I
are really tight bros.

568
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:06,471
I moved here,
um, about four years ago,

569
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,607
and he moved here
like a month after.

570
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:11,843
He stayed with our other friend,
and then he would just work out of my house

571
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,212
'cause we were still workin'
for Double Fine out of my house.

572
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:17,449
And then he just was always over here,
so he just found a place over here.

573
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,017
Yeah, he's super close.

574
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,453
I mean, we can just
walk there right now even.

575
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:24,322
[Offscreen] Okay, and
then we cut to us over there.

576
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,524
Okay, cool.

577
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,798
Cambell: That's his window up there.

578
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:35,100
Bagel!

579
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,237
Hey, bro.
Bagel: Hey, buddy!

580
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,373
It's a little tight,
sorry, guys.

581
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:45,077
I was gonna try to clean
all this stuff up, but I didn't.

582
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:46,344
Cambell: That's okay, man.

583
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,147
Bagel: This is my bedroom here

584
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:52,784
and my studio where I paint
and where I sleep.

585
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,487
There's my bed,
there's my bathroom.

586
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,255
It's pretty amazing.

587
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,057
Um, it's clean.

588
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,827
And this is my kitchen.

589
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:05,230
This is my view, the projects.

590
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,165
And this is like
this butcher paper that I had

591
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,367
that I imagined I was gonna,
like, draw all over,

592
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,269
but that's about as far
as I've gotten.

593
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:14,606
But if I ever want to draw
on the wall, I could do it.

594
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,509
Painting, I do it--I usually
just stick a canvas on the wall.

595
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,044
You could see, like,
all these paint marks

596
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:22,314
like underneath that map.

597
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:25,984
I just like tack up a canvas on the wall
and start paintin' on it, usually.

598
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,652
Yeah, no easel.

599
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,088
So I'm just in the
sketching phase kind of now,

600
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:33,225
and I do that all right here
on the computer.

601
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,994
I have, like, one show a year
that's kind of like my sketch.

602
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:39,397
I just work--do work stuff
and then have, like, a solo show.

603
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,800
That's the--how it's been goin'
the last, like, three years,

604
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,603
so I just have like one big show
to worry about a year.

605
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:47,739
Some stuff I had in the show last year.

606
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:52,077
18 Dads, it's a bunch of dads.

607
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,545
This is just random pieces of paper.

608
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:56,448
This is like how I
organize myself, I guess.

609
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:59,651
These are just studies,
like color studies, like N.C. Wyeth

610
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,187
and, uh, that's the
illustrator that I like.

611
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:03,655
Just weird doodles.

612
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:08,293
First kind of color sketch
of that thing, yeah.

613
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:11,263
Tim hadn't even really talked
about the idea that he had yet.

614
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,732
I would just kind of throw
things at him every week,

615
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:15,767
and sometimes he would say
that he liked little things

616
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,769
or he would just grab
onto something

617
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,371
and then I would take it,
or, you know,

618
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:22,441
just kind of push things
or try other things out.

619
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,510
And so, um, I worked out
this kind of story

620
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,046
about this weird lumberjack
and a bear.

621
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:32,584
Like he washes up
on this mysterious island,

622
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,120
and it's like a magical island
in some huge lake

623
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,555
in the Pacific Northwest.

624
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:39,825
This is kind of where
the prototype started.

625
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:42,127
Yeah, I had an idea
that this, like, caveman

626
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,429
got unfrozen with this dinosaur
and they ended up, like,

627
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,498
in the--what was it,
like, Virginia?

628
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,333
The mountains of Virginia
and stuff?

629
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:53,805
And it--it was gonna be all like,
uh, bluegrass soundtrack,

630
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,007
fish-out-of-water style,
and then they would, like,

631
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,676
all play music together
or something,

632
00:32:57,676 --> 00:33:00,479
but I don't think
that's gonna happen.

633
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:04,115
This is where that
lumberjack dude is right now.

634
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,617
He's gonna be a puppet,

635
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:09,254
so we're, like,
separating all of his limbs.

636
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:10,722
I gotta cut him all up.

637
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:15,026
You know, break him up into kind of joints,
but really simple puppet-style, so, you know,

638
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:18,430
at the knees, at the elbows,
and puppetize him

639
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,632
for Ray to start
animating this week.

640
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:22,801
You know, in between
these rotating poses,

641
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:24,769
he can, you know,
supposedly make him look

642
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,671
like he's going back and forth.

643
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,175
So I gotta like paint
what's gonna be behind the arms,

644
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:33,645
but he's gonna move it around,
so you gotta see what's behind here.

645
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:36,715
Uh, this game is gonna be
so totally different and new,

646
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:39,217
so who knows, you know?

647
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:41,386
It's gonna be exciting
when we start getting into like,

648
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,788
uh, the real deal.

649
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,324
I'm lookin' forward to that,
it's gonna be awesome.

650
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,093
Schafer: I've always loved
Bagel's paintings.

651
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:50,529
He's, um, when he does his
fine art shows and galleries,

652
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:55,133
he does these crazy works
that are somewhat surreal,

653
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:59,771
you know, playing with scale
and playing with a mix of cartoony and, like, realism.

654
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,774
He can do realistic stuff really well,
mixes it with cartoony stuff

655
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,709
and otherworldly type landscapes,

656
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:08,480
and I think--I wanna do a whole game
that'll look like those landscapes

657
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,447
and with those strange characters.

658
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:12,149
Bagel: Check it out.

659
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,286
Franzke: It takes a while to actually
be responsive, for some reason.

660
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,121
Bagel: No way!

661
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,290
Man, that looks so cool on the iPad.

662
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,456
Rice: Isn't that awesome?

663
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:21,225
Schafer: Did you see that?

664
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,194
Bagel: Is it like a touch and then
he walks toward your finger?

665
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,462
Rice: Just touch down.

666
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,464
You have to be
in the foreground.

667
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,766
Schafer: We can't go in the back
with all the layers yet?

668
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,701
Oliver: Not right now, not this version.

669
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:31,303
Rice: But you can walk around.

670
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,637
Bagel: It's insane.

671
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:38,176
Schafer: It makes me so happy
'cause it's on an iPad and it looks pretty.

672
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:41,780
In the end, all the art will go through Nathan,
as he paints the final stuff.

673
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:45,283
So it's all gonna look like his style,
so it'll all be unified.

674
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:50,188
You're just gonna see his take
on the other artists' ideas and drawings.

675
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,389
This'll be more than any
game we've done before,

676
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:54,491
like, uh, in the end, you know,

677
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:57,027
a game where Bagel
really gets to shine.

678
00:34:57,027 --> 00:35:00,365
Bagel: Yeah, I mean, I guess, I mean, and
theoretically, he should be darker, like, you know?

679
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:02,200
I think he's too light right now.

680
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,304
Like, he should blend--the colors, I think,
should blend more with the environment.

681
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:09,641
But, um, that's--that--
it's just not in yet.

682
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,343
It's, uh...

683
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:13,345
Lee's gonna do some
effects and aftereffects,

684
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:16,681
I think, that lights
the character's texture,

685
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,317
so he would be a lot more blue
and dark in this one.

686
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,054
Nice.

687
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,192
Killer.

688
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:31,329
I feel pretty awesome
about it, I think.

689
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,098
I feel great about everything.

690
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:35,633
Uh, yeah, I think--it's--I'm,
like, interested to see

691
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,036
how it's gonna go, you know?

692
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:41,373
Like I hope those guys don't
hate my paintings of their paintings.

693
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:44,342
You know, it's awesome
'cause they're just gonna be

694
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,610
in a sweet painting world.

695
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,380
Like, that's--
that gets me pumped

696
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,317
that people are gonna be able to, like,
explore my paintings, you know?

697
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,689
Rice: That's hilarious.

698
00:35:57,689 --> 00:36:02,394
Bagel: That's amazing, though, dude.
Rice: Oh, man, that's super good.

699
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:07,399
Crook: So I'm actually scaling the arms a little bit
so that it feels like they go--

700
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:08,466
Yeah, they get a little bit
of perspective.

701
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:09,801
And the feet.
Rice: Yeah.

702
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:13,104
Bagel: That totally, uh,
that totally works.

703
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:16,408
Petty: It's weird, it's a hybrid process
'cause it's like you're doing a 2D painting,

704
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:18,143
but then we do have to get it
on a 3D geometry,

705
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:19,878
so it has some
of the cleanup work

706
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,747
as if it were a real 3D--
like a full 3D model.

707
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:27,419
Bagel: It depends on how complicated we're gonna get
with all the parallaxing and, you know,

708
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:29,821
I have never had to
worry about memory issues

709
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:34,726
in painting and restrictions, you know,

710
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:38,463
technical restrictions or
anything like that, so, yeah,

711
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:40,598
I mean, it's really, like, gonna
be a crazy learning process

712
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,667
at the same time, you know?

713
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:47,439
Yeah, putting it all together and makin' it
into a working, functional, moving world is, like,

714
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:52,310
I haven't really done that before,
so this is a whole--a whole new world.

715
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:56,848
If I were to say, like, "Ah, here's this--
here's, like, him the most lit he's gonna be."

716
00:36:56,848 --> 00:37:00,151
Uh, you know, "Here's
him dark as he's gonna be,"

717
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,719
and then, like, you're--okay--

718
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,354
Petty: But I think it solves
a different problem, right?

719
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:07,792
We're talking about-- like, I think the general
color gradients, I think, look good.

720
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,994
I think the rim lighting
is a different thing.

721
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,497
That's not about lighting
as much as it is, like,

722
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:14,999
when there's an intense
light source around.

723
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,570
It's about just putting a little bit on there
to, like, tie him into the scene.

724
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,740
I think, I mean, you read the comments at the forum,
and like everyone found it very appealing.

725
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,409
It really helped the tie-in.
Bagel: Yeah?

726
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,312
Schafer: Yeah, Bagel is not, um,
really, you know, technical.

727
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,013
He likes to paint.

728
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:34,486
He likes to paint on, you know,
canvas and paper, and, uh, um,

729
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:40,058
and that's why it's really invaluable to have someone
like Lee Petty on the team who can bridge that gap.

730
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:42,427
He's a fine artist himself,
he can draw, he can paint,

731
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:46,498
but he also knows how to use,
um, incredibly advanced,

732
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:49,000
you know, techniques
and 3D rendering, and, you know,

733
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,137
just making games that, you know,
a lot of programmers, you know,

734
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:56,508
he can match programmers sometimes
with the knowledge of, um...

735
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,443
He's got a lot of knowledge.
That's what I'm trying to say.

736
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:01,513
So it's great to have someone like Lee
around who can bridge that gap.

737
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:03,348
Petty: That's why I was saying earlier,
don't paint the character dark

738
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:05,049
because you can never get lighter.

739
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:08,119
We want to generally paint him pretty light
like this 'cause then he can get darker.

740
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,221
Schafer: If you can span
both worlds, it's really essential,

741
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:14,826
'cause you can work with a great artist,
but then if that doesn't really translate into the game,

742
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:18,830
you can be, um,
it's just a waste.

743
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:22,200
Chan: Yeah, I'm--I'm curious
as much as you are,

744
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,636
and I have faith
that it'll work.

745
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:28,173
I mean, Tim--see, that's
the thing is like, Tim says,

746
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:33,077
"This is what I--I want to
showcase Bagel's style."

747
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:36,347
Perfect.
I think that's a great idea.

748
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,317
And so I trust him.

749
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,720
If that's what he wants, then--
then there's something there.

750
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,024
Bagel: Ooh!

751
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:47,392
Petty: All right, Ray.
Crook: Go back to your jam.

752
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:48,827
Petty: All right.
Bagel: Jam out.

753
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,028
Crook: All right, guys.

754
00:38:50,580 --> 00:39:37,480
[Music]

755
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:40,011
Schafer: You know, very early on,
I sometimes have

756
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,614
these stress nightmares
about the game not existing yet.

757
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:44,449
I used to have
these nightmares about levels

758
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:49,420
in "Psychonauts" that didn't exist yet,
and like, I was floating in the undesigned world

759
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,855
and couldn't grab
onto anything.

760
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:54,125
It's just like,
it's the stress of things

761
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,227
that you haven't
really pulled together yet.

762
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,429
And these are like little
life preservers and the--

763
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,164
floating in the ocean,
like, you grab onto them like,

764
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,567
"Ah, ah, now I can breathe
and, like, look around

765
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:07,105
and see what else I can pull together
to make a raft out of," you know?

766
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,139
That's a metaphor.

767
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,608
I like how it's like lighthouse
with the haunted house on top of it.

768
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,310
Petty: Yeah, it's basic--

769
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,645
Chan: I can go home now?
Schafer: What?

770
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,146
Petty: Peter Chan.
Bagel: Thank you.

771
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,016
Schafer: Peter Chan, yeah, Peter Chan.

772
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,451
Oh, Bagel's posting!
Bagel, Bagel.

773
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,487
Chan: Bagel!

774
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:23,621
Bagel: Yeah.
Chan: Yeah.

775
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:24,789
Bagel: Jump in there.

776
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,525
Schafer: Bagel.

777
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,427
Okay.
Bagel: Floating island maybe that--

778
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,561
Schafer: What's on the floating island?

779
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,330
What are all these guys
jumping off?

780
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,866
Penguins?
Bagel: Maybe they're loomin' outside the bushes.

781
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,135
Cambell: You should scan those in.
Schafer: Crazy imagination.

782
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:39,037
Bagel: Yep, crazy imagination.

783
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:42,240
Schafer: Bradbury early folklore--
Mars folklore.

784
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,609
Ooh, I like Mars folklore.
Bagel: Mars folklore.

785
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,544
Yeah, okay, bros,
I'm out of here.

786
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:47,645
Schafer: Aw!

787
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,148
Cambell: What?

788
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:52,083
Schafer: Aw, why?

789
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,285
Thank you for comin'.
Cambell: See you, buddy.

790
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,687
Bagel: All right.

791
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:56,988
Bye, bros.

792
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:59,691
-All right, buddies.
[Offscreen] Bye, Bagel!

793
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:02,493
Chan: Well, I came over
to say goodbye.

794
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,462
Schafer: Next time, we come up to you.

795
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,165
Chan: Yeah.
Schafer: It's gonna be awesome.

796
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:08,766
Oh, Jesus.

797
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,803
Chan: I know.

798
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,803
[Laughter]

799
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:23,480
[Music]

800
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,551
Schafer: These are just some, uh, see,

801
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:30,021
Scott is doing some
crazy people, which I like.

802
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:33,825
And Lee did some crazy monsters,
which I love those, too.

803
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,526
This guy's too young,
that's wrong.

804
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:36,761
I love that one.

805
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:38,663
Those are freaking me out.

806
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,199
Um, I don't know what that is.

807
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,202
The Jedi robe.

808
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:45,403
I don't know
about the Jedi robe.

809
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:46,671
Some monsters.

810
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,339
That is a really scary monster.

811
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:52,777
I think his little--ugh--
little things up front.

812
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:55,012
And Bagel did this one

813
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:59,550
and it's like a mountain
that looks like a wig.

814
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,352
It's like wig mountain.

815
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,154
And that's like a ship, I think.

816
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,989
And these are waves floating.

817
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,258
Little mushroom guy,
which I love.

818
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,426
I love these paintings.

819
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,361
They're so tiny.

820
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,196
Sacrificial altars.

821
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,499
Here's another vision
of the girl's village,

822
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:17,435
really happy and
cheerful looking, which I like.

823
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:19,203
This is crazy.

824
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:24,575
It's like a, um...
I don't know what that is.

825
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,411
God's eye,
we just had that idea today.

826
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,279
That one's gonna work, I think.

827
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:29,847
This is such a great stage
in the project

828
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,549
'cause everything's been,
like, in my head

829
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,418
and the people's heads
and in my notebook,

830
00:42:33,418 --> 00:42:38,356
and now it's just exploded out
on the wall for everyone to see.

831
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:39,757
Everyone.

832
00:42:40,080 --> 00:43:17,580
