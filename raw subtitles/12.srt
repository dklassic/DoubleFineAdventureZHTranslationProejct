1
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,992
Brown: Good, a little more slowly.

2
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:26,293
Technician: And, 115.

3
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,731
Kaufman: Not quite.

4
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:33,400
We won't activate
the Omicron Inhibitor

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,869
until we're ready to take
the shields down.

6
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,237
Brown: Mm!

7
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,705
Yes.

8
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,240
Sorry.

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,509
I'm steppin' on you,
but: Wow. Yum.

10
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,245
Schafer: "Wow. Yum."

11
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,580
Brown: Dude, I love when--

12
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,549
When they get it right,
it's like, fuck.

13
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,150
Schafer: I want to eat your voice
when you poop it out.

14
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,451
Brown: It's the best.

15
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,253
Just fucking poopin'
in my mouth.

16
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,055
I'm saying that just for you.

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:19,080
[Music]

18
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,417
McConnel: Um...

19
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,719
I just really like to...
to be here

20
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:29,589
whenever I can make it
up the...hill.

21
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,159
It is a little reminiscent
of the field that the girl

22
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,794
starts out in, now, isn't it?

23
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:38,765
When I did that theme,
um...we hadn't moved yet.

24
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,369
Uh, so I sorta had
to imagine that field

25
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:45,639
and work to the picture, um...

26
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:49,876
But you know, uh...

27
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,346
The idea of a...

28
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:55,148
of a beautiful field
with solitude

29
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:58,318
that you can go to to just
get away from everything

30
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:02,556
and with a little village below
is-is definitely, uh...

31
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:06,093
you know, definitely resonates.

32
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:09,363
So maybe I...now that we're
moving back to the girl's world,

33
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:12,132
maybe it's time for me
to take more of these walks.

34
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:43,900
[Music]

35
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:48,802
Schafer: What is happening here?

36
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,337
What has been going on?

37
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:54,107
I've been so isolated
writing in here.

38
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,510
What else has been going on?

39
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,379
Every time I play the game,
it's got new crazy stuff in it,

40
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,580
which looks awesome.

41
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,682
Franzke: So here's the start screen.

42
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:07,320
And if I can basically
linear blend into 8-bit mode

43
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,589
and come out again and go back.

44
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:13,460
And the game is actually
full--fully playable.

45
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,229
Schafer: I don't know. Oliver just
snuck that in over the weekend.

46
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,831
He's like, "Hey, hit this--
hit this key."

47
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,299
And I was like, "Why?"
And I hit it.

48
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,101
It was like, pow, awesome.

49
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,170
Franzke: Um...and there are a bunch
of things that are happening.

50
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,605
I mean, obviously it's
pixelated, but we're also,

51
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,340
like, kind of compressing

52
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,009
the color range as well,
like in the old days.

53
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,544
So we're kind of
trying to emulate

54
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,446
that you only have 256 colors.

55
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,314
Like, since the beginning
of the project, I was like,

56
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,149
well, you know, I really like
the old-school games.

57
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,885
I like the pixelated art style
that we had back then.

58
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,856
Um...and then I was like,
well, I wonder if I can

59
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:45,225
just, like, take the image
and do some

60
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,762
just shader work to it to, like,
make it look like, you know,

61
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,564
it's a game made
in the '90s sometime,

62
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,299
like a little bit 8-bit.

63
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,768
Uh, and it works
pretty well, actually.

64
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,374
So far it seems okay, actually.

65
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,176
I thought I would be
way more stressed out.

66
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,812
So far it's okay, and probably,
uh, when you do the--

67
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,481
when you can do
the whole cutting thing,

68
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,082
you can cut, like, you know,
months in the future;

69
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,817
I will be sitting here like,
oh my God!

70
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,520
Schafer: And the team is bringing up
the last parts

71
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,523
of "Act 1" to alpha level.

72
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,524
Um, starting work
on the pyramid.

73
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,159
There's a pyramid
in the game

74
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,229
that's getting brought
to alpha this week,

75
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,231
and it's looking awesome.

76
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,666
Well, alpha is just that
there's something rough

77
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,301
in there
representing everything.

78
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,003
There's like, mm--
all the assets are, like--

79
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,305
Something's in there
taking a place for them.

80
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,374
And then--and then you get
them all workin' the way

81
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,676
you want them to for beta.

82
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,378
And then after beta,

83
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,148
you're hopefully
just fixing bugs.

84
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,516
Way ahead of schedule.

85
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:45,285
Rice: We're--we're good.

86
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,156
We're where I said we should be.

87
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,690
Schafer: Well, things move quick
once you--

88
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,159
You know, you have
certain deadlines.

89
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,628
Like, we wanted to get
a bunch of, um,

90
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,197
voice done so we could get
a PAX trailer.

91
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,332
And, um, also 'cause
the animators

92
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,301
are waiting for the voice
to start--

93
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,203
They haven't finished, like,
a single scene in the game yet

94
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:05,105
'cause then you want
the final voice in there.

95
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,374
So we wanna get that done,
and once it starts rolling,

96
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,709
it, um, it goes pretty quickly.

97
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,545
Crook: You know, when they play,
go through the playthroughs

98
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,346
and stuff right now,
sort of the animation

99
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:16,383
is sort of the least
polished, oftentimes.

100
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,752
And, um, and so sometimes
it's rough,

101
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,821
like, to sit through
playthroughs, you know,

102
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,390
and-and know that the quality
is not there yet

103
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,592
just 'cause you haven't
gotten to that phase.

104
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,527
Schafer: Greg came in;
he has a question for us.

105
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,129
Brown: Greg!
Rice: Hi.

106
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,497
Brown: How are you doing?

107
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,732
Rice: I am doing well, how are you?

108
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,367
Brown: Hey, I'm good.

109
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,736
Rice: Sweet. Um, no, I just,
uh, I got an email

110
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:40,540
from our new executive assistant

111
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,075
that was trying to set up
Tim's flights,

112
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,544
so I wanted to see
how things were looking

113
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,414
and if she should
go ahead and do that.

114
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:51,585
Brown: So if each one of these
characters has at least

115
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:56,289
80 lines to read, then, yes.

116
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,458
Rice: I think we're gonna
have enough written.

117
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,227
Schafer: So that's a question
for Malena or someone

118
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:01,595
with access to the database.

119
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,763
Rice: We can have Malena
run that right now.

120
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,432
Schafer: Okay. Today we're gonna start.

121
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,800
Please welcome Malena.

122
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,501
Malena Annable.

123
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,170
Annable: I'm so happy to be here
with you guys.

124
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,138
Schafer: Here in person.
She's come through the magic

125
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:15,308
of the screen to our world.

126
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,011
Just like the monsters
in "Pacific Rim."

127
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,779
She is a producer,

128
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,349
and she specializes
in localization

129
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,584
and things involving
the dialogue database.

130
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,519
Um...even though
she's up in Portland,

131
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,154
she remotely tracks
all that stuff

132
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,490
and she does localization
for all of our games.

133
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,160
And, um, she is the one pushing
on me for the writing deadline

134
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,496
to get it into Khris' hands,
'cause it kinda goes,

135
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,632
she gets the raw writing
and puts it in the database,

136
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:43,169
and, um, and gets the script
all ready to hand off to Khris.

137
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,008
That's a good question;
why is she here?

138
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,809
Maybe she's up to something.

139
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,746
Annable: Yeah, I wanna talk to you about
more dialogue things and...

140
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,447
Schafer: I have to write more dialogue?
Annable: Yeah, you do.

141
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,182
Schafer: God.
Annable: You don't want me to write it.

142
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,884
Schafer: Gotta be done by now.
It's gotta be done by now.

143
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:01,254
Annable: So, yeah, so I'm-I'm busy
with that all week.

144
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,790
I'm happy to see everyone.
Schafer: But if I write it this week,

145
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,492
it'll screw up the schedule,
'cause...

146
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,028
Okay.

147
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,562
Annable: So I want Tim
to write in the way

148
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,265
that whatever feels
most comfortable to him.

149
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,269
And as fast as possible.

150
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,105
Dialogue is so important
to our games,

151
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,474
so making sure that we have,
like, a really strong system--

152
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,510
I have--there's
a dialogue database

153
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,546
that Paul Du Bois built
and it's amazing.

154
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,548
And it's just--for me,
it's just management of,

155
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,217
like, you know,
tens of thousands of files.

156
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,719
I mean, "Brütal Legend,"

157
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,021
there are over 35,000 lines
of dialogue,

158
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,223
and I had to manage that
across five languages.

159
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:40,727
And...it wasn't that bad.

160
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:46,199
Rice: But, yeah, we could have Malena
check out current status

161
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,635
of lines per character.

162
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,771
And so if that happens,
you think, um, like,

163
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,074
casting-wise we'll be ready?

164
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,343
Brown: Um, I think we will.
I think we're, like--

165
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,044
I think by the end
of this meeting

166
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,779
we will know who we're gonna
choose for everything,

167
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,716
and then it'll be me calling
and checking avails

168
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,417
on them all for next week.

169
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,852
Schafer: And then a lot of our friends
are coming back.

170
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,287
Richard Horvitz,
the voice of Raz,

171
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:08,989
is gonna be doing some voices.

172
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,491
And Jennifer Hale, um,
from "Brütal Legend"

173
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,193
and "Mass Effect,"
is gonna be--

174
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:16,429
Yes, Shepard
is gonna be doing,

175
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,565
uh, I think
the Mom computer.

176
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:21,434
Um...and that's all
we have to announce

177
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,436
right now as far as voice,
but that's very exciting stuff.

178
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,138
Get that all wrapped up
so we'll actually have something

179
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:28,007
that we can put into the game
and show at PAX.

180
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,442
This weekend?

181
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,444
This weekend, oh my God,
it's coming up so soon.

182
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,847
We're flying down to LA to
record the voice for the game,

183
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,383
at least a third of it.

184
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,585
It's a third of the voice
for the game.

185
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,488
And we've got some, um,
interesting people

186
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,256
coming down to do voice.

187
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:47,460
Some old friends,
some hopefully new friends.

188
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,095
We'll be locked
in a room together,

189
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,997
me and Khris Brown,
for four days.

190
00:08:50,997 --> 00:09:04,517
[Music]

191
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,548
Horvitz: There is no room in the Space
Weaver's life for friendship.

192
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,683
Brown: Aww...
Horvitz: He slides alone,

193
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,820
like a shuttle of yarn
across the warp of time

194
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,622
on an ever so--shortening--

195
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,158
Schafer: Fucked that up.

196
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,026
How can you fuck that up?

197
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,494
You totally fucked that up.

198
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,695
Horvitz: I love that!

199
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:23,997
That is so fucking good.

200
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,165
All right. Here we go.

201
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,533
Schafer: It's kinda like he's Pee Wee,

202
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,700
rebel, loner.

203
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,835
Technician: And, 24.

204
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,437
Horvitz: Look, see, see,
look at this,

205
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,605
look at this island
in front right here, see?

206
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,374
And it's just like this
hairline's receding.

207
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,442
I can't stand it.

208
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,543
Brown: Really?
Schafer: Lice check? Lice check?

209
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,044
Brown: It looks good.
Horvitz: No, not...

210
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,646
Brown: Tim, you have lice.

211
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,514
We have never cast
a game this quickly.

212
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,383
Um, and we have
never cast a game

213
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,351
with, um, a budget
this limited.

214
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,487
I mean, it--
with the exception of, you know,

215
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,089
with "Day of the Tentacle,"
you have, like,

216
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,690
1,500 lines,
you know what I mean?

217
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,394
But even then, I think, um...

218
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:57,297
I think we probably spent more
money on "Day of the Tentacle."

219
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,065
That's Tim,
who started the company,

220
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,468
and he was one of the chief
game designers at LucasArts,

221
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:02,769
working on, like,
"Monkey Island"

222
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,771
and kind of this whole, um,

223
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,372
set or series of games

224
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,842
that people feel
really strongly about.

225
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,510
They have a really strong
emotional connection

226
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,312
to those games,
and then we've continued...

227
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,047
I started at LucasArts in 1990.

228
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,548
And there were 60 of us.

229
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,684
Like, LucasArts was 60 people.

230
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,186
I mean, we were a bunch
of goofball rejects.

231
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,523
It's not--it's not
how it is now,

232
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,492
where you have guys
who go to college

233
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:28,394
and then video games
is a place

234
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,830
where you can be
successful financially.

235
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,098
Do you know what I mean?

236
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,233
We were all kids

237
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,235
who were alone...

238
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,670
and computers were...

239
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,472
our friends, you know?

240
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,741
And so then we were
in a safe place

241
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,810
where we could be together.

242
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,478
So, yeah, we super bonded.

243
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,813
Um, all of us.

244
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,314
I mean, we all still
talk to each other

245
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,649
and I think we'll
talk to each other

246
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,551
for the rest of our lives.

247
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,620
Schafer: Yes, we do know
each other really well,

248
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,855
'cause she was back at Lucas
back in the '90s.

249
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,224
So we've known each other
for a long time.

250
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,594
You get into a lot
of strange, um...

251
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,129
kinda routines
in the studio.

252
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,464
When you--it's like--
for some reason,

253
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,165
sitting in the recording
studio is grueling.

254
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,800
Like, you're just sitting
in this little chair,

255
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,602
you're hearing voices,
but like after a day of that

256
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,504
you're like, oh my God,
I was in this tiny room all day.

257
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,007
Like, I mean, maybe it's
like editing for you guys.

258
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,708
But it's like,
you're in a tiny room,

259
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,610
faced with a big control panel
and you're talking

260
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,379
over this inter--I don't know
why it's so exhausting.

261
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,347
I am so delirious from
that 30-hour session

262
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,084
that I, uh, I don't even know
who I am anymore.

263
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,086
Brown: It's almost like it was
"Brütal Legend."

264
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,088
Schafer: Oh, God.

265
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,423
Thirty hours.

266
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,359
I delegated all the hard
sessions of that one.

267
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,794
I only come
for the movie stars.

268
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,129
Brown: You're tellin' me, man.

269
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,301
Schafer: I mean, I only come
for the stuff.

270
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,602
Brown: You only come
for the important stuff.

271
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:44,704
Schafer: I leave the stuff where
the script is really

272
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,439
idiot-proof.

273
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,707
Do you like that term?

274
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,075
That's like a writing term.

275
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,844
Like, it's director-proof.

276
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,313
Yeah.

277
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,081
In screenwriting
class they're like,

278
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,016
"You gotta really write your
script so it's director-proof."

279
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,985
Brown: That's because people
were working with directors

280
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,453
who aren't me.

281
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,456
Schafer: It's just--it's a...

282
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,426
That's obviously
not the way I feel.

283
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,794
Brown: What?

284
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,196
Schafer: That's obviously
not the way I feel.

285
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,632
Brown: You just--okay, so I wanna
hear Frank's blowjob story.

286
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:14,133
No, your writing is awesome.

287
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,768
It's perfect and fantastic.

288
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,637
Schafer: It doesn't compare
to Frank's blowjob story.

289
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:22,575
So in between takes, um...
you just start to, um...

290
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,111
for some reason tell
extremely dirty jokes.

291
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,046
This is going in a weird
direction, obviously.

292
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,149
Brown: Well, the camera's off, right?

293
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,585
Schafer: Nope.

294
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,354
It's like, um,
going to some weird,

295
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:37,624
uh, foxhole
or trench together.

296
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,325
Technician: Hi, Jan.
[Offscreen] Hey, how are ya?

297
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,194
Technician: I'm good, how are you?
[Offscreen] Good. Good to see you.

298
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,129
Technician: You too.
[Offscreen]Check, check, check, check.

299
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,364
Check, check.

300
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,299
Check, check, check, check.

301
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,767
Cash, cash, cash.
Mark?

302
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,268
[Technician] Yeah, you're--no, you're good.

303
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,337
No, please no more.

304
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,273
Schafer: The boy, Shay,
that's the story about a boy

305
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,209
who was, um,
raised essentially

306
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,044
by a giant spaceship
all by himself,

307
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,646
and he lives alone
on this giant spaceship

308
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,347
and it's very quiet
and lonely.

309
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,716
Um, and he's cared for by...

310
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,551
uh, there's a mom
and a dad that appear

311
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,553
on the computer screens
and take care of him.

312
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,122
And these big, like,
knitting arms

313
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,024
come down for the mother
and that's you, the mom.

314
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,859
Hale: Oh...
Schafer: And it was great when he was 7,

315
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,427
but now he's 14,
he's startin' to feel

316
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,129
like he's tired
of this kid stuff

317
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,497
and he wants to do
something real with his life

318
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:18,731
and go out on adventures.

319
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,733
And so he meets
this shady character...

320
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,802
People who do--the professional
voice talent people,

321
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,071
like Jennifer Hale
and Richard Horvitz,

322
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,106
who just do this all the time,
they walk in the studio,

323
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,508
they don't know anything
about it, they grab the script

324
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,276
and they cold read it,
and they nail it

325
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,111
after a couple lines
like that.

326
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,248
Brown: And they walk in, and it's like,
okay, they gotta pull it out.

327
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,116
So it's--it is the hardest--

328
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,085
you know, as Jen Hale says,
she's like,

329
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,020
"It's not just acting,
it's acting on steroids."

330
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,655
It is the hardest job.

331
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,259
And you can't rely on
your facial expressions.

332
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,795
And how frantic
is she when she's,

333
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,630
um, "Shay, where are you going?

334
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,800
It's not safe. Shay!!!"
with three exclamation points?

335
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,036
Schafer: Um--
Brown: Is it like yelling, or...?

336
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,671
Hale: On a scale of 1 to 10.

337
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,607
Schafer: Um, she--this is when even
more hell has broken loose.

338
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,309
Like, the ship is actually
being attacked now,

339
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,844
and Shay is running
to go fix it.

340
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,312
He's gonna go get
his space suit.

341
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,613
And he's running
down the hallway,

342
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,015
and so you're
in one of the orbs

343
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,616
and you're doing
your normal thing, like,

344
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,285
trying to calm him down,
but then he's not stopping

345
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,853
and you're like,
"Hey, he's not listening to me.

346
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,254
He's not listening to my--

347
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,622
He's not being
calmed down by my thing.

348
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,224
And then, what's he doing?"

349
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,259
Hale: Okay, so 4:48, is it,

350
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,828
"Dear God, he's going to die,"

351
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:24,464
or is it, "Hey, listen to me"?

352
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,866
Schafer: No, it's the--it is the first--
the former more.

353
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,868
Hale: "Dear God, he's going to die."

354
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,337
Schafer: Like he--like's running out
into a tornado, kind of like--

355
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,172
Hale: He's running
into a tornado, okay.

356
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,308
Shay!
There you are.

357
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:38,277
Something's happened
to the ship, but don't worry.

358
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:41,114
Your father's
gone out to fix it.

359
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,682
Shay, where are you going?

360
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,250
It's not safe!

361
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,585
Shay!!!

362
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,387
Brown: There we go.
Schafer: Wow.

363
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,490
Schafer: Nice.
Brown: Perfect.

364
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,492
You know,
and the actor loved it.

365
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:57,130
I mean, you really want an actor
who loves what they do.

366
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:02,635
I don't hire celebrities
for a payday.

367
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,804
At any other company,
at any other studio,

368
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:07,106
people will say,
"Oh, let's get so-and-so!

369
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,777
You know, we're X studio,
we have X million dollars.

370
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,345
Let's just pay them,

371
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,080
because it's gonna be
rear ends in seats."

372
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,848
And I'm like,
why do you want someone

373
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,650
who's only here
for a payday?

374
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,519
Otherwise, it's a waste.
It's a waste of money,

375
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,354
it's a waste
of the actor's time.

376
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,989
You don't want someone
who's just, like,

377
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,757
not having fun
and not into it.

378
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,325
And that's the thing
about Tim's writing

379
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,094
and that's the thing
about Double Fine,

380
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,497
is that it's so incredibly
rewarding, the actors,

381
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:35,067
they come in and they do it
for essentially what's free.

382
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,070
Hale: All missions are cancelled.

383
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,605
I love you.

384
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:46,012
Brown: Good. Can we get,
um, three in a row,

385
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,747
um, slow and super sincere?

386
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:50,783
Hale: Uh-huh.
Brown: Of "I love you"s?

387
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,819
Schafer: Is that just
for personal use?

388
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,687
He--this boy is--
now that he's 14,

389
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,223
he's startin' to feel like,
"I'm sick of these--

390
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,826
I wanna do some actual action
and get out there."

391
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,662
Kaufman: Yeah.
Schafer: And that's when he meets Marek.

392
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,363
He's, like, the wolf

393
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,865
who comes out of the cracks;
he's been watching.

394
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,434
Brown: Do you wanna hear the aud,
or are you good?

395
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,136
Kaufman: Uh, yeah,
I'll listen to it again.

396
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,105
I-I-I...you mean, my, uh...?

397
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,440
Brown: Your read?
Kaufman: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

398
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,677
David Kaufman, Marek.

399
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:21,447
You came because you are done
with children's games.

400
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,383
My name is Marek,
and what I'm about to show you

401
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,118
is no game.

402
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,854
Schafer: We were talking about that
when we were casting.

403
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,755
It was like, well, we have this
other guy we know can do it,

404
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,824
but I really like this guy's
voice, and it's new.

405
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,526
And I usually tend to go
for that, like,

406
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,394
really unique voice
more often,

407
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,396
even though it's a risk,
because sometimes

408
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,198
you bring somebody in
'cause you like the audition

409
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,733
and you don't know
anything else about them

410
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,435
and it turns out they
can't do anything else

411
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,704
except for that exact thing
they did in the audition.

412
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,305
Or they can't hit
the audition again.

413
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,740
Sometimes we've
had people come in

414
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,308
and they just can't seem
to capture

415
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,677
the magic
of the audition again.

416
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,746
And even--
so we'll play it for them,

417
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,715
like, "Listen to this audition."

418
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:58,084
And they'll be like, "Um...
I don't wanna do it that way."

419
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,453
He's--the way you read that
is a nice contrast to the mom,

420
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,355
who's--the computer
is like this--

421
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,156
the ship's computer is like this
really over-mothering mother

422
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:07,325
who's just, you know,
everything is sweet

423
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,194
and she's being so sweet
to the boy all the time,

424
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,795
and then you're just, like,
you're not cutting him any slack

425
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,330
and you're just like,

426
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,865
"I'm not here to love you,
right?

427
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,166
There's war going on."

428
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,002
Kaufman: Tell no one.

429
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,704
Do you understand?

430
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,444
No one.

431
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,046
Schafer: Whoa.

432
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,281
Kaufman: No one.

433
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,750
Schafer: I like that; scary.

434
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,752
Kaufman: No one.

435
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,186
Brown: Perfect.

436
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,788
Yeah, having this dude
in here has just, like,

437
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,490
made the game, like,
whoa, fuck.

438
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,592
I mean, to see those people
come to life, I mean,

439
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:43,462
as you saw with Marek, like,
all of a sudden, you know,

440
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,298
it wasn't just these
lines on the page.

441
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,732
It was like, holy shit.

442
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,367
Like, yesterday when
I was listening to him

443
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,669
I was like, oh-kay.

444
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:53,372
This game, uh...um...

445
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,274
It's not just a funny
thing anymore.

446
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,443
Like, it's not just like,
oh, this is really sweet

447
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,779
and we have this sweet boy
and he's coming of age.

448
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:04,083
But once we had Marek,
it's like, that's the linchpin,

449
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,118
do you know what I mean,
for the boy's story.

450
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:09,789
Like, once we have him,
that was crazy, you know?

451
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,024
And I--and I went home
and I was like, okay,

452
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,260
this game has a heart,
it lives and it breathes,

453
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,196
because we have that conflict
and we have that intrigue.

454
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,232
And that's, I mean,
that's so amazing.

455
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,268
The game went from being,
like, oh my God, it's cute

456
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,203
and it has beautiful
characters and da-da-da.

457
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,771
But, like, Marek--
And I'm--

458
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,807
seriously, like, I am--
these guys will tell you,

459
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,209
like, one, I'm s--
a total super bitch.

460
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:34,380
Two, like, like,
there's--I--like...

461
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,082
There's no reason for me
to tell you this.

462
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,717
Like, there's zero, right?

463
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,720
Kaufman: That's awesome.
Brown: Yeah. It's fucking awesome.

464
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,022
Schafer: She's even understanding
what a bitch she is.

465
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,725
Also that.

[Music]

467
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,682
[Mario game sounds]

468
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,851
Schafer: Sorry. I'm getting
really into this game now.

469
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,286
Brown: No, it's super cute.
I like the little sounds.

470
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:18,457
Schafer: Oh, I walked right down
the thing, the thing!

471
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,292
Brown: I really...

472
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:25,297
I'm trying to resist
getting...this.

473
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,099
Because I wanna play
"Animal Crossing."

474
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,768
Schafer: Get "Animal Crossing."
It's good for you.

475
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,536
Brown: I--no, I can't.

476
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,238
Schafer: "Animal Crossing"
made me a better person.

477
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:35,241
Brown: Really?
Schafer: Yeah, 'cause it's all about...

478
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,475
Brown: Making nice things?

479
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,777
Schafer: Just every day--
no, just every day

480
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,145
doing a little bit
of stuff.

481
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:41,047
Not, like,
rushing through things

482
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,615
for a goal
or anything like that.

483
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,183
It's really--
I think it's mentally good

484
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,751
for you to play it.

485
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:49,121
Dang it, I really suck
at this game.

486
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:53,159
Brown: 'Cause every minute that
I'm not either working or...

487
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,260
Schafer: Hello!

488
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:01,400
Hello there.
Black: Hi, Tim Schafer.

489
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,135
Schafer: Welcome to the project
"Broken Age."

490
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,538
Black: Thank you for having me here.
Is it well lit enough?

491
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,540
I feel like we're
in a dark shadow.

492
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,774
Here we go.

493
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:13,479
Schafer: I feel good about this. Good.

494
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,847
Black: Tell me about the project.

495
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,148
What are we doing today?

496
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,483
Schafer: I'm so glad that you asked.

497
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,018
Black: Is this who I'm
gonna be voicing?

498
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,720
Brown: Yes.
Schafer: Yeah, Harm'ny.

499
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,721
We're, like--yeah,
he's kinda like a guru.

500
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,156
Brown: He's like
a cultic personality.

501
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,524
Schafer: And a little,
like, not shady,

502
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,693
but a little bit like,
"Heyyy, hey."

503
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,195
'Cause he's a little bit
of a fraud.

504
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,329
Black: Okay. I have no idea
what's going on.

505
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,098
Schafer: And Harm'ny's main thing,

506
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,699
he runs the cloud colony,
that's his main thing.

507
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,701
Black: Harm'ny is a cult leader.
Schafer: Yeah.

508
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,703
And a little bit of a fraud.
Black: And he runs the cloud colony.

509
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,605
And is he also
like other gurus,

510
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,007
where it's also about,
like, uh...

511
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,443
"Let me give you my seed.
It's--believe me, this is--"

512
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,246
Brown: See? All the guys wanna
touch your vagina.

513
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,248
That's what I said:
Does he wanna touch vaginas?

514
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,883
Because all those dudes do!

515
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,284
Schafer: We don't really--

516
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,086
Black: Well, all the gurus,
it comes down to--yeah.

517
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,155
Brown: For sure!
Schafer: We don't really explore that

518
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:57,623
very much in the game,
but I don't think it's--

519
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,592
Black: No. And we don't need to.

520
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,494
It's-it's-it's there, though.
It's underneath.

521
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,762
Brown: It's implied, it's implied.
Schafer: I think people assume.

522
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,500
Seeing Jack again
was really fun.

523
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,804
Um, I haven't seen him for--
since the end of "Brütal."

524
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,539
And so it was fun
to see Jack again.

525
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:14,840
He was a good sport.

526
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,342
Black: I feel like
I need to research

527
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,144
a little while
before I start acting.

528
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,079
Schafer: We told you way too much.

529
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,814
Okay, so there's
a few lines today

530
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:23,616
and there'll be more in--
we haven't done--

531
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,584
we've only written the first
half of the game so far.

532
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,486
So when we're at the second
half, I hope we can get you

533
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,789
to come back again, yeah.

534
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,223
Black: Okay, you ready?

535
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,625
Technician: Cool, I'll give you
a take number,

536
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,827
then we'll be rolling,
and if you need

537
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,495
your headphones adjusted,
just let me know.

538
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,630
Black: All right, and...

539
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,098
Technician: It's take 1.

540
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:42,134
Black: Take 1, self "Action."

541
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,737
Oh-ho-ho, oh my!

542
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:50,176
A fresh face rises from below.

543
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:52,044
Oh my!

544
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:56,182
A fresh face rises from below.

545
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:57,817
Oh my!

546
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,119
A fresh face rises from below.

547
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,287
Schafer: I like that.

548
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:04,423
Black: Wait, let me be more of
a cult guy.

549
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,525
Oh my!

550
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,460
Oh my...

551
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,863
Oh my goodness.

552
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:13,699
A fresh face rises from below.

553
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:14,834
Hello.

554
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,136
Before you ask,
let me answer.

555
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:20,272
Yes, you may live here
in Meriloft forever.

556
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,674
Brown: That's perfect.

557
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,242
Schafer: I love that gentle version
you just did.

558
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:24,510
Brown: Love it.
Schafer: That's awesome.

559
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,679
Black: Before you ask,
let me answer.

560
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,683
Yes...you may live here
in Meriloft forever.

561
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,218
Schafer: Yaaay, I love that one.

562
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:33,819
Black: Oh, now we're gettin'
somewheres.

563
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,554
Schafer: Yeah, it was really fun
to watch Jack come in there

564
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,122
and just start with one thing
and he does it

565
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,857
over and over again
and he kinda hones in

566
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,392
on the character.

567
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,860
And we're not directing him,

568
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,495
but we're directing him
by not directing him

569
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,664
in that he knows that
if we hear something

570
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,399
we really, really like,
we'll chime in and be like,

571
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,368
"That! That's perfect.
That's amazing."

572
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,537
So if he's not hearing anything,
he's just gonna keep working it

573
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,273
and working it until, you know,
he gets something that he likes

574
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:56,008
and then we'll
probably like it, too.

575
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:59,545
Black: What? No!
What? No!

576
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,314
Uh...I mean...

577
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,016
Take it away.

578
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,985
I need it like I need a--

579
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:08,487
I need it like a blue jay
needs a bowling ball.

580
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,756
Schafer: Maybe he--yeah, he really
recomposes himself

581
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,726
and does--goes back to his
total, like, smooth guy voice.

582
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,761
Black: Oh, okay, yeah.

583
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,463
Black: What? No!

584
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:21,300
I'm...uh...I mean...

585
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,302
take it away.

586
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:26,205
I need it like a blue jay
needs a bowling ball.

587
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:28,440
Brown: Good.
Schafer: That's awesome. Great.

588
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,009
Black: Am I--am I all finito?

589
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,343
Brown: Yeah.
Schafer: That's it for now.

590
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,646
Black: That was so easy!
Schafer: That's so easy!

591
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,350
Yeah, I do have the little one,
and this one.

592
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,486
Black: I feel like I should do
something dramatic so that--

593
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:43,489
Schafer: You wanna punch me?
Black: Yeah.

594
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:47,793
That'll teach you to not give me
a very big part in your game.

595
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,762
Schafer: That felt right.
That felt good.

596
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,864
That was dramatic.

597
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,766
Crook: How was recording?
Was that good?

598
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,334
Schafer: Oh, yes.
This is, like, like, dailies.

599
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,435
Rice: Tell us all about it.

600
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,003
Schafer: Uh, recording was--was awesome.

601
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,674
Yeah, Marek was awesome.
He does this kinda creepy thing.

602
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:03,342
Kipnis: Who is he?
Rice: Who is he?

603
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,577
Schafer: He's...he's someone
who does a lot of game--

604
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,546
no, a lot of game work,
but, um--

605
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,048
Kipnis: Was it Lee?
Schafer: I didn't recognize his name.

606
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,182
It was Lee Petty.

607
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:13,285
No, he did it
different than Lee.

608
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,521
Like, Lee was kinda like,
"Yeah, you, gah..."

609
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,222
That sounds like Lee.
Rice: Yeah.

610
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,558
Schafer: He was more like,
"Come here further--"

611
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,794
He was--he did it
a little creepier.

612
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:25,564
"While you've been traveling
and plating ice cream..."

613
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,800
Rice: Oh, that's awesome.
Schafer: "...and playing with trains--"

614
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,035
And, uh, Richard Horvitz,
who did Raz,

615
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,404
did, um, a couple of characters.

616
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:33,706
And he did the Space Weaver.

617
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,374
Not as good, of course,
as Dave's,

618
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:37,776
but it is Raz.

619
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,414
None of the cut scenes
have been animated

620
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,516
because we just got
the professional VO in,

621
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,684
so you'll hear
the professional VO,

622
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:46,885
but we haven't animated to it,

623
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,554
so it's a lot of, like,
animatics,

624
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:50,022
like, sliding around,
which I'm sure

625
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,824
you've seen before
in games, maybe.

626
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,259
Rice: You gotta wait till you have
the voice to animate to it.

627
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,661
-Ah, okay, right.
Schafer: So some of the--

628
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,196
some of the background art
is final

629
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,798
and some of the in-game
animation is more final,

630
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,601
but, uh, the cut scenes
definitely get super janky.

631
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:06,839
Crook: We've got all the pro VO,
and so...

632
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:11,610
we just have too much work to do
for the animators that we have.

633
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,446
I mean, we used to have
a much bigger animation team,

634
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:17,016
uh, which was--
it was probably a little more

635
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,084
than double, maybe,
than what we have right now,

636
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,086
when we were on "Brütal Legend."

637
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,422
Um, and, you know,
people have left

638
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:28,027
and we've just never
replaced anybody, so...um...

639
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,729
So, yeah.

640
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:34,400
So, yeah, so we had to hire
an outside animation team

641
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,402
or a company.

642
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:38,137
Schafer: We have so much
animation to do,

643
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,772
we have to use outsourcers,
which we've never done.

644
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:41,840
I've never done outsourced
animation before

645
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,243
'cause we've always tested it
and it's always looked terrible.

646
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:47,179
But this group looks good,
and the test we did looks good,

647
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:50,282
and so hopefully they'll
just do some awesome stuff

648
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:53,585
that'll help us get
the game done on time.

649
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,554
Is that it?
Rice: Yep, I think so.

650
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,456
Schafer: Get it all out.
Let's outsource the rest of it

651
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,124
and take it--
call it a day.

652
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,526
Petty: Pleasure cruise.
Rice: Perfect.

653
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:01,593
Schafer: Woo!

654
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,466
Gardner: Oh, see, he's typing.

655
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:11,036
See, that's someone
typing in Portland.

656
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,172
What's gonna happen?

657
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,675
Look! See?

658
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,143
Aww.

659
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:19,545
See?

660
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:22,314
He, like--I think he
even is a backer, too.

661
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,483
Yeah, see, he is a backer.

662
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:25,551
Ha!

663
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,052
This is Alex.

664
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,387
He's the guy
that's supervising

665
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:30,289
all of the stuff
over at Super Genius.

666
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,357
And they're the people that
we're doing the contracting with

667
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,492
up in Portland.

668
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,529
So you can see
in this animation,

669
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,098
it's really--
this-this hand gesture

670
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,100
of the wolf, the attention
that somebody spends,

671
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,403
it really feels
like there's more

672
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:46,071
than just two drawings there.

673
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,240
And it's that sort
to attention to detail

674
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,142
that we just don't
have the time.

675
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,344
What we get with Super Genius
is that we get to add

676
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,812
all that character
to the animations

677
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,647
and we get to spend
all that time saying,

678
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:59,017
"Hey, this'll just be hilarious
if we make him, like, you know,

679
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:02,554
skip down the, you know,
the hill instead of just copy

680
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,389
the walk animation
and paste it there."

681
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,725
And we get the--
we get to add all that stuff,

682
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,261
but instead of
right now being like,

683
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,196
"What are we gonna do?
We're screwed!

684
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,398
Like, there so much work to do!"
And then you ship a game

685
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,200
and it's like you just look
at it and you're like,

686
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,835
wow, we didn't polish that,
we didn't polish that,

687
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,704
you didn't polish this,
you didn't polish that.

688
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:20,506
Like, there's always,
like--there's--

689
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:23,242
you ship a game and there's--
all you see is, as an animator,

690
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:25,077
is the stuff
you didn't polish.

691
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,278
And, uh...

692
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,315
You know, with Super Genius,
it's like hopefully what

693
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,251
we're gonna see is a game
where it's like

694
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:35,254
that game where you're al--that
I've always wanted to work on,

695
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:36,655
where everything's polished,

696
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,990
where you look at it
and you're like,

697
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,591
the whole thing is--is all--

698
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,660
is done all the way.

699
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,861
How about this?

700
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,464
Hey, Ray?

701
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,366
Will you--so--
Crook: I'm workin'!

702
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,734
I'm workin';
leave me alone.

703
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:51,436
Gardner: I know, I finally
got you workin'.

704
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,071
I want you to see this, uh--

705
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,274
Crook: I turned this over to you
so I could just work.

706
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,075
I'm just kidding,
I'm just kidding.

707
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,278
Schafer: Oh, yeah.
Our expert crack team

708
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:02,147
of judges
are the animation department.

709
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,583
I mean, the animators,
they're the ones who are--

710
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:07,319
Ray's the lead animator,
so he's in charge of making sure

711
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,821
that everything animated
on the project looks good,

712
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:13,492
including the outsourcing team,
so we leave that up to him.

713
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,794
Crook: Once we got
the--the pro VO,

714
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:19,765
it kinda changed
the wolf a lot for me.

715
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:24,436
It's fine. I mean, I don't think
Tim has seen this scene, so...

716
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,204
I hope he's--he's still okay
with--

717
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,174
See, I hope he's still okay
with that sort of, like...

718
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,475
Gardner: Oh, this?

719
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,311
Crook: The, like, poppy gestures,
you know?

720
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:35,747
Where he, like, comes up
and he's like, bum-bum, bump.

721
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,784
I mean, it's--
it's probably okay.

722
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,586
-It's probably okay.
Roberts: Yeah, it--

723
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:43,655
Until--until Tim sees it
and says--yeah.

724
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:47,159
Gardner: If he was--like, if he just
drew back slower--

725
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,226
Crook: Right.

726
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,494
Marek: Affirmative.
Crook: "Affirmative."

727
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,029
Yeah, I think we should
just slow it down.

728
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,631
I think he should be more like,
"Affirmative."

729
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:53,999
Gardner: All right, cool.
Then I'm gonna give 'em

730
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,267
the note to watch
out for that.

731
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,768
Crook: And just--just make it
less poppy.

732
00:28:56,768 --> 00:29:01,640
The--but he delivers it
pretty quickly, so...

733
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,875
We'd better let Tim choose.

734
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,345
And then-then-then-then
Elliott can win.

735
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,081
Roberts: Fuckin' Lee.

736
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,120
Schafer: All right.
Rice: Cool.

737
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,556
Schafer: Don't show this stuff.
Rice: I won't.

738
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,524
Just, it's pretty.
That's all you need to know.

739
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,860
Hamilon: Yeah, that this part
of the game is pretty?

740
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:26,465
Um...but yeah,
this--I mean...

741
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:29,501
Yeah, this is cool.
This game looks good.

742
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,269
I wanna play more.

743
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,405
When you--are you guys gonna
have a demo of this game?

744
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:36,508
Greg: Also meeting today
about a PAX demo, um,

745
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,777
and what the scope
of that will look like.

746
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,414
Start figuring out
a plan for that.

747
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:43,815
Schafer: Okay.
Rice: Should be fun.

748
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,717
Kipnis: I would...I would vote against

749
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,620
a public demo for now.

750
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,656
Schafer: What would we have at our booth,
then, if we...just do a trailer?

751
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:52,658
Rice: Nothing.
Schafer: What do you mean, nothing?

752
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:55,027
Rice: It'd mean we have no games
at our booth right now.

753
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,495
Schafer: I mean, depends how we show it.

754
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,397
Like, showing adventure games
on the--on the--

755
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:00,432
like, at E3 and stuff
was always a nightmare,

756
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:03,068
'cause, like, you can't get--
it's not like jumping into a mech

757
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:05,070
and shooting a bunch of stuff,
or even playing "Brütal Legend."

758
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:08,073
Like, so, you can't--
it's hard to really kind of--

759
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,208
I mean, now that we have--
that headphones are more common

760
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,044
and stuff, I think it's a little
easier to demo them.

761
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:14,046
But you're still, like--
sitting there for a while

762
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:16,348
being stuck on a puzzle is not
something that's fun to do,

763
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:19,284
and people are lining up
behind you to see the game.

764
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,886
Petty: The big problem with this
whole thing, potentially,

765
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:22,254
is that we're gonna disrupt
all this--

766
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:23,555
we just spent
all this effort

767
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,223
getting everything
into a flow

768
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:27,492
that's going to unblock
our dependencies.

769
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,394
And so even doing
any of this work

770
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,196
is probably going to
disrupt that somewhat.

771
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,365
It's hard to say how much
until we look at that.

772
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:36,802
But, um, polishing the spaceship
to beta right now,

773
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:38,470
uh, I think would be
the absolute worst thing,

774
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,072
because we have so much
areas of the game

775
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:41,707
that have issues we've
gotta work through.

776
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:43,675
And people like myself
and Bagel,

777
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,510
some of the animators,
need to stay out ahead

778
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,813
or we're gonna get
exactly where we were,

779
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:49,881
where everything's blocked up,
and part of that happened

780
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,783
because of the last
trailer we did.

781
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:54,353
I mean, obviously,
there's an undeniable benefit.

782
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,555
It's hard to quantify
the benefit, is always the issue

783
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:58,223
with making these decisions,
right?

784
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,559
'Cause, like, well,
people get excited

785
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,562
and that generates goodwill,
but...

786
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:05,530
Schafer: Like, the two things
that I want spoil each other.

787
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,432
Like, showing really
meaty gameplay

788
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,101
and not spoiling things are,
like,

789
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:12,003
kinda mutually exclusive.

790
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,473
Rice: All right.
This is all good stuff.

791
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:16,041
Schafer: Except you're doing the smile.

792
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,375
You're doing
the "I'm really unhappy" smile.

793
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,710
Rice: No, I'm not! I, like--

794
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,445
Schafer: "Yeah, life's shit
like I thought.

795
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,014
Yep, that's exactly what
I thought life was like."

796
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,716
Rice: No, I mean, I've always
been about trying to, like,

797
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,252
figure out how we can do it
without disrupting.

798
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,387
But, uh, now we just have
to figure out what that means

799
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,556
for our PAX plans, so...

800
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,558
Schafer: I mean, in the end it's not even
about it being disrupting.

801
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,594
I really don't care about
disrupting Lee at all.

802
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:37,129
I mean, it's really--
that does--no.

803
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:38,330
No, I mean,
it's not even about that.

804
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,731
It's like,
if we really felt like,

805
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,433
oh man,
it was such a juicy reward

806
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:43,135
at the end of it, like,
if it was really, like,

807
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,470
that demo would really
turn people, like,

808
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,472
millions of people
into fans of the game,

809
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,141
like, I feel like
it would be great.

810
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:51,309
But I feel like showing
the spaceship to the press

811
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,145
would not necessarily convert

812
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:56,114
a whole bunch of people,
you know, um...

813
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,583
Petty: Well, that's what I meant
by disruptive: Is it worth it?

814
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,052
Because like you said
in the earlier episodes,

815
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,854
no one cares how well
a game is produced.

816
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,756
I don't think anyone cares
how well a game is promoted

817
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,691
if it comes out
and it's not good.

818
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,027
Schafer: The one--at least the one
discipline here

819
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,829
that we can agree no one
cares about is production.

820
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,098
Crook: You said both those things.
Schafer: I don't remember saying that.

821
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,533
Petty: But, I mean,
it's the same thing.

822
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,535
Like, good production/promotion,
if it's not--

823
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:19,671
if we--you know, I want it
to be as good as it can be.

824
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,007
Rice: It's just a hard--like,
it became a lot more important

825
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:23,475
with all the press shit
that went down

826
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:25,043
'cause, like,
now what does it look like,

827
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,012
oh, suddenly we're taken
off the floor map of PAX

828
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,481
and we pulled out of PAX?
Like, that looks bad.

829
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:32,050
Schafer: That's 'cause I thought someone
was gonna throw acid in my face.

830
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,585
You can say that:
"Tim was worried about acid."

831
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:34,820
Rice: But, yeah.

832
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,321
Petty: Okay, but then
what if we showed

833
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,256
a press demo that
wasn't totally polished?

834
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,324
Which is worse?

835
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,026
Giving 'em ammo to hate on?

836
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:42,360
I think that's worse.

837
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,095
Schafer: Honestly, I--if I could
do anything right now,

838
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:46,198
it would just be
sit out this PAX.

839
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:48,033
Rice: Yeah, we--
Schafer: I feel like we just don't--

840
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,734
Rice: I think we might have to
if we don't do a demo.

841
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,603
Schafer: I don't know if--
can-can we, now?

842
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,605
Rice: We'd probably have
to pay for some stuff.

843
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:56,341
Petty: We could have
a kickass merch booth.

844
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,610
Rice: Uh, yeah...we could do that.

845
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:26,180
[Music]

846
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,506
Bagel: Uh, I think it's going good.

847
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,308
It's pretty rad.

848
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:34,246
I think we've all, like,
gotten a lot better at art,

849
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:36,248
you know, over the last year.

850
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:39,284
So lookin' at all the old stuff
is, like, kinda hard,

851
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:42,287
but we all see stuff, I think,
that we know we wanna change.

852
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:45,590
And, um, it's getting to
an exciting time right now.

853
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,860
Uh, it's polish phase,
you know, just figuring out

854
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,429
what we're gonna polish
and just lookin' back

855
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:56,101
at all of our old stuff
and bringing it all together

856
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:59,804
into an awesome game,
you know?

857
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,473
But, yeah.

858
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,008
I feel like it's goin'
pretty good.

859
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:04,876
Pretty exciting,
but it is also super scary

860
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,780
that we only have, like,
what, four months left.

861
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,815
Right?
But, yeah, I'm gonna go--

862
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:15,152
I'm goin' out to San Francisco
on the 16th of September,

863
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:17,454
and, um, I'm gonna be out there
for two weeks,

864
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,558
and we are gonna, like,
talk about polish,

865
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,795
figure out a plan,
and then just start nailing it.

866
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:41,040
[Music]

867
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,014
Schafer: We've got some professional
voice in the game now.

868
00:34:44,014 --> 00:34:45,616
You can hear--uh,
and it's awesome,

869
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:46,717
'cause they're good.

870
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,319
Black: Oh, my!

871
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,588
A fresh face rises from below.

872
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,590
Before you ask,
let me answer.

873
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,793
Yes, you may live here
in Meriloft forever.

874
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:59,030
Rice: Yeah, it's one of those
things that, uh...

875
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,534
changes, uh, the production
values of the game

876
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:04,235
in a very short amount of time.

877
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,104
Like, 'cause it
kind of all comes

878
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,572
in at once,
in one big chunk,

879
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,075
and suddenly you
go from having

880
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:13,244
very non-professional acting
to very professional acting.

881
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,714
And it--and it just, uh...

882
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:19,050
I think it just reminds
you it's real.

883
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,785
Schafer: A huge difference.

884
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,620
It's--it's huge.
I mean, we've been looking

885
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,522
at these temporary cut scenes
for so long where

886
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,558
the characters are all moving--
'cause they don't wanna put

887
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:28,560
a lot of work into it
until they have the final VO.

888
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,795
Now that we have the final VO,
they can just go to town.

889
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,731
And so we're gonna see, um,

890
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:34,499
a whole different
game experience

891
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,135
where it just feels
so much more polished.

892
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:41,172
Rice: And in a game that's so much
about character and story, um,

893
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,274
like, it's gonna be
really important

894
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,777
that that is sold correctly

895
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:47,679
and those actors
are selling it right.

896
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,015
So, you know,
Tim's an awesome writer,

897
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:52,250
and now to have, like,
people who are able

898
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,320
to take what he wrote
and, like, even make it better

899
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,423
is pretty amazing.

900
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:01,826
Schafer: And "Act 1" of our game is now
in alpha, which is exciting.

901
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,128
[Offscreen] Woo!
And--woo!

902
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,829
But it's lookin' good.

903
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,464
Rice: Cheers.

904

[Music]

905
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,384
Schafer: It's gonna be fun
when we can actually, um,

906
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:29,254
celebrate, you know, shipping.

907
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:31,122
And--but it'll be kind of sad,

908
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:34,092
'cause it's been kind of fun
to do all this and...

909
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:40,060
[Music]

910
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:43,101
I'm not gonna celebrate
till the whole thing ships.

911
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:45,236
I suppose we'll have
some sort of celebration

912
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:47,005
on shipping "Act 1."

913
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:48,707
Then I'm like, don't talk to me
until it's done.

914
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,275
April/May.
April/M--

915
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:53,344
Definitely between
April and November.

916
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,280
Depends on how many
the first act sells.

917
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,583
If it sells a lot, we'll just go
all the way into 2016.

918
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,187
Just kidding.

919

[Music]

920
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,297
Kaufman: Okay, that's all we can do.

921
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,099
We're pulling out.

922
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:52,203
Don't make the same mistake
you did last time, boy.

923
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:53,738
I-I don't understand.

924
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,341
What is it about this creature?

925
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,512
Brown: Excellent.

926
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:02,881
Schafer: Let's throw in for the fans--
edit together the lines

927
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,282
to make a big dirty, like,

928
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,117
"Spock and Kirk having sex" video.

929
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:10,054
I like to put stuff
in there for them.

930
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,990
"Pull out now, boy."

931
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:14,859
Brown: I just...

932
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,596
Schafer: "Think about baseball."
