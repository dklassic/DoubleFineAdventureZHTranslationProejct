1
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,294
Schafer: Oh, here's a copy of my 
notebook for Grim Fandango.

2
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,343
And then here's me trying to 
figure out the name of the game.

3
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,025
Dead Leads. Deadly Deeds.

4
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:32,065
Deeds of Death. Death's Deeds.

5
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,019
You know, I read my old names 
to you because Grim Fandango

6
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,820
was such a great name that it 
was funny to see all the bad names,

7
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,899
but right now I don't have a name 
for this game, so all these names, it's just sad.

8
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,300
I did make a nice chart, though.

9
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,400
Puzzles on it.

10
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,939
Don't show that.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,180
This is a horrible process, by the way.

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,420
It's just not going to have,

13
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,060
we're going to end up with 
some terrible name like Stacking.

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,160
Just kidding, Lee.

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:25,300
[Music]

16
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,054
Schafer: OK. So we'll start 
the email thread about this.

17
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,723
Thanks for everyone hustling
 to get the build running.

18
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:30,650
It worked great.

19
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,910
I was very proud of it.

20
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,870
It was awesome.

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,406
I hope no one's feelings got hurt. OK.

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,869
Awesome. Thank you.

23
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,729
Kipnis: I liked the little animation polish
that Chris did on that.

24
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,609
Choy: Do we just send our notes out?
Is that what we do?

25
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:42,609
Schafer: Yeah

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,140
Schafer: I like your cascading Post-its.

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:02:04,740
[Music]

28
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Schafer: Ron Gilbert.

29
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,220
Ron Gilbert, I've been pestering him 
to play the game and give us his feedback.

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,260
And he's been really busy 
but now The Cave is done

31
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,300
and now he's going 
to play the game.

32
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,367
He's going to play it.

33
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:20,528
All the Cloud Colony stuff 
that we have today

34
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,180
and then we're going to talk at 4:00.

35
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,680
He's going to tell me what he thought.

36
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,822
Offscreen: Why didn't he play 
the game during the HOF,

37
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:28,018
because I saw him in the meeting.

38
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,160
Schafer: Oh, he said he was going 
to play the game during the HOF,

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,780
but when I said, I kind of got 
the impression he has not played it yet.

40
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,540
I think he had a lot of email to read that day.

41
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
He's been busy.

42
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,580
He's not busy anymore.

43
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,840
You know, he's made some of these games before.

44
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,020
So he's got very particular things 
that he would do if it was his game

45
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,120
that might drive him crazy if we 
didn't do them the exact same way.

46
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,440
Schafer: So we'll find out.

47
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,120
I don't know.

48
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,780
What he'll think.

49
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,440
He'll probably say, eh, it's fine. 
Whatever. Who cares.

50
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,100
All right.

51
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,320
Schafer: Thank you for playing.

52
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,020
Do you have any general impressions 
of things you'd like to share?

53
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,080
Gilbert: Yeah, I think my 
general impression was that,

54
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,520
I mean, it's very interesting 
playing point-and-click games.

55
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,416
There's a certain, there's a 
certain serenity to them, which is nice.

56
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,047
You know, you just, I kind of felt like

57
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:32,047
I could just lean back in 
my chair and I could just think.

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,800
And there wasn't any pressure 
going on, which I kind of liked.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,541
So I thought it was very, 
you know, enjoyable experience

60
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:45,839
and then it kind of brought back, 
you know, some of those, you know,

61
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,740
really old, you know, 
point-and-click feelings.

62
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,660
Schafer: And these are my 
notes from Ron's play-through.

63
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:53,361
Tram puzzle, he liked the tram puzzle.

64
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:57,361
He had four things that he liked 
and he had three pages other stuff.

65
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,350
Gilbert: Do you want me to keep going?

66
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,830
'Cause I'm onto the do-not-like's now.

67
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,850
Schafer: Oh no, you don't do any of those.

68
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,690
Gilbert: OK, so I'm done.

69
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,870
Schafer: Wait. You've got four likes 
and then three pages of you-don't-likes.

70
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,542
Gilbert: And then three pages, well, you know...

71
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,274
Schafer: OK, let's go. Let's do it.

72
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,216
Gilbert: I'm not happy gamer, 
I'm grumpy gamer. OK.

73
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,823
Things that I did not like.

74
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,119
The dialogue trees didn't 
seem very focused to me.

75
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,960
Falling through the clouds 
was super annoying.

76
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,700
I thought the characters walked too slow.

77
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,400
Schafer: OK.

78
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,000
Schafer: The exit arrows.

79
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,700
He wanted exit arrows when 
you're just panning across the room,

80
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,215
which I don't know if I...

81
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,640
I don't know if I agree with that one, 
but it's worth thinking about.

82
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,060
And then I just had some 
ideas for dialogue while he was talking.

83
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,160
Was that decisive looking?

84
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,311
Schafer: Starting with some sad news.

85
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,240
I think some of you 
saw the email went out

86
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,880
that one of our co-workers is leaving

87
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,165
My old friend Ron Gilbert 
is going to be leaving Double Fine

88
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:03,369
and pursuing his, it's a big round of boo's for Ron Gilbert.

89
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,449
Boo.

90
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,760
[Laughter]

91
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,260
Boo-urns.

92
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,980
We don't handle 
good-byes well, Ron, here.

93
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,580
To pursue his lifelong dream 
of not working at Double Fine.

94
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,780
[Laughter]

95
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,060
Ron will be leaving pretty soon, like today.

96
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,400
He doesn't like long 
drawn-out emotional good-byes,

97
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,429
so he wanted to just 
leave and not just linger on.

98
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:35,861
But yeah, do you have a long speech 
that you'd like to make at this point?

99
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:36,701
Gilbert: I don't.

100
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
[Applause]

101
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:47,240
Schafer: And with those words, 
[Applause]

102
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,400
Schafer: He left.

103
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,160
Offscreen Voice: You knew 
he was leaving, you didn't tell anybody.

104
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,066
Schafer: Just a little while.

105
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:58,052
I mean, we'd talked about it like, 
pretty honest about, you know,

106
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,030
him coming to the company, doing a game.

107
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,877
What are you going to do after?

108
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,174
He didn't know.

109
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,216
He, Ron's pretty independent 
and has always, you know,

110
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,583
more naturally is kind of a loner, rebel.

111
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,628
Dangerous.

112
00:06:10,628 --> 00:06:11,648
Drifter.

113
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,929
And you can't keep him in a cage, man.

114
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:18,789
Can't just contain Ron Gilbert.

115
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,449
But we're sad to see him go.

116
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,749
I liked, I liked having Ron around.

117
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:26,169
He's like my older brother 
in the games industry, kind of.

118
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,171
Yeah, he said, he said he would still, 
every time I sent him a build,

119
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,000
he would play through it 
and give us some us some feedback

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,318
so hopefully we'll have him come back
 in or Skype with us from wherever he is.

121
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,993
Schafer: That's what he was going to do
 originally, was just play the game,

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,179
give us feedback, help us out to 
give us some, some, his opinion about stuff.

123
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,500
And he said he'd still do that,

124
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,760
so now we just don't have to 
pay him so it's kind of win/win.

125
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:50,284
Gilbert: ok 
Schafer: Any last words?

126
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,280
Say, say good luck.

127
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,940
It's going to be great.

128
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,952
Say good luck, it's going to be great.

129
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
Gilbert: Good luck, it's going to be great.

130
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,239
Schafer: Well, thanks, Ron.

131
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,542
Gilbert: I really look forward 
to playing it again, Tim.

132
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:02,622
Schafer: Awesome, thanks, great. OK.

133
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:18,680
[Music]

134
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,500
Schafer: You're all over the 
new episode, man, let me tell you that.

135
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,100
Schafer: Hello, everybody.

136
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,460
Hey, nice to see you all. Hello.

137
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,868
Thank you for coming.

138
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:31,329
Rice: For Red's, we got, 
Game Informer is going to be doing

139
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,280
a big spread on the game

140
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,340
and they're coming by in 
a week and a half to talk with Tim

141
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,040
and play the game and everything.

142
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,560
So it should be like a six-page 
spread coming out in April on that game,

143
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,100
which is right after our trailer.

144
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,920
So we're starting on that now, too.

145
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,486
But it's going to be busy PR times very soon.

146
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:55,024
During GDC we're doing a Brutal book
 launch party, so that should be good.

147
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:56,567
Everybody's invited to that.

148
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:58,527
And we'll get you details on that, too.

149
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,220
Lots of things.

150
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,544
Rice: So that kind of 
stuff has been happening now.

151
00:08:02,544 --> 00:08:06,983
We have this, this kind of 
schedule for our first little chunk of P R

152
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:09,151
and I'm sure there'll be more 
down the line as the game

153
00:08:09,432 --> 00:08:12,159
actually gets closer to coming out.

154
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,147
But this is more just a,

155
00:08:14,147 --> 00:08:17,113
for people who had never heard about Kickstarter or not anything about the game,

156
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:21,373
this'll be kind of the first time they hear about the game as a game

157
00:08:21,373 --> 00:08:24,894
instead of the game as a product of the Kickstarter.

158
00:08:24,894 --> 00:08:28,804
Rice: How is everybody feeling about
 showing the game in a week and a half

159
00:08:28,804 --> 00:08:31,504
and doing a trailer in three weeks?

160
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,740
It's crazy.

161
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,220
People are going to be 
talking about the game.

162
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,436
Schafer: It's easy, right?

163
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,200
Petty: I think it all hinges on 
how awesome the name is.

164
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,393
Petty: It's a small little tidbit.

165
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,040
It's your window into the game.

166
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,680
Rice: So it'll be actually, you know,
 announcing the name of the game.

167
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,062
Doing a teaser trailer and then 
also doing some interviews with press

168
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:57,262
and talking more in detail about 
what the game's actually about.

169
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,248
Petty: Ah, yeah, so.

170
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,695
Well, there's a lot of tasks related to all that

171
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,187
and I'd say it's probably going to take up two-thirds,

172
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:06,527
easily two-thirds of the sprint for the majority of the art team.

173
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,006
Rice: No, I mean, it's a hard thing 
because no matter what,

174
00:09:11,006 --> 00:09:15,349
showing the game publicly is 
going to eat into the schedule somehow.

175
00:09:15,349 --> 00:09:17,336
Whether it's a trailer or a demo.

176
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,413
Like there's always going to be work that's done specifically for that,

177
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,940
that wouldn't have been done otherwise.

178
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,134
But I think it's just a matter of 
you got to talk about your game

179
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,411
and you have to like get out there.

180
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,924
Otherwise you might make a great game,
 but nobody knows about it.

181
00:09:31,924 --> 00:09:37,244
So it's just kind of give or take of 
let's figure out the points in the schedule

182
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,377
where we're going to be able to insert 
these things with the least amount of pain,

183
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,161
but also to get like the biggest 
positive affect for the game.

184
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:47,951
And I think that just 
happened to be right now

185
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,652
because this is when PAX is 
and GDC and all the big conventions.

186
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,094
And so we want to take 
advantage of those things

187
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,980
falling in line with our dev cycle

188
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,362
and try to figure out ways to have something 
at those events that people will be

189
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:05,360
excited about while still minimizing 
the impact on production of the game.

190
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,825
Rice: So Game Informer stuff.

191
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:10,223
And they're obviously flying someone out here.

192
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:13,224
So we have to try to figure out 
a part of the game

193
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:17,218
that they could play that would like hold up all right.

194
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,060
Schafer: I mean, Cloud Colony's 
was the thing we HOF'ed, so it's playable.

195
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,383
Petty: So I think the thing we're needing 
on that for you and Tim

196
00:10:27,383 --> 00:10:30,554
or Tim and you to play 
through the Cloud Colony

197
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,000
and identify kind of what your demo loop is

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,211
and see if there's any additional 
polish you want us to do.

199
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,360
Rice: Yeah, well, so he's coming
 Wednesday, next Wednesday.

200
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:43,829
So I would imagine we want a good, 
at least half day of hammering from tests,

201
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:46,582
just to make sure everything is... 
Kipnis: At least.

202
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:47,652
Rice: what we think it is.

203
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,280
Yeah, so I don't know.

204
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,698
Do you want to try to lock it down Monday night

205
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,720
or do you want to lock it down 
to Tuesday afternoon?

206
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,403
I mean, he's not coming 'til 
afternoon Wednesday.

207
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:59,183
So we have Wednesday morning also.

208
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,247
Kipnis: Yeah, let's not, let's not, 
let's not take it to the wire like that.

209
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:06,832
Let's just aim for Monday end of day,

210
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,561
which may be like before Tuesday 
10:00 a.m. or something.

211
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,040
Rice: I'll write down "end of day Monday".

212
00:11:15,473 --> 00:11:18,453
Kipnis: It's kind of what I'm working on right now, 
is making her movements

213
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:24,586
be at a good speed and also, 
look right with animation.

214
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,420
So this is her like running.

215
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,020
So like, you know, clicking kind of close by,

216
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,415
she'll do a walk, but clicking 
sort of far away, she'll run over.

217
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,688
But the fact that she switches 
to and from, faster,

218
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:37,402
travel method is good ultimately.

219
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:38,902
We just need it to look good.

220
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,140
It'll take a little bit of animation for that.

221
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:44,760
Rice: Cool. All right.

222
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,798
I'm going to jump on that call, but this is good.

223
00:11:46,798 --> 00:11:50,601
It feels like it's not far off at all.

224
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:52,201
Kipnis: No, no, it's not so bad.

225
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,600
Rice: All right. Thanks, guys.

226
00:11:55,123 --> 00:11:56,623
OK, cool.

227
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,997
Rice: Water? Soda?

228
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,000
Turi: I'll grab a water.

229
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,900
Rice: All right. Turi: Thanks.

230
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,560
Rice: Have you been here before?

231
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,460
Rice: The nature of being in a magazine
 business is that they have a lot of

232
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:20,200
readers, so they get a lot of big exclusives
 because they have such a, a wide reach

233
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,280
and it's a place that people go 
often to announce their games

234
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,720
or show really early stuff.

235
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,055
And so they're used to seeing busted 
builds and bugs and whatever.

236
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,880
And...

237
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,360
Why is this ringing?

238
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,520
Double Fine.

239
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,940
Voice on Phone: Hi. 
I'm looking for Tim Schafer.

240
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,060
Schafer: That's our mobile 
kind of guy over there.

241
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,046
This is our R&D group doing secret stuff.

242
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
That's Oliver. 
He's our lead programmer.

243
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,160
Franzke: Nice to meet you.
Turi: Nice to meet you, Tim.

244
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,980
Kipnis: Hi, how's it going?

245
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,880
Turi: Good. Nice to meet you.
I'm Tim from Game Informer.

246
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,280
I just watched your side quest thing so,

247
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,054
I know way more about you 
than you do me, but that's all right.

248
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,760
Turi: You guys are talking, 
did you say that you're thinking,

249
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,720
what is the release date, like the 
projected release date or window for...

250
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,380
Schafer: Who's saying...
Rice: We're still working on that.

251
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,040
Schafer: Later. 
Turi: Yeah, OK.

252
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,090
Schafer: Later this year.

253
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,465
Rice: Yeah, I mean it's hard 'cause 
it's still being designed

254
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,852
and you know, still working on it.

255
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,616
Turi: They said, they said just holiday.

256
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,144
But is it, is there any chance for that at all?

257
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,342
Like with the...

258
00:13:25,342 --> 00:13:26,362
Schafer: Getting this game done by the holiday?

259
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:27,642
Can we get this game done by the holidays?

260
00:13:27,642 --> 00:13:28,722
Rice: Up to you, man.

261
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,560
Schafer: So i'll click right here first, 
just to set things up.

262
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,040
It's a point-and-click graphic adventure,

263
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,920
Turi: Oh, you guys are excited about that

264
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,437
Schafer: Yeah, remember that thing from the pitch video?

265
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,582
So you walk around.

266
00:13:46,582 --> 00:13:48,638
You have an inventory down here to bring up.

267
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,140
Right now, 
Turi: It's cool.

268
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,551
It's cool as it always is, you know.

269
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:56,241
I'm in a, I'm in a position of like
 responsibility when it comes to this.

270
00:13:56,241 --> 00:13:57,641
And like there's a big 
responsibility that comes with

271
00:13:57,641 --> 00:13:59,376
checking the game out for the first time

272
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,747
and I'm really excited to see 
what people have to say about this,

273
00:14:01,747 --> 00:14:05,047
because this is sort of a game out of time.

274
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:09,327
You know, it's something that's a relic, 
but it doesn't look like one.

275
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:11,474
But you know, the genre is 
something that hasn't been really

276
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:15,334
around much outside of like 
The Cave and them some like indie games.

277
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,034
I love having the responsibility of, you know,

278
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,589
taking this experience with like Tim and Greg,

279
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:25,129
checking out the game and presenting it 
to our readership, you know.

280
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:27,009
So they can keep it on the radar or not.

281
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,564
Schafer: I don't know.

282
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:31,392
I don't like showing the game 
ever before it's done.

283
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:33,652
There's a, it's like people have 
to force me to show it.

284
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,569
Like I always joked that I would 
never show the game at all,

285
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:38,672
except for to my family 
and that's only when it's done.

286
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,511
But I wouldn't let them take 
the shrink wrap off it, ideally.

287
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,740
Because it's never quite done.

288
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,199
Schafer: And this is a preview; 
that's one thing.

289
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,482
Previews are pretty usually 
pretty gentle on you.

290
00:15:00,726 --> 00:15:04,363
I mean, they normally don't be like 
oh, man, I just saw a sneak peek.

291
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:06,248
This game's the worst I've ever seen.

292
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:07,853
They're usually like, yeah, 
they're working on it.

293
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:10,208
Here's what they're working on 
and we hope it turns out cool,

294
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,419
'cause they'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

295
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:15,939
Then they send a different person in 
to review it, who's like, just a total dick.

296
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,980
Especially at Game Informer.

297
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,881
Schafer: So there you have it.

298
00:15:20,881 --> 00:15:21,806
Those are our kids.

299
00:15:21,806 --> 00:15:26,026
So we now, what do you think 
the best title is for this story?

300
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,280
Turi: Yeah, this is a difficult thing, 
probably to name, I assume.

301
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,365
Rice: We've got ideas.

302
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,780
Schafer: We ain't got nothing.

303
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,123
There was Young Monsters.

304
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:41,023
Turi: OK. 
Schafer: Small Offerings.

305
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,511
Turi: Hey, I like that.

306
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,800
Schafer: Broken Age.

307
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,986
Schafer: But yeah, so we're going 
to keep coming up with some ideas

308
00:15:50,986 --> 00:15:53,760
and we'll definitely have it to you by Wednesday. 
Turi: OK.

309
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,122
Rice: Tuesday. 
Turi: Tuesday.

310
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,733
Always trying to push it.

311
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,035
Always get one more day.

312
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,760
Rice: I don't think you can stop the printing press.

313
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,585
Schafer: Usually I have the game 
named and the characters named

314
00:16:03,585 --> 00:16:04,865
before we talk to people.

315
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,885
So I don't know if the press is 
early or the game is late.

316
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:08,985
Probably the game is late.

317
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,219
But it's not that late.

318
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,455
It's great.
Game is doing great.

319
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,593
Backers. 
Don't worry about it.

320
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,680
It's doing fine.

321
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,460
Schafer: Here's another fun trick to do.

322
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,380
Young Monsters.

323
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,000
That font is terrible.

324
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,020
This is the laziest box art ever.

325
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,380
Ah, that's hyphenated.

326
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,480
Ah, fuck it.

327
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,019
Schafer: I thought I'd come up 
with a great title this weekend,

328
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,140
but I chose not to.

329
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,583
Crook: Did you come up with any bad ones?

330
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,893
Schafer: And I could just name the damn kids,

331
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,680
I could just call it the game 
whatever their names are.

332
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,400
Like Banjo Kazooey.

333
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,380
Ryken: I think you just need 
to spend a day dressed up

334
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,240
halfway as a girl and halfway as a boy.

335
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,647
Schafer: Dream on.

336
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,547
Ryken: It'll come to you.

337
00:17:04,547 --> 00:17:05,767
Schafer: I know what you're after.

338
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,729
Schafer: So the process was kind of grueling,

339
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:09,379
'cause the game's already so established,

340
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,210
it's always hard to name a game 
when it's already established.

341
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,530
It's a lot easier to do it before 
you've, before you've done anything,

342
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,285
'cause then the design kind of, you feel 
like you're just building on that name

343
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:20,739
as opposed to attaching a name later.

344
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,288
Petty: The reason why I'm really enjoying
Tim's struggling with names

345
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:26,208
is because I got a year of shit 
from Tim about the name Stacking.

346
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,140
And I never came up with anything better.

347
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,229
Schafer: I don't know.

348
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,640
This is the team's suggestions.

349
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,565
The Distant Neighbor. A Girl and Boy.

350
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:39,311
The Encounter. A Tale of Two.

351
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,246
Kindred Odyssey. The Unfinished Bridge.

352
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:43,260
The Strange Offering. The Kind Double Creatures.

353
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,259
The Kind Endangered Creatures. 
Mom Can Be Annoying.

354
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,711
Get Off My Back. Divided Interest.

355
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,653
Dude, Where's My Ship? Collision Course.

356
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,820
Collision Curse. Similar Lines.

357
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,134
Deep Lines. Split Decision.

358
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,460
True Lies. Collateral Damage. Predator.

359
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,740
Schafer: It's hard to come up 
with space names, ask George.

360
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,960
Greedo? Come on.

361
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,440
Crook: Prune Face?

362
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,640
Franzke: Can I also ask, 
so the trailer, what is the actual,

363
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,780
what's, what's up with that?

364
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,342
Are we, are we planning on rendering 
that in game, what is the scope?

365
00:18:17,342 --> 00:18:21,209
Rice: So we, I talked with Lee 
and Tim about like a script for it

366
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:23,115
and Majus is doing an 
animatic for that right now,

367
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,958
so hopefully within the next few 
days we'll start seeing what that looks like.

368
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,200
Just so you guys can see what 
scenes and everything will be in it.

369
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,666
Rice: Yeah, but it's just a matter 
of what we can pull off, right?

370
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,840
And I think that for now,
 just talking about the trailer

371
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,380
is probably the most time sensitive thing.

372
00:18:36,702 --> 00:18:43,289
But I guess the idea is to try to 
get something that would be, you know,

373
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:48,117
exciting enough for people to 
see onstage at GDC awards

374
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,535
or just kind of a large event.

375
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,120
Rice: The next big thing is the GDC thing.

376
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,555
So Tim's hosting the award show and
 we've been working on a teaser trailer,

377
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,617
like a short little 45 second thing

378
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,740
showing the actual game 
in motion for the first time.

379
00:19:02,987 --> 00:19:04,547
Schafer: I was imaging we would take the approach of

380
00:19:04,547 --> 00:19:07,209
looking at all of our cut scenes

381
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:09,428
and look at the ones that are farthest along

382
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:13,379
and seeing if there's like three that 
can be polished or chunks of them.

383
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:17,175
Like things that are dramatic, like 
the girl falling through the sky or you know,

384
00:19:17,175 --> 00:19:19,358
things that we already have done somewhat.

385
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,397
I mean, I'm not against having shots 
where we show environments.

386
00:19:22,397 --> 00:19:23,257
Like pan of our environments.

387
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,680
Just if it's only that, that's an obvious like,

388
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,694
maybe just 'cause I'm in the games
 industry, you know what that trailer is.

389
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,940
It's like we don't got nothing.

390
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,873
Schafer: It's not yet a solved problem.

391
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,786
Like how to make people excited about adventure games.

392
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:40,006
So I can't tell you right now.

393
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,759
Rice: I think we should have 
Majus animatic it up, too,

394
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,859
just to see how long, 
Schafer: Animatic it up?

395
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,157
Rice: how long we're looking already.

396
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,607
Schafer: That's the first time 
I've heard that used as verb.

397
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,337
Rice: Animatic it up? 
Schafer: Yeah.

398
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,320
Petty: Here, I'll put some notes 
together and we can send it to Majus.

399
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
[Skype rings]

400
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,020
Fietzek: Hello. 
Offscreen Voice: Hi, Majus.

401
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,940
Fietzek: So I really wanted to continue
 working in the Reds family.

402
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:15,000
and so I talked with Greg and talked 
to Tim and it worked out, which is cool.

403
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:21,385
But it's boring, of course.

404
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,010
It's not as exciting as an office, of course.

405
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:31,390
Because in the office, it's so much
 excitement, pitching something to Tim.

406
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:38,356
And here it's, you know, like I'm 
sending it out and then I have to wait.

407
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,975
And then there's an email and emails 
are great and lovely and all but

408
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:49,271
I really miss, of course, the office and all.

409
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,597
Now I started working on 
the actual teaser trailer.

410
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,040
But I just started.

411
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,180
And I sent it to Tim and I wonder what he thinks.

412
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,160
Schafer: This is Majus' animatic.

413
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:40,720
[Music]

414
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,380
Offscreen Voice: How do you like the trailer?

415
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,506
Schafer: I think it's going to be great.

416
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,780
It's, I mean, it's short but it's a teaser.

417
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,289
Rice: So, it's looking rad.

418
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:51,749
I think it's almost exactly what 
we're hoping for, so that's rad.

419
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,100
Oh my goodness.

420
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,500
This is the worst.

421
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,840
He had to go back to Germany.

422
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,008
Gardner: Basically the first thing that I'm doing

423
00:22:10,008 --> 00:22:15,008
when I do the layout for one of our, 
for any sequence, is I'll play it.

424
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:16,978
And I'll be like, OK, so that,

425
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,940
I'm going to use that background 
for the Cloud Colony, that animation.

426
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,236
I'm going to use that background 
from the hole sequence,

427
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,475
I'm going to use a floating animation.

428
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,337
That, I don't know how we're going 
to do but I'm going to figure that out later.

429
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,129
This one, I know Ray is animating so 
I'll just, as soon as he's done,

430
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:33,029
I'll just throw in his animation.

431
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:37,489
Crook: So that's one of the shots that's 
in the, it's going to be in the trailer.

432
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,229
So we'll be able to take 
the work that I've been doing,

433
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,718
which is all game play stuff.

434
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,640
And we'll just do a slight custom 
version of it to match up with the animatic.

435
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,336
'Cause sometimes, you know, 
Majus will do the animatic

436
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:56,812
and it just isn't the way that it 
plays out exactly in the game.

437
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,120
And so we'll just customize it a little bit.

438
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,280
So some of it might get thrown out, 
but most of the art I think we could keep.

439
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,955
So it won't be a total, like 
waste, in that sense.

440
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,892
So that's usually the trailers 
work, right in there,

441
00:23:11,124 --> 00:23:17,084
you're trying to create an 
overview of the game,

442
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,440
even though a lot of it's not 
even done or even started on.

443
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,838
Offscreen Voice: So Eliot's on 
the team for a little while.

444
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,940
[Applause]

445
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,391
Roberts: I've been secretly working 
on the trailer for the past week.

446
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,720
Offscreen Voice: Commercial?

447
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,381
Crook: That's what you were talking 
about, this is what you wanted.

448
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:41,479
The girl to be thinking during this.

449
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,690
Schafer: It's like, yes, she's apprehensive.

450
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,490
She's like is this really the 
right thing for me to be doing?

451
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,030
Everyone's so happy but I'm like, 
Rice: I think it's good.

452
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,132
Crook: Is the head scratch too obvious or not?

453
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,076
Schafer: No, I mean, if anything, 
it's a little, I mean, I guess,

454
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,042
I was only worried about 
reading as a head scratch

455
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:56,954
and not a finger in the eye, but.

456
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,320
Roberts: And Tim's vision, that, that always helps

457
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,046
because he, he knows his characters so well.

458
00:24:02,046 --> 00:24:05,091
Where like working on effects, 
you work with some directors

459
00:24:05,091 --> 00:24:09,439
that have no idea how to interpret animation,

460
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:13,879
so you show them a shot and they're 
just like, they give you some random note

461
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,035
and they're just like, I, I don't really 
know what to say about this note,

462
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,551
because I don't know what I'm looking at.

463
00:24:18,551 --> 00:24:23,016
I'm not looking at a finished product 
and I know what my character should be doing,

464
00:24:23,016 --> 00:24:24,624
but I don't know how to express that.

465
00:24:24,624 --> 00:24:27,444
And it's surprising how many 
directors out there are like that.

466
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,478
But Tim is different because he, 
he knows his characters so well.

467
00:24:32,773 --> 00:24:37,393
And he would give notes sometimes 
that I'd, I remember going into Brutal

468
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,327
and getting a note and thinking 
like, that's crazy.

469
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,891
I don't think that note's going to work.

470
00:24:42,003 --> 00:24:45,368
Like that, like Eddie shouldn't 
be doing what, with that.

471
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:47,201
And so I, but you know, 
you have to go animate it.

472
00:24:47,201 --> 00:24:50,617
So I went and animated it 
and it totally worked.

473
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:53,995
It was just like totally looked good 
for what Eddie Riggs was doing,

474
00:24:53,995 --> 00:24:56,735
because he knows his characters that well.

475
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:58,577
And it's a really awesome thing.

476
00:24:58,577 --> 00:24:59,237
It's really rare.

477
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,680
Schafer: Thank you, Elliot.

478
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,120
I'll come back in tomorrow and change everything.

479
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,440
Schafer: So much pressure walking 
down the hallway, 'cause of the camera.

480
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,620
Yeah, out of here, JP, get. Go.

481
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,460
LeBreton: But I'm taking this file cabinet
 and these bananas with me.

482
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,543
Schafer: It's like "The Jerk"

483
00:25:26,543 --> 00:25:28,183
You're like Steve Martin.

484
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,781
Get out of here ack mac.

485
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:31,861
Off of Red's with you.

486
00:25:32,806 --> 00:25:34,806
Rice: Yeah, we lost JP.

487
00:25:34,806 --> 00:25:37,907
And he had to go to another project.

488
00:25:38,157 --> 00:25:40,274
Offscreen Voice: Do you feel like you got to make any contributions to the game?

489
00:25:40,274 --> 00:25:41,354
Were you there long enough?

490
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,745
LeBreton: To Red's?

491
00:25:43,182 --> 00:25:46,172
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, yeah.

492
00:25:46,172 --> 00:25:49,025
Just, you know, in a small, you know, yeah.

493
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:51,788
It might be slight, you know, 
in the grand scheme of things,

494
00:25:51,788 --> 00:25:53,888
'cause like, you know, there's still 
a bunch of game to make.

495
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,240
But yeah, I feel like I got to be 
involved and got to know the team,

496
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,260
the specific team culture.

497
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,991
Offscreen Voice: Brandon had to leave, too.

498
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,000
Schafer: Brandon had another 
project that needed him and he's going onto that.

499
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,775
Schafer: I'm out tomorrow 
so this is our last dailies with you.

500
00:26:15,338 --> 00:26:17,398
Good having you.

501
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,263
Dillon: Yeah, this is actually 
the second game at Double Fine

502
00:26:21,263 --> 00:26:23,683
that I've worked on that 
I've left before it was finished.

503
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,833
So yeah, that's, that's always, 
I think that's where the

504
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,446
melancholy comes from more than anything.

505
00:26:29,446 --> 00:26:30,522
It's just sort of like, you know,

506
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,897
you want to kind of see 
things through to the end,

507
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,562
but my general feeling is 
that I'd like to work on

508
00:26:35,748 --> 00:26:38,268
whatever is the most 
important thing for me to work on.

509
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,630
LeBreton: But I think it goes to show that, you know,

510
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,590
like we're a multi-projects studio 
through and through at this point.

511
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,435
And that, you know, we can't, 
putting all of our eggs into one basket,

512
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,376
even if it is a very high profile basket, that you know,

513
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,253
that a lot of our reputation is riding on, you know.

514
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,806
It's kind of like, well, Red's, 
Red's is definitely the future of the studio,

515
00:26:54,806 --> 00:26:58,128
but all these other things are, 
they're sort of further future,

516
00:26:58,128 --> 00:26:59,960
further into the future at the studio.

517
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,170
'Cause hopefully, you know, yeah, 
what we're obviously all hoping for is that

518
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:09,630
Red's comes out and really 
fulfills the promise of the original Kickstarter.

519
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,903
Because the Kickstarter backlash 
has begun in earnest, you know,

520
00:27:12,903 --> 00:27:16,186
and people are saying like, 
oh, you know, like these guys, you know,

521
00:27:16,186 --> 00:27:20,200
what they have, are they, you know, 
are these, is this team ever going deliver?

522
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,200
Is this team, we haven't even heard 
from this team and whatever.

523
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,563
So I think, you know, the people 
who can make that work,

524
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:31,403
the developers who can make that work
 and the ones who can't are, there's going,

525
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:34,883
those packs are going to break apart 
pretty soon if they haven't already.

526
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,700
So, yeah, so yeah, we'll see.

527
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:49,300
[Music]

528
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,920
Schafer: All right. Red's.

529
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,620
Oh yeah, Red's.

530
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,980
I've got to name that basically 
today or tomorrow, really.

531
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,480
And I mean, names change all the time.

532
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,220
Muir: Top three, top three.

533
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,906
Schafer: No, no.

534
00:28:08,906 --> 00:28:12,106
Not going to, 
Muir: Bottom three, bottom three.

535
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,566
Schafer: We're working on it.

536
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,126
Top people are working on it right now.

537
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,120
We also recorded live music this morning.

538
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,072
Brian went and recorded music for the trailer.

539
00:28:21,425 --> 00:28:22,705
That go OK, Brian?

540
00:28:22,705 --> 00:28:24,005
Min: It was nice. 
It was very cool.

541
00:28:25,591 --> 00:28:44,451
[Music]

542
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
McConnell: That was beautiful.

543
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,020
I think that's our take.

544
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,380
[Music]

545
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,900
[Tim Hums along]

546
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,680
[Monster roar]

547
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,420
Schafer: The one that seems a little out of place 
is the monster, Maiden's Feast one,

548
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,040
'cause it seems like it's scored.

549
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,460
Could I hear just that part again?

550
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,820
Min: I mean, it sounds pretty cool to me.

551
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,060
We could certainly bring that 
down if it's a little overpowering.

552
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,491
Schafer: I guess what really jumped out 
is being different than the rest of it,

553
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,940
you know what I mean?

554
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,252
I like the rest of it, but just that first, that first.

555
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,744
Min: Yeah, yeah, we could, 
Schafer: That was crazy.

556
00:29:37,744 --> 00:29:38,709
I love it.

557
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:39,929
Awesome. Do it.

558
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,984
Min: I'll send that out to you 
and then you can check it in your box

559
00:29:42,984 --> 00:29:44,804
and listen to it a few more times.

560
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,280
Min: Thank you, Cam.

561
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,266
Stoddard: I want to make sure I get this right.

562
00:29:52,266 --> 00:29:56,175
So the call of the beast he wants 
up a little and the music down a little,

563
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:56,740
is that right?

564
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,036
Min: No, I think we should just leave it,
 because it sounds awesome.

565
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,680
We'll just bounce out this version 
and then Tim's going to,

566
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,922
he's going to obsess over it anyway.

567
00:30:03,922 --> 00:30:06,502
He's going to just listen to it like five, six times.

568
00:30:06,502 --> 00:30:09,187
And then if it really bothers him, he will tell me.

569
00:30:09,187 --> 00:30:10,707
So I think it's fine.

570
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,222
Camden: The thing I like most about 
this trailer is the dynamics.

571
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,080
The fact that there's quiet and soft parts.

572
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,598
That kind of stuff is rarely seen.

573
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,958
In fact, a lot of times in audio you're 
really tempted to have everything the same.

574
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,729
Like in the same kind of perspective audio-wise.

575
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:37,296
So like that stuff, like it's 
rare to see a game trailer that quiet.

576
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,062
And so I'm really interested 
to see how this is received,

577
00:30:40,062 --> 00:30:44,392
because it's very out of the cut.

578
00:30:44,706 --> 00:30:47,006
So I'm, it's very Tim.

579
00:30:47,006 --> 00:30:51,266
I love how tied in that is, 
because Tim is, like the central theme

580
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:55,012
is like kind of coming into your own 
and breaking out of the routine

581
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,761
and really kind of fighting for your creative soul.

582
00:30:57,761 --> 00:31:00,137
He's like, I got to hand it to Tim.

583
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,289
When he makes a story, like it's in there.

584
00:31:02,617 --> 00:31:03,377
It's deep.

585
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:08,640
And I had a lot of fun, kind of trying 
to find the audio voice of that.

586
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,480
Schafer: It's going to be awesome.

587
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,960
Petty: New music in and you can take a listen

588
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,315
and if there's any last things 
you want, let me know.

589
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,520
Schafer: Cool. Exciting.

590
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,938
Offscreen Voice: It's almost done?

591
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,384
Petty: Yeah. Like anything, you know.

592
00:31:29,384 --> 00:31:33,624
So this is the way games 
or trailers or art develops.

593
00:31:33,624 --> 00:31:38,242
It's like you start here and this is where 
you want to be and you go whoa!

594
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:41,804
And then you go, I'm going to spend 
some undetermined period of time

595
00:31:41,804 --> 00:31:44,686
right here getting this last five to ten percent.

596
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:49,326
So really, yeah, we're in that 
kind of, we're close to that.

597
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:55,680
Ryken: I just saw so many glaring things
 with the textures that I was like, God!

598
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,415
If we're going to work on these guys, 
we're going to do it now for this trailer.

599
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,800
Just get them as close to 
where we want them to be, yeah.

600
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,954
Petty: Levi's gone back and touched up
 some of the, sort of uses it as an excuse

601
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,404
also to go in and tighten up 
some of the earlier paintings.

602
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:12,231
So the girl's actually been 
completely repainted, as has the boy.

603
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,699
But I mean, it's still the 
same design and everything,

604
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,338
but they're just tighter now and 
I think will pop off the background a little bit.

605
00:32:19,653 --> 00:32:22,813
Something that a lot of us 
talked about for a while.

606
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,540
Petty: So the, you know, when we,

607
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,973
I think we have been with this very thin characters.

608
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,040
And I think that makes them, 
of course, harder to read.

609
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,560
And the other thing was the very 
first environment that we chose to polish

610
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,392
has an analogous color scheme 
to the main character in that environment.

611
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,352
Team Member: Yeah.

612
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,820
Petty: A peach-colored thing, but that 
she's also peach and pink.

613
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,440
Roberts: That's where 
it first stood out to me.

614
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,720
Gardner: Yeah well done, Master of Color.

615
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,605
Stapley: I like pink.

616
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:53,617
I like pink. I like pink.

617
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,480
It's your fault.

618
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,880
Gardner: Fuck you!

619
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,700
Stapley: Fuck you man. With your anime shit.

620
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,521
Ryken: I'm excited for this.

621
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:04,494
I think we came a long way 
figuring out the potential for what

622
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,297
all of our scenes can look like 
with the trailer. Yeah.

623
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,400
Just finding something we're happy with. Yeah.

624
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,951
Choy: Like for example, this Maiden Feast scene

625
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,711
was one of the very first scenes 
that was kind of put together

626
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:26,551
before the sort of art work flow 
pipeline and tools were even like, were even set.

627
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,992
So, so going back to this one 
it was actually like, it was like, whoa,

628
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,620
we've come a long way, 'cause 
it was like organized differently

629
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:40,000
and there was a lot of things that 
could be adapted to like the new workflow.

630
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,346
Stapley: In a way, it seems like we're kind
 of grabbing from this point, you know,

631
00:33:44,346 --> 00:33:46,626
and this point and this point 
and this is where we are now.

632
00:33:47,073 --> 00:33:49,813
But I mean, like where we are now, it's awesome.

633
00:33:49,813 --> 00:33:51,918
The trailer looks fucking sick.

634
00:33:51,918 --> 00:33:53,521
I think everything's awesome.

635
00:33:53,521 --> 00:33:56,181
So yeah, I'm more stoked on this system.

636
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:59,092
Offscreen Voice: It seems more like 
what Tim envisioned.

637
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,720
Stapley: Yeah, I hope so, I hope so.

638
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:06,004
Stapley: If everything with the game
could look like that final shot then,

639
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:07,884
people are going to shit, yeah.

640
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,184
Schafer: Yeah. Seeing some of the final stuff,

641
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:13,246
like that final piece of key art 
when Bagel drew it, it was beautiful

642
00:34:13,246 --> 00:34:15,324
and it just made me feel really good about

643
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:17,218
how beautiful the game 
is going to look, you know.

644
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,826
And all the shots in the trailer 
are looking really good,

645
00:34:19,827 --> 00:34:21,192
especially when you see like the key art

646
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,037
and how it looks like the 
original doodle I had in my notebook.

647
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,980
It's like OK, this is exactly what I 
kind of imagined it being from the beginning.

648
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,279
Petty: Logo. It's not there yet.

649
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,020
Schafer: God, what would go there!

650
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,793
The issue is you're always 
waiting for the perfect name

651
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,103
to just pop into your head and 
it was just time to like, like we got to do it.

652
00:34:51,103 --> 00:34:52,585
'Cause in some ways it's kind of silly,

653
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:57,317
'cause names don't matter in 
some way as much people think.

654
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,660
Like as much as you think 
in the moment when you're trying to

655
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,160
come up with the perfect name, 
you're like, oh, that's not perfect.

656
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,600
Schafer: Today's the day when 
the name is due in the game.

657
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,040
Ah, do you want to see my newest charts?

658
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,548
So this is just the latest one.

659
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,760
It started here.

660
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,807
I'm getting into four columns, 
I don't waste paper.

661
00:35:21,137 --> 00:35:22,337
Here' another one.

662
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,880
And that, and that.

663
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,160
I can't delay it anymore, I wish I could.

664
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,680
I wonder if I can get away with delaying it?

665
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,440
That Game Informer guy will be really mad.

666
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:42,548
So will Greg, because it's
dumb to put it in the trailer

667
00:35:42,548 --> 00:35:44,768
and announce the game with a code name.

668
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,249
Ah, I should pick something.

669
00:35:47,249 --> 00:35:48,830
What's the least offensive one?

670
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,980
Probably Broken Age.

671
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,980
Schafer: So try on this name, Broken Age.

672
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,835
Well, we're announcing with the game Broken Age.

673
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,140
And I think, I think it's a good name.

674
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,025
It stands for the broken era 
in which these kids live

675
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:10,909
and their awkward age that they live in.

676
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:13,111
And how they're breaking out of these cycles.

677
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,702
So I think it's definitely an appropriate name.

678
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:17,881
And it's really hard to tell if it, like if it,

679
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:20,448
'cause it's always going to feel a 
little weird to change names like this.

680
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,100
And so I'm saying we just 
put it on and walk around with it.

681
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,051
And learn to love it.

682
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,762
And if we learn to hate it, we'll just change it.

683
00:36:29,762 --> 00:36:32,062
We've changed names before and no problems.

684
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,697
No big deal.

685
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,396
But I think it's a very promising name 
that in two months

686
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,620
we'll either head over heels in love 
with it or we'll have a different name.

687
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,940
So, so that's the name of the game.

688
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,411
Stapley: You guys like the name? Yeah, yeah.

689
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,869
Yeah, we were talking about it yesterday.

690
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:53,749
I was like, I remember when 
we thought that the name Red's was weird.

691
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,274
The nickname was weird.

692
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,041
We're like Red's? But now it's Red's.

693
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,401
Like, we didn't think about it.

694
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:02,441
So that's probably going to be the same thing, maybe.

695
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,580
Petty: Going back through all the scenes
 that we made some advancements

696
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:12,146
in for the trailer and pulling 
in some of those changes.

697
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,126
Then I'm off to GDC.

698
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,460
Schafer: Hey, Scott Campbell!

699
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,440
Oh it's his dad too.

700
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,320
That's awesome.

701
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,640
One second. Hey, Scott's dad.

702
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,040
Schafer: Hi, have you been here before?

703
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,960
Scott's Dad: Oh, I sure have.

704
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,920
Schafer: Welcome back. 
You've been here many times.

705
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,239
Scott's Dad: Soon after you moved, first moved in.

706
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,580
Schafer: Oh my gosh.

707
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,080
Hey. What are doing?

708
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,140
What are you guys doing?

709
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,420
Campbell: So hey, is this for you, 
it's for Molly, right?

710
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:51,900
All right, Molly.

711
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,720
Schafer: So yeah, yeah.

712
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,260
I don't know what else to say, this has 
been the month of just doing too many things.

713
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,840
Being really overloaded with stuff.

714
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:08,208
Hopefully next month will be, well, 
I can focus on design and writting stuff

715
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:11,088
instead of all these extracurricular activities.

716
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,840
Schafer: Tonight's winners, tonight's winners were chosen in an open nomination

717
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,420
process by 700 of the world's top game creators.

718
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,978
Afterwards I hope the team is all 
excited because it's our trailer being cheered

719
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,555
at for the first time and 
everyone's going to be jazzed

720
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,740
so we'll all go out to dinner, hopefully.

721
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,869
And celebrate.

722
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,920
And that should be really a lot of fun.

723
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,194
Unless people boo.

724
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,096
If people boo at the trailer 
then we'll probably be

725
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,480
drinking a lot more than eating.

726
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,311
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen.

727
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,418
We are pleased to begin 
the second half of our evening

728
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:28,110
and welcome you to the thirteenth annual
Game Developers Choice Awards.

729
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,449
Please welcome the host of the evening,

730
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:35,389
President and CEO of Double Fine Productions, 
Tim Schafer.

731
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:42,160
[Applause]

732
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,720
Schafer: Hello, everybody. Hi.

733
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,148
Wow. This podium is…

734
00:39:49,148 --> 00:39:50,191
Schafer: It's great. I mean, it's so weird.

735
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,381
It's so different than any other video 
or anything they're going to show tonight.

736
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:58,564
You either have goofy mega-64 videos, you have these amazing triple "A" crazy games

737
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:03,604
and then you have this little hand painted
 Bagel thing coming out there.

738
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:10,176
I think people will like it. Who knows.

739
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,176
Schafer: I'm not sure if you heard about this,

740
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,060
but a little while back we did a Kickstarter project.

741
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,240
A game and a documentary.

742
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,371
And we usually, we just keep this stuff 
just for our backers.

743
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,773
By the way, is there, are there backers 
here in the audience tonight?

744
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,800
Any backers? Yes!

745
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,645
Please raise your hand if you're a backer.

746
00:40:27,645 --> 00:40:29,562
Thank you backing and 
now please put your hand

747
00:40:29,562 --> 00:40:32,602
in front of the eyes of the 
non-backers seated next to you.

748
00:40:32,602 --> 00:40:35,242
For what we're about to show, please enjoy.

749
00:40:36,431 --> 00:41:32,911
[Music]

750
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:42,250
[Cheering and Applause]

751
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,482
Schafer: Did you see the trailer?

752
00:41:45,482 --> 00:41:46,543
What'd you think of the trailer?

753
00:41:46,543 --> 00:41:47,441
Looked good, huh?

754
00:41:47,441 --> 00:41:48,795
It's great to have this huge payoff,

755
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,621
like you don't really often get to crunch in games

756
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:55,301
and make something and then 
hear people cheer for it, so that was great.

757
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,627
We're going to go to Fang, 
I think, and all have dinner together.

758
00:41:59,627 --> 00:42:01,787
And then see where the evening takes us.

759
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,134
Right? Right? We're going?

760
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:05,949
Rice: Yeah, we gotta go.

761
00:42:05,949 --> 00:42:07,149
Schafer: Let's go right now. OK, bye.

762
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,389
Wait, I got to find my wife, hold on..

763
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:38,960
