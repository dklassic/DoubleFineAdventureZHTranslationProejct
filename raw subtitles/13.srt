1
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,480
Rice: Whoa!

2
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,460
You must have just been off it?

3
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,460
Remember how buggy 
all of this used to be?

4
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,300
Those were the days.

5
00:00:43,180 --> 00:01:06,080
[Music]

6
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,549
Schafer: And Act One of our game 
is now Alpha, which is exciting.

7
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,700
And, whoo!

8
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,910
And Nathan "Bagel" Stapley is 
here in town for two weeks.

9
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,910
There he is, Mr. Stapley, Bagel Stapley.

10
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,900
They recognize you by your hats.

11
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,916
Stapley: Thank you very much.

12
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,482
Schafer: Yeah. No one can still 
pull off trucker hats except for you.

13
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,540
It's awesome. And wait, why are 
you here, Bagel? To paint?

14
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,765
Stapley: Oh, yeah. Talk about Beta.

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
Schafer: Beta. 
Stapley: Polishing and Beta-ing.

16
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,719
Schafer: Awesome. And we, yeah, 
we finished our last one week sprint,

17
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,419
which was finish up Act One 
as far as Alpha-ing goes.

18
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,200
And then we're starting on 
some final polish for some things in Beta.

19
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,720
But it's looking good.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,246
Gardner: And the family 
starts getting a little nervous.

21
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,800
And then we have this 
like big dramatic like...

22
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,027
Lee: Dave you were 
saying to me earlier

23
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:19,518
you think we needed a separate 
scene for that little shot there?

24
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,089
Gardner: This background, yeah.

25
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:21,906
That's a separate.

26
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:23,526
And I have a spot in mind for you to put that.

27
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:24,881
Schafer: Holy shit!

28
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:26,022
Gardner: So here's her,

29
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:29,282
there'd be like a shadow coming 
over her and she's starting to get scared.

30
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,162
Now like I think what would be really 
cool is like for that sequence to kind of be quiet.

31
00:02:34,162 --> 00:02:38,546
And then when we cut to her, she 
gets excited and the crowd is like, whoa!

32
00:02:38,546 --> 00:02:39,666
Like it's Mog Chothra!

33
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,013
So like, and we'd cut to like the threshing ocean

34
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,611
and like the dripping and the effects 
are all totally going crazy here.

35
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,638
Schafer: Blue whale falls off of it 
Gardner: And the crowd is just like totally,

36
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,380
there's going to be the laser eye 
goes bshhhh, and like shines on her.

37
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,617
And that'll be a pulsating laser shot.

38
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,446
And she starts kind of like going ooh,

39
00:02:57,446 --> 00:02:59,700
like I like the way it's dancing off my skin,

40
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,877
the color, you know, like she starts 
getting really excited about it.

41
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,100
Like, and then we do the shot 
where the tentacle comes in.

42
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,910
That's a little long; I'll 
cut that down and then smash!

43
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,039
What do you think if I did, 
look, here he is, without the,

44
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,509
without her even being onscreen.

45
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:14,189
It could be cool.

46
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:16,409
Schafer: We could even start with 
her and like cut to that during the line.

47
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,220
Here could be like, look, he's 
so majestic, even more than we were told.

48
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,180
Gardner: Yeah, that's perfect.

49
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,440
Schafer: People clapping over there.
Gardner: Awesome.

50
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,768
Schafer: And this scene 
where nothing is happening...

51
00:03:24,768 --> 00:03:26,858
Gardner: This is the one where 
the laser is shooting at her.

52
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,830
So actually this one would 
be cool if the laser's on her...

53
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,636
Schafer: But it could be,

54
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,546
that could be when these 
two other maidens are saying this.

55
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,284
Like she's already said, see, 
he's drawn to this flame like a giant moth.

56
00:03:35,284 --> 00:03:38,079
And you could have this moment 
of suspense before he eats her,

57
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,440
where they're saying, 
offscreen, kind of quieter.

58
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,602
Wait, no way. Please, no.

59
00:03:41,602 --> 00:03:42,971
He's going to eat me.

60
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,480
Gardner: Yeah.

61
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,726
Schafer: And the team is kind of working on

62
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,346
finalizing the first half to get that to go out.

63
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,117
And so I'm kind of in 
this mode of a little, it's panic

64
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,431
but it's in a good way because 
you see the clear delineation

65
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,880
of how much more time you have.

66
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,268
And that's all you get to work on

67
00:03:59,268 --> 00:04:01,088
and it'll be taken out of 
your hands when it's done.

68
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,879
So you really have to prioritize 
when you look at everything,

69
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,520
'cause you could, you could 
mess with everything in the game

70
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,370
and just dink around with it 
and polish it and do all this stuff.

71
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,060
But if you can only do like out 
of the 50 things you could think of doing,

72
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,200
you only can do ten of them, then you're like OK,

73
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,480
I got to fix the ten most important things to do.

74
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,750
And that's nice in the way that it gets you to

75
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,907
really focus on what's important about the game.

76
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,234
So I'm in that mode of like thinking,

77
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,900
if I can only do ten more things 
to make the game great, what can I do?

78
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,580
Petty: I think we're going to 
repaint those maidens' faces anyways,

79
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,420
but you know, at this point if Bagel

80
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,556
and I were to list all the 
things we want to repaint,

81
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,820
it'd be the entire game, every 
character and we obviously can't do that.

82
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,237
So if like there's one that's featured
prominently like that candle maiden,

83
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,508
then we should for sure hit it.

84
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,246
But if we're not going to cut in 
close to the rose maiden,

85
00:04:37,246 --> 00:04:38,266
then I don't, probably don't want to touch it.

86
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:42,089
At least it'll be lower in priority. 
Schafer: Cool? Exciting.

87
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,201
Petty: It's cool.

88
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:44,785
I think it's really going to 
help to get that thing in there

89
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,305
and get all those little bits polished.

90
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,480
It should really hopefully give 
Mog Chothra some actual weight.

91
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,120
Stapley: Thanks, guys.

92
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,360
Gardner: Easy peasy.

93
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,683
Stapley: Yeah, now we're going to like polish,

94
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:07,103
like tons of draw overs and tons 
of notes and tons of things just to change.

95
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:08,083
And yeah.

96
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,300
Like all the art's in there.

97
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,140
And now we just have to like push it 
and pull it to make it more awesome.

98
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,153
Stapley: Is it weird having him in the middle,

99
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,848
is it bad for the game play to kind of 
like have him in the middle of the scene?

100
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:22,424
Petty: He's off to the side, what do you mean?

101
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:25,544
Stapley: I mean like, I don't know, 
it is just because of this,

102
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,000
I mean it's like I'm looking over here all the time.

103
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,476
I mean, I know we could put 
this foreground shit in there,

104
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,260
but it'd still be like, errr.

105
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,640
Like if he was just taking up the whole screen...

106
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,604
Petty: I don't think that would look so good.

107
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,884
You're going to be staring at 
like no depth or fidelity.

108
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,353
Stapley: Yeah, I kind of like that, I don't know.

109
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,920
Stapley: Oh yeah, totally, totally.

110
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,180
I think there's a thing with, just consistency.

111
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,106
Making it look like it's a 
cohesive piece, you know.

112
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:56,837
There's a lot of things that 
you can tell who painted what and

113
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,864
I don't know I'm bothered by that, 
or if anybody cares about that,

114
00:06:01,864 --> 00:06:06,581
but yeah, that's one thing that 
I want us to put like, see.

115
00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:08,821
Stapley: Also that egg is fucking huge over there.

116
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,280
Schafer: This one?

117
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,717
Petty: You don't like variation of egg size?

118
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,641
Stapley: I do like it.

119
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:14,255
I like variation. I like variation.

120
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,215
Schafer: No, no, no.

121
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,630
But does it, but is it jumped out?

122
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,600
Petty: So there's a small bird with 
an extremely large egg-laying area.

123
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,940
Stapley: A huge butt.

124
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,515
Schafer: Say it. Cloaca.

125
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:26,380
Petty: Cloaca.

126
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,440
Petty: I was trying to get Tim to say it first.

127
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,380
Schafer: Massive Cloaca was 
the original name of Brad's game.

128
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,329
Stapley: Cloaca? Is that what 
eggs come out of birds?

129
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:33,867
Schafer: That's the uni-hole.

130
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,740
Petty: It's the uni-hole.

131
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,660
It's there for procreation and defecation.

132
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,935
Stapley: Oh my God, that's crazy.

133
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,022
Petty: I don't think I've ever worked with an artist

134
00:06:40,022 --> 00:06:44,242
who wouldn't spend infinite time 
polishing the smallest detail

135
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:46,578
if everything else being equal, you know.

136
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,344
So there's like just artist 
tendencies to want to do that.

137
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:50,931
And you have to do a certain amount of it

138
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,520
for the game to be meaningful 
and be beautiful.

139
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,340
But then you also have to keep in mind 
all the other things that we have to do,

140
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,970
you know, playability and just 
what the overall experience is like.

141
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,973
And that can be difficult to keep 
your eye on towards the end of a project

142
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,260
because your head's down, trying 
to go through all your lists of stuff.

143
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,900
But you have to kind of look around you, too,

144
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,480
to make sure you're not just polishing 
a corner that no one cares about.

145
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,319
Petty: If you had to pick 
one scene that is visually,

146
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,832
you think overall works the best 
and maybe one that works that least.

147
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,760
I just want to get a, 
Rice: Shellmound's my favorite and I think Meriloft,

148
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,260
the main is my least favorite.

149
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,732
Petty: Yeah, I think my least favorite 
is the Cloud Colony main as well.

150
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,060
I would agree with you guys.

151
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,282
Petty: It's kind of a tricky scene to kind of balance,

152
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,141
but that's what we're going to 
try and do without changing it too much,

153
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:32,861
just because there's a 
lot of stuff hooked up.

154
00:07:32,861 --> 00:07:34,772
Stapley: It's definitely spotty 
right now, spotty as shit.

155
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,897
Petty: Yeah. There's four exits 
and three focal points.

156
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,878
It's kind of an overloaded scene 
from that standpoint.

157
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,718
Stapley: And that big hole's super-distracting.

158
00:07:44,025 --> 00:07:46,746
Schafer: It's also weird how solid 
the cloud looks right there.

159
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:47,926
This little horseshoe.

160
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,140
Petty: But yeah, that's what 
we're going to try and solve.

161
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,040
Stapley: Yeah. This is like the original one.

162
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,972
And you see this big thing right here?

163
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,660
I don't know what that is.

164
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,020
I don't know why I put it in there.

165
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,268
I have this thing that's like kissing 
the edge of this frame, which is also weird.

166
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:06,748
It takes your eye over and 
you don't want anybody

167
00:08:06,748 --> 00:08:08,785
to be looking at the very corner of the page.

168
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:11,845
All this contrast, is basically just
showing off this shape,

169
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,114
which is like not really that important.

170
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,420
I think the important thing is really kind of right here.

171
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,711
So we're like experimenting with it.

172
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,523
I don't know if this is totally there yet.

173
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:22,043
It seems a little dark down here.

174
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:28,876
But just playing around more with like a
better composition-type kind of like,

175
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,100
so your eye goes to the places that we want it to go.

176
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,080
Petty: It's just like anything.

177
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,806
You can have like a painting 
and it's all about focal points

178
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,206
and where you're drawing the eyes.

179
00:08:36,206 --> 00:08:38,093
So you can have a beautiful 
corner, but if that's not,

180
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,702
the painting's not about that corner

181
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:42,741
then it's actually more of a distraction 
even though it's executed really nicely.

182
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:43,965
And games are the same way, right.

183
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:46,586
There's all these different elements 
and you don't really ever see it

184
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:50,384
fully put together and understand 
how it all flows until the end.

185
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,193
Because then that's the only time 
you have all the information,

186
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,260
or at least more of it, about 
where the emphasis should be put.

187
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,608
Schafer: But we planned out things,

188
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:00,632
I mean, we've already polished a lot of the spaceship

189
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,888
and we're starting to polish Vella's world a lot,

190
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:05,325
so I actually feel really good in that

191
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:07,077
we've already done a lot of polish on the game.

192
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,234
It's not like you'd play the game, 
it doesn't seem like a wreck

193
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,280
and oh my God, how are we 
going to pull this thing together.

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,720
I mean, I definitely see the art 
getting more and more polished.

195
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,020
It's just hard to look at it 
and see if the game is fun

196
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,240
and making sure that that 
fun is getting more and more fun.

197
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,486
That can only be found out by play-testing.

198
00:09:22,486 --> 00:09:26,483
Rice: And so Tim and I and a couple 
people have doing a lot of play-testing

199
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:30,349
with people now finally actually 
sitting down and playing the whole game,

200
00:09:30,349 --> 00:09:34,060
which has been super exciting 
and super informative.

201
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,340
We've been making a lot of new 
bugs and tasks and things out of that.

202
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,624
But it's just nice to see like 
people being able to like sit down

203
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:44,465
and actually just play the game 
as if it was the final game, you know.

204
00:09:44,465 --> 00:09:46,020
You can actually like start from the beginning

205
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,650
and you have the actual 
whole like start sequence.

206
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,730
You can switch between the 
characters, you can play all the way

207
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,290
through those stories up to 
the part that we're shipping in January.

208
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,290
Kipnis: Yay congratulations!

209
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,380
Rice: You did it!

210
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,862
Schafer: I've never watched any 
of our adventure games be played

211
00:10:02,862 --> 00:10:05,402
in that level of detail, like sat 
behind someone and watched them play.

212
00:10:05,402 --> 00:10:07,119
In the old days we would have one pizza orgy,

213
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,280
which was like a big play-test session

214
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,755
with all our friends and relatives 
where they all talk into one big group.

215
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,780
Kind of like that HOF that we did.

216
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,485
But these were actually 
just watching someone.

217
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:19,225
And watching what they 
do with the cursor, like oh,

218
00:10:19,225 --> 00:10:21,139
they put the cursor over the 
right spot but they didn't click.

219
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,517
Why didn't they do that?

220
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,500
And, or they'll, the object 
you want them to touch is here

221
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,560
and they'll go all around the room this way.

222
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,742
And like, what are they doing?

223
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,734
Why are they doing that?

224
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,540
That's so crazy.

225
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,917
And just noticing when 
they're tapping their fingers

226
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,300
and when they're, you know, 
laughing and all that stuff is really fascinating.

227
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,008
Rice: Yeah, we've kind of 
had a little cadence to it,

228
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:42,453
so it just started with people 
internal who are really kind of into,

229
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,840
to adventure games specifically.

230
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,010
Just because they'll be a little more keen

231
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:52,145
to kind of understand what's 
the goal and what they're trying to do.

232
00:10:52,145 --> 00:10:54,905
Remo: I like that the ship design 
is like very interlocking.

233
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,870
Like I still don't go to the like 
most optimum way every time,

234
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,377
because I don't always remember 
where everything goes,

235
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,495
but I feel like I'm starting 
to actually understand the space

236
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,720
and how it's spatially connected, which 
is a really good feeling to have in a game.

237
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,060
Kipnis: So what are you 
trying to get accomplished?

238
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:16,219
Remo: I mean, I, getting out 
of range of the mom arm

239
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,000
when I'm trying to get to the boom arm.

240
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:24,220
And then get the weaver 
to go to the correct location.

241
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,700
Kipnis: What is that for, though?

242
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,620
Remo: Save guys, I don't remember. Sorry.

243
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,720
Yeah, I can't remember offhand.

244
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,132
Rice: Now we kind of started opening 
it up internally to more people

245
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,740
who don't particularly play this kind of a game.

246
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,100
Sullivan: Yeah, I could maybe, 
should come around the side?

247
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,240
Gollaher: How do you do it? Yeah, exactly.

248
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,600
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

249
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,486
Sullivan: I don't see any 
like connection back here.

250
00:11:56,486 --> 00:11:59,546
Gollaher: So there's, yeah, 
but there's a path up there.

251
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,240
I don't know where else to go.

252
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,298
Sullivan: Me, either.

253
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,720
Rice: But now we, after that, we kind of 
had to start moving to people external,

254
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,204
which has been fun, too.

255
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:21,714
Just because even people who 
are internal that aren't on the team,

256
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,577
like you know, they see stuff on people's monitors

257
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,994
or they hear things around the office,

258
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,139
that could like sway the data 
that we're getting from them a little bit.

259
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,412
So it's good to get people 
who are just outside,

260
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,120
know nothing about the game, 
to come in and check it out.

261
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,740
Schafer: Gaijin Games is right across the street

262
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,600
and Mike Roush came over with 
one of his coworkers and tested the game.

263
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,340
Roush: It's pretty immersive.

264
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,860
It freaks me out.

265
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,218
Schafer: What's that?

266
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,720
Roush: It's so immersive.

267
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,000
Like I just, I was, just found 
myself just zoning out in the world.

268
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,120
Schafer: That's acceptable.

269
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,470
Schafer: There's another layer 
of baggage, of course,

270
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,629
when you bring in another developer,

271
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:03,889
'cause you want them to like your game,

272
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:06,609
because you know, and think 
that it's better than their game.

273
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:07,329
That's the main goal.

274
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:10,287
You want them to go away, 
going God, this game is so much better.

275
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,880
Well, I told you my tip.

276
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,740
One of tips I learned is whenever you 
feel like saying the word "jealous",

277
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,160
just say inspired.

278
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,791
And you'll sound like a much 
more positive, healthy person.

279
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,420
So I'm always really inspired when 
I look at other developers' games.

280
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,140
Peck: I've never done that 
much play-testing before.

281
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,200
Just watching someone play 
an adventure game.

282
00:13:29,702 --> 00:13:33,282
It's really, it's really like 
taxing on your concentration

283
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:36,271
to not just be like, ohh, you know, like.

284
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:41,834
There's a lot of, there's a lot of 
down time mentally for the player

285
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,088
when they're just kind of like 
going from one hotspot to another.

286
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:52,410
Yeah, I did an internship at EA 
and that was very different

287
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:58,174
because I was working on like 
this racing game on the Wii

288
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:05,772
and they would do a lot of testing 
kind of either offsite or out of sight from me.

289
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:10,673
I would just like see a report from somebody 
that they'd written up after they had,

290
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,114
you know, I imagine gotten like 
a bunch of teenagers off the street

291
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,191
and paid with pizza to play 
the game for like a couple hours

292
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,880
and they videotaped them

293
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,780
that was, it doesn't really, obviously 
doesn't compare to like actually

294
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,580
sitting on a couch behind someone 
and like watching them play the game.

295
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,560
It's a pretty amazing experience, actually.

296
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,140
It's like watch someone play a section 
of the game that you, that you scripted out.

297
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,540
It's really exciting and frightening 
and you learn a lot.

298
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,120
So yeah.

299
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,820
It's been a pretty positive process, I think.

300
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,500
The game's definitely been better for it.

301
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,140
Roush: It's put a lot of questions into my mind, 
which I think is really awesome,

302
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,168
'cause it's like I kind of 
wasn't trusting mom a little bit

303
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:04,213
and now Marek, now I 
don't know if trust him.

304
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,180
So I kind of feel like I don't know,

305
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,200
it's like I'm playing as an innocent little kid
 and I don't know what's going on.

306
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,560
And you know, in the first hour 
I feel very connected to him.

307
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,280
So that's, I think that's really huge,

308
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,020
'cause I want to be connected 
to my character in a video game.

309
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,660
The part with the train and the avalanche,

310
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,600
I did kind of feel, that was 
like the hardest for me.

311
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,860
I was kind of starting to lose 
a little bit of interest, whereas this,

312
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:41,380
I'm just like, I want to fucking go 
to the next place and see what's going on.

313
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,484
Schafer: That's the toughest,

314
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,544
that's the toughest one because in my head I was like,

315
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:49,658
OK, there'll be this routine for the boy

316
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,028
and he'll be stuck in it and 
the puzzle is to get him out.

317
00:15:52,028 --> 00:15:53,790
So that means if you're 
stuck in it, it's getting repetitive

318
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,970
and if you want to get out, that 
means it has to be kind of frustrating.

319
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,140
And so when people say like I 
found that routine really frustrating

320
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,123
'til I broke out of it, is that bad 
feedback or good feedback?

321
00:16:03,123 --> 00:16:05,886
Because it's almost exactly the 
way I'd described I wanted it to feel.

322
00:16:05,886 --> 00:16:07,426
But when someone actually 
says it to your face, ooh,

323
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,360
it's really frustrating, that part.

324
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,260
Like you don't want someone 
to feel frustrated with your game,

325
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,980
but that is what you were going for.

326
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,479
Rice: I do think it was pretty good.

327
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,047
It was one of the better, I think 
the thing we still need to talk about,

328
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:23,564
though, is like what happens if 
they wouldn't have gotten out there.

329
00:16:23,564 --> 00:16:26,544
If we have any plan for long, long term stuff.

330
00:16:26,544 --> 00:16:28,384
Schafer: We could do, yeah, that's the thing, now we could add a failsafe

331
00:16:28,384 --> 00:16:31,324
for like pick whatever we think 
is too many missions to go for.

332
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,458
Rice: Yeah. Like I wouldn't have wanted to go

333
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,320
much further than where they were.

334
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,347
Schafer: So as long as it 
was a good kind of frustration

335
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:38,667
where they knew there was a way out

336
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:39,955
and they just had to figure it out

337
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,580
and then they did figure it out 
and then they felt smart and that's good.

338
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:55,220
[Music]

339
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,000
Schafer: We did all this play-testing

340
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,580
and we took out a bunch of places 
where everyone was getting stuck.

341
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,589
Then I was worried that we 
were making it too easy,

342
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:04,231
so we went back in and took out 
some of the hints that we put in.

343
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,660
And now we can test it again and 
make sure we didn't make it too hard again.

344
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,207
So it's kind of a back and forth thing.

345
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,405
But it had me thinking about Act Two.

346
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:13,925
That Act Two definitely has 
to be harder than Act One,

347
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,880
that only makes sense, right?

348
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,800
Your player is more advanced now 
and you're used to like these kind of puzzles.

349
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,922
We had to kind of step up 
the complexity of all the puzzles.

350
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:24,540
And I was thinking it was too simple.

351
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,200
So I'm looking at the chart again.

352
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,700
Nice chart, huh?

353
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,700
Two colors.

354
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,389
Offscreen Voice: That's Act Two.

355
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,540
Schafer: That's Act Two in a nutshell.

356
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,800
And that final picture at the bottom, 
looks like two testicles?

357
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,660
That's actually the climactic 
scene of the game.

358
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,820
There I sketched out the first shot of 
the game, that's the last shot of the game.

359
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,839
I just want to make all my changes 
to the second half that I'm going to make now,

360
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,496
'cause to make them really work, 
some of them might have to be pre-,

361
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,900
like set up in the First Act.

362
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,960
So they don't just appear out 
of nowhere in the second Act.

363
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,324
Things are going good.

364
00:18:03,324 --> 00:18:05,524
I mean, this January thing is real.

365
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,886
When we first split the game I was like,

366
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:12,414
we'll just say we're splitting 
the game to make Justin happy, you know.

367
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,240
But we really will find a way to just 
not have to split the game later.

368
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,407
But as the more, the closer we got,

369
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:21,167
they were like, well, I think we 
really have to do it, so we...

370
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,387
We're definitely splitting it.

371
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:31,180
[Music]

372
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
Min: All right, let's do this.
Stoddard: So moving on,

373
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,320
I'm going to give you guys 
kind of a broad view of the game.

374
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,420
We're going to kind of skip 
around the scenes and stuff.

375
00:18:51,970 --> 00:19:01,523
[squeaking, sci-fi sound fx]

376
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:02,224
Stoddard: All right.

377
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,580
This is the hillside.

378
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,120
Min: This just looks amazing.

379
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,060
Correia: I love this right here. 
Min: Yeah.

380
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,948
I could be here for an hour.

381
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,741
Min: Yeah, it just looks amazing.

382
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,652
Correia: And I actually dig the music.

383
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,000
To me, it has a Zelda vibe to it.

384
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,740
I don't know.

385
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,433
Min: That's a good thing, I assume.

386
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,020
Correia: To me, it's a great thing.

387
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,220
Min: I'm glad it passes your test.

388
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,956
Honest, it's fantastic.

389
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,160
Everything sounds great.

390
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,104
I did hear like discrepancies 
in terms of volume.

391
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,580
So obviously we have mixing issues,

392
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,920
where like the wolf was 
way, much louder than Shay.

393
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,964
Correia: I just think all the 
dialogue in the game is too loud.

394
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,750
Min: I'm not worried about the loudness

395
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:39,463
as much as the relative volume 
of the dialogue with other dialogue.

396
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,360
Correia: Yeah, yeah. Relatively, yeah.

397
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:42,421
Min: So it's like, yeah...

398
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:44,321
O'Rourke: I noticed like a few 
lines, it's not like overall.

399
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:46,731
Min: Yeah. And that's probably 
just a general task

400
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,189
once everything is done, 
you know, that we spend, I'd say,

401
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:55,348
a few weeks even to get basically, 
you know, nuance each one of those lines.

402
00:19:55,348 --> 00:19:58,355
Because again, that's the star 
of our game, is the dialogue.

403
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,328
Correia: But the dialogue's 
everywhere, stepping over everything

404
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:03,480
so like you could have 
great sound designed,

405
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,213
but it seems like half 
of it's getting cut out,

406
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,881
just 'cause of the 
ducking and the dialogue.

407
00:20:06,881 --> 00:20:08,406
Stoddard: The ducking's very sensitive.

408
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:09,245
Correia: Ducking's aggressive.

409
00:20:09,245 --> 00:20:10,656
There's dialogue over everything

410
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,878
and so the sound aside everything 
else has to kind of sit with it.

411
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,021
O'Rourke: I think that's kind of like a compromise 
we make in an adventure game.

412
00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:18,469
That little bit 
Correia: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

413
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:22,227
So with that like slider, 
because it's so heavily dialogued,

414
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:24,540
like the dialogue has to be perfect over say,

415
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,840
having like the best...

416
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,200
Min: It's definitely going to be challenging.

417
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,011
And this is one of those things, I think 
we can sell to the production team easier.

418
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,700
But from the looks of the way 
the game has gone, it's just,

419
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,500
it feels like it's just demanding 
this triple "A" attention, you know.

420
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:43,378
To us, it's really challenging because 
we just don't have a triple "A" budget.

421
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,441
Stoddard: I'm definitely going to 
be asking for some help from you guys.

422
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,866
Like the reverb template stuff would be huge.

423
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,880
The Foley thing would be enormous.

424
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,141
O'Rourke: I'm in.
Min: Let's get some lunch.

425
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,520
Thanks, man.

426
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,863
This helps a lot.

427
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,004
I've been like going out of my 
mind trying to get this thing...

428
00:20:58,004 --> 00:21:00,379
O'Rourke: And then we just all jump 
into a freeze frame, right, for the end?

429
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,920
Stoddard: Go team!

430
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:19,600
[Heavy stepping sounds]

431
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Min: So we are tracking Foley.

432
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,225
Like I think, I still think it's 
very important that even though

433
00:21:26,225 --> 00:21:30,223
you're very, very limited in your 
budget, it's important to take the time out.

434
00:21:30,377 --> 00:21:31,360
We can't do everything.

435
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,100
We can't do Foley for everything,

436
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,000
but on some of these kinds 
of things that the player hears a lot,

437
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,359
which are footsteps, we try 
to be very specific and custom.

438
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,511
And then I think that's important.

439
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,915
So even if you're super on 
a shoestring budget,

440
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,200
you can see we can do things in some office.

441
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:48,300
Not the best acoustic treatment or whatnot,

442
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,440
but we try to track those things 
organically and I think that has a lot of value.

443
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,140
So yeah.

444
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,946
Stoddard: But yeah, that's, that's been the cool 
thing about working on this game,

445
00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:59,866
is 'cause like it just covers a lot of ground.

446
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,666
There's a lot of stuff going on.

447
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,386
And Pete and I have been 
having discussions about that,

448
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,860
'cause he called me up and he was like, 
you know, I played through the game.

449
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,500
I'm like seeing what Tim's trying to say 
and all the coming of age stuff and he's like,

450
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,396
I don't know what cereal he was eating, 
but this is like insanely good.

451
00:22:19,586 --> 00:22:23,606
And like he's like, I'm going to have to 
go all over the board with music.

452
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,480
McConnell: So here's everything 
we're doing in two sessions.

453
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,880
It looks like a mess, but it's actually, 
here's the cues prioritized.

454
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,680
Here's the amount of time that 
actually the sextet has to record.

455
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,680
And then that's translated into how 
much session time we can afford for each cue.

456
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,280
And hence this.

457
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,320
It's very simple, you're just you know,

458
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,020
playing a couple notes.

459
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,420
We just need to get them, we just 
need to get it all happen.

460
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,214
McConnell: We put down all 
the small ensemble music

461
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,860
for Broken Age on track, on tape.

462
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,840
I always, I still say tape.

463
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,360
I still say records, too.

465
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,014
McConnell: Like this story is so 
wonderful because it's so complex.

466
00:23:21,255 --> 00:23:23,735
It's, you know, it's not just, oh yeah, 
the young people know everything

467
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,560
and the old people screwed 
up the world, you know.

468
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,620
No, it's not, it's not quite like that, is it?

469
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,220
No, the young people don't know everything.

470
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,860
Maybe the, maybe the grownups have 
been through some things, you know.

471
00:23:37,297 --> 00:23:42,517
And yet there may, they've made 
terrible mistakes and I think that,

472
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:50,960
that is really fun to engage musically.

473
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,880
McConnell: I don't know 
much about Part Two.

474
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,380
I've been told things, you know.

475
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,516
I've been told, you know, that 
there's a, I've been told a rundown of it

476
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,760
but honestly, what I've been told 
I don't entirely understand right now.

477
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:09,669
And you know, I think that's, I think that's really good,

478
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,500
because the score is going to discover 
what Part Two is when Part Two happens.

00:24:33,828 --> 00:24:35,568
I think we have that in an earlier take.

McConnell: It's a, it's a real score 
for a real, for a real story.

484
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,240
I think it's, it's kind of a 
labor of love for everybody.

485
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,640
I think it's really, really what it gets down to.

486
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,066
It's this, you know, people get excited
 about, about working on a project

487
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,965
and you know, in this day and age 
the people who you happen to run across,

488
00:24:58,084 --> 00:25:01,184
who get excited about working 
with you and you're able to,

489
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,784
to put something together with them, 
might be on another continent.

[Orchestra warming up]

492
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,600
Pogson: Yeah, so this was, 
this was pretty exciting.

493
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:34,812
I guess the interesting thing about 
the MSO being involved is the fact that

494
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:38,769
I'm actually a Kickstarter backer of the game

495
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:40,989
and I was well before I'd ever spoken to Peter

496
00:25:41,402 --> 00:25:43,942
and well before this project 
came on our radar.

497
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:47,589
Pogson: Really all of Tim's games 
and certainly Peter's scores

498
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:52,529
are pretty much all of my 
favorite games from my childhood.

499
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:59,454
They're games I spent huge numbers 
of hours with my friends playing as little kids.

500
00:25:59,657 --> 00:26:01,777
So much so that things like Day of the Tentacle

501
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:08,000
and certainly later on things like 
The Dig and Grim Fandango

502
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,860
and all of those old 
LucasArts games, we used to act,

503
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,372
when little kids playing around playgrounds,

504
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,034
we used to sort of almost 
act out the puzzles.

505
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:23,063
So for me, those LucasArts 
games are a real nostalgia trip.

506
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,820
And they just really remind me of those,
 those days when we were younger.

507
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:35,132
And then I was watching one of the backer
 videos and saw that Peter was mentioned.

508
00:26:35,282 --> 00:26:36,502
It actually wasn't far before

509
00:26:36,502 --> 00:26:40,680
any of the episodes about 
Peter really being involved.

510
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:42,520
But I thought, oh, wow!

511
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,960
Peter's in this, which makes 
total sense because him and Tim

512
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,749
have worked together for a very long 
time and I hadn't really thought about it.

513
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:50,102
And I sort of thought, you know what?

514
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,800
I wonder if there's an orchestra recording there.

515
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,920
So I had no idea whether they 
were having a proper orchestra do it.

516
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,920
Obviously I had access to an orchestra.

517
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,920

Thanks for being here.

This is for a video game.

519
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,998
We're working with Peter McConnell, 
a composer who's in L.A.

520
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,320
and he's on the line now and 
we'll be talking with him as we go.

521
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,620
Upstairs we've got Hai, Chris and 
Nick and we've got a fair bit to do.

522
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,900
So that's enough talking for now.

523
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:21,220
We're going to start with 
SM03, Shellmound Battle.

Turn back to trombone and tuba 
and move ahead there.

We've just got to go with the one note.

[music slowly builds in intensity]

532
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:54,533
Pogson: I really admire any 
game that puts music, you know,

533
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,314
as a really important element of the game.

534
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,951
There are so many games, even really big budget ones,

535
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,590
and some of the biggest budget ones,

536
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,552
where you can just tell that 
they haven't used real musicians.

537
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:06,411
Yes, they're very high quality samples and so on

538
00:30:06,411 --> 00:30:09,858
and perhaps there are people 
who don't notice the difference.

539
00:30:09,858 --> 00:30:11,438
But I always do.

540
00:30:11,438 --> 00:30:15,118
And I think the really great 
part about this is that,

541
00:30:15,924 --> 00:30:18,516
I'm actually very proud that we're able to bring that,

542
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:24,877
that full orchestra palette and that 
authentic sound to a project like this.

543
00:30:24,877 --> 00:30:31,305
And I think Peter was very, 
very pleased as well because talking to him,

544
00:30:31,305 --> 00:30:35,618
it was always a dream of his to be 
able to use a proper orchestra for this.

545
00:30:35,618 --> 00:30:39,606
And, but didn't think it was 
going to happen and now it has.

546
00:30:39,606 --> 00:30:42,045
And I think it's important to me, as a backer,

547
00:30:42,045 --> 00:30:44,885
as well to have that, that level of quality on there.

548
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:45,685
So it's great.

549
00:30:45,685 --> 00:30:46,665

was done before you guys,

568
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,041
Stoddard: Well, that's what's 
happening with this one.

569
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:18,561
This is for the final scene, which 
I think Elliot's working on right now.

570
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,328
Stoddard: Basically, the symphonic recording,

571
00:32:22,328 --> 00:32:26,851
live instruments and pro voices 
all like happening at the same time,

572
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,560
which is creating quite an amazing bottleneck.

573
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:35,760
But it's also kind of communicating 
with Tim and with production

574
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,624
and with the animators,

575
00:32:36,624 --> 00:32:42,184
because a lot of that stuff is 
still being worked on visually.

576
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:48,369
Crook: I've been doing all the play 
blasts for all of the spaceship cut scenes,

577
00:32:48,477 --> 00:32:50,530
so that we can have a meeting with animators

578
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:54,860
and you and go over what we might want to change

579
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,820
before we move into final animation on those.

Offscreen Voice: My name is Marek.

581
00:33:00,823 --> 00:33:04,183

582
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,920
Schafer: What are those hairs?

583
00:33:12,485 --> 00:33:13,925
Marek: There will always be war.

584
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,505
We did not start it.

585
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,242
Marek: What we can do is protect 
the weak and rescue the helpless.

586
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,502
Schafer: I think the animation 
of the wolf is hilarious

587
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,667
and it's great but it's a little out 
of character for Marek.

588
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:30,230
Like Marek is so somber and serious, 
but when he's like putting his arm around him

589
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,770
and like it seems really jovial 
and stuff like that.

590
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:36,655
And Marek is like this, I always 
saw him as more just like super-intense,

591
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,137
brooding, like intimidating 
kind of guy, like that.

592
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,580
Like he's a little too chummy 
in this, especially the beginning of it.

593
00:33:45,938 --> 00:33:48,779
Crook: One, just, tear runs down Dave's cheek.

594
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:50,715
Gardner: I mean, part of it 
is that he's supposed to be

595
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,120
selling the boy on this whole deal,

596
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,532
that's why I was trying to, 
Schafer: But he's not selling him like, like hey buddy.

597
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,135
He's not like Bruce Campbell, 
like he's not, I don't about Bruce Campbell.

598
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,345
But like he's not like,

599
00:34:02,345 --> 00:34:06,362
he doesn't have that kind of charlatan
sounding salesman-y tone to his voice.

600
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:07,795
And it's not, like his character.

601
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,536
He's more just like, 
Gardner: Can I see it again?

602
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:14,320
Schafer: Are you good enough 
for this mission kind of like.

603
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,954
He's got a coldness to him that I think...

604
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,708
Gardner: I really hate to lose all that, like stuff.

605
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,725
'Cause it's just, I don't know, I'm happy with it there.

606
00:34:21,725 --> 00:34:22,780
Schafer: But it's a little too goofy.

607
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,710
I would say overall the whole thing's 
a little too goofy, so I feel like it all,

608
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:28,439
it needs a sombering pass on 
the whole thing, you know, for sure.

609
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,180
Just to make his character correct.

610
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,580
Gardner: I could cut out the 
like arm over the shoulder part.

611
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:37,168
And I think we should cut all this stuff out.

612
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:38,051
Marek: There will always be war.

613
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,562
We did not start it and we cannot stop it.

614
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,508
Gardner: As much as I don't 
want to do that, 'cause it's amazing.

615
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,801
Schafer: I think it's all great, but let's get one thing clear.

616
00:34:45,802 --> 00:34:47,772
I think it all totally needs to be changed.

617
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,975
I do think it's a totally wrong 
take on his character.

618
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,316
That's what I'm saying.

619
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,316
So we, so I don't want to just kind 
of like do a couple tweaks here and there.

620
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,120
I think, we have to understand that he's supposed 
to be cold and calculating and a little scary.

621
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,400
And these make him seem really friendly,

622
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,809
like now you've met your new best 
friend, which he's kind of like not there yet.

623
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:09,209
Like he's not, 
Gardner: I mean, yeah. OK.

624
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,602
Schafer: Were you here that day that 
I had to tell Dave to reanimate that scene?

625
00:35:13,602 --> 00:35:14,764
That was exciting.

626
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,520
Schafer: Oh, good.

627
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,292
That's like one of the worst 
or hardest parts about

628
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,829
doing like a creative collaboration with anyone.

629
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:25,529
You have this great artist and creative
 people from different disciplines

630
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,540
and they'll do something that's 
just amazing and everybody loves it.

631
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,162
And by itself it's a great work of art, 
like that piece of animation

632
00:35:32,162 --> 00:35:34,014
or a piece of music or something.

633
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,030
But then you go like, but that 
doesn't fit into this larger thing.

634
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:40,321
That is wrong for the thing that 
I'm trying to do with this bigger thing.

635
00:35:40,449 --> 00:35:42,423
So take that, all that work 
you did and throw it away.

636
00:35:42,423 --> 00:35:46,523
That's the worst part about it, 
but you kind of have to do that

637
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:48,883
or else you have everything 
going in all different directions.

638
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,149
Schafer: So, sorry.

639
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:53,665
It all was really cool.

640
00:35:53,665 --> 00:35:55,345
I'm just here to take out things people like.

641
00:35:55,345 --> 00:35:57,961
Gardner: It'll, it'll, like we'll have it, 
like I have a movie file of it,

642
00:35:57,961 --> 00:36:01,161
so like ten years from now 
I can be like, look how wrong Tim was.

643
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,901
Offscreen Voice: Did you guys fix this yet?

644
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:07,165
Gardner: Yeah. We're good.

645
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,280
Gardner: So you can see this is a long cut scene.

646
00:36:11,284 --> 00:36:12,924
Four thousand frames long.

647
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,387
Straight through all of it.

648
00:36:17,597 --> 00:36:22,074
Basically I just, you know, cut out a ton of stuff, put the wolf standing there.

649
00:36:22,074 --> 00:36:23,267
And then I send it over to Super Genius

650
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:25,867
and then they add all the like minor flurries.

651
00:36:25,867 --> 00:36:29,740
So it's, it was, like luckily that character

652
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:34,113
and the acting that we were looking 
for is easy to sort of refurbish,

653
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,300
which is also great because we 
were like, we were talking about

654
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,771
how those big other scenes of this, 
like I need get onto those things.

655
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,193
Crook: We're supposed to be locked 
down on our timing on all of our cut scenes,

656
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:47,614
which means Lydia can take it to do visual effects

657
00:36:47,614 --> 00:36:51,095
and Camden can take it and do sound effects.

658
00:36:51,095 --> 00:36:53,536
And so timing lock is supposed to be done by then.

659
00:36:53,536 --> 00:36:59,607
Except for these, the scenes that 
we don't have the dialogue for.

660
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:04,067
So I think Tim's going to go down this 
week and record some more dialogue.

661
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:11,020
So, but you know, I mean, we have plenty 
of other work that's, that has dialogue.

662
00:37:11,421 --> 00:37:15,461
So I wouldn't say that's, that's, 
we're waiting for it, you know.

663
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,585
It's kind of a good excuse to have.

664
00:37:18,741 --> 00:37:20,197
Oh, it's the dialogue.

665
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:22,769
We used that excuse for a long time with Tim.

666
00:37:22,769 --> 00:37:24,909
He's like, now you have your dialogue.

667
00:37:26,058 --> 00:37:29,968
Schafer: So I'm going down next 
weekend to record Shay and...

668
00:37:29,968 --> 00:37:30,783
Rice: This weekend.

669
00:37:30,783 --> 00:37:31,683
Schafer: This weekend.

670
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,043
Schafer: Next, this. Right?

671
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,491
You guys are coming down?

672
00:37:34,716 --> 00:37:37,716
Yeah, it's going to be a party 
in the studio and record Shay.

673
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,500
But we're very excited to announce 
Elijah Wood is in the game.

674
00:37:42,505 --> 00:37:43,565
I can now say that out loud,

675
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:47,581
because we've got the rights to 
announce Elijah Wood is in the game.

676
00:37:47,782 --> 00:37:50,424
It's not announced yet.

677
00:37:50,424 --> 00:37:53,044
It's totally not announced yet, so don't tell anyone.

678
00:37:57,917 --> 00:37:59,537
Schafer: So look at that.

679
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,370
Elijah Wood follows me, nice.

680
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:04,411
Sweet. Anyway.

681
00:38:06,276 --> 00:38:09,795
Actually, the very first data point in this whole thing,

682
00:38:09,795 --> 00:38:12,964
data point is a thing we use around 
the office when we want to sound smart.

683
00:38:12,964 --> 00:38:15,029
So the very first thing that happened was years ago

684
00:38:15,029 --> 00:38:18,144
I read in Entertainment Weekly 
an interview with Elijah Wood

685
00:38:18,144 --> 00:38:21,735
and he said his favorite video 
game of all time was Monkey Island.

686
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:25,900
And I was like, that's great, because 
no one ever mentions, you know,

687
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,541
he was talking about it like it was a work of art

688
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:29,234
in a way that people don't usually talk about video games,

689
00:38:29,234 --> 00:38:32,716
especially back then in the 
public, as being works of art.

690
00:38:32,716 --> 00:38:34,086
And I was like, that's so nice!

691
00:38:34,086 --> 00:38:36,557
He must be an adventure game player.

692
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:37,792
And since that, and it turns out it was true;

693
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:40,525
he was an adventure game player 
and he tweeted about Broken Age.

694
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:42,794
He'd seen, he'd gotten wind of the Kickstarter

695
00:38:42,794 --> 00:38:44,402
and gotten wind of the whole project.

696
00:38:44,402 --> 00:38:47,083
And he tweeted about how great it looked.

697
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,703
And I thought, that is awesome!

698
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,084
Brown: Were you thinking for the boy,

699
00:38:52,084 --> 00:38:55,404
were you thinking of like asking Elijah Wood for that?

700
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,500
Schafer: That'd be crazy if we did that.

701
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,228
Brown: Well, you could listen to his 
voice and see what you thought.

702
00:39:08,228 --> 00:39:09,448
Schafer: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

703
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:13,908
Brown: 'Cause I don't know if you 
guys have any kind of relationship at all.

704
00:39:13,908 --> 00:39:14,928
Schafer: Just on Twitter.

705
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:17,923
I mean, I would love it but I need to, I don't know.

706
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,265
I don't want to get my hopes up in case he can't do it,

707
00:39:20,265 --> 00:39:25,203
but also I want to make sure that that 
voice would be the exact right for the boy.

708
00:39:25,368 --> 00:39:27,028
I bet he could do it.

709
00:39:27,571 --> 00:39:28,371
He's a pro.

710
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,911
Schafer: And I was like, oh God,

711
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,658
that'd be crazy if he would actually be in the game.

712
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,763
That'd be crazy.

713
00:39:32,763 --> 00:39:33,959
But I don't want to like, you know,

714
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,173
I'm having fun with him 
just being interested in the game.

715
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,373
That's fun enough.

716
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,220
But like ah, I don't want to ruin it by asking,

717
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,360
but I was like he's, would you, this is crazy,

718
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,900
but would you, would you ever 
want to do a voice for the game,

719
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,528
like a little cameo or maybe all 
the lines for the main character?

720
00:39:47,528 --> 00:39:49,632
Schafer: I just got a direct message from Elijah.

721
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,617
Rice: What? As we were sitting here?

722
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,400
Schafer: Yeah. It says Tim, I sent you a,

723
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,374
I sent an email to Izzy at 
WME to inquire about the game

724
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,233
and told her that I'm a huge 
fan and I want to be a part of it.

725
00:40:01,598 --> 00:40:03,318
Rice: Yay!

726
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,360
Brown: Bull "S". For real?

727
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,797
Rice: That's what he said.

728
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,317
Schafer: That's the truth.

729
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,357
Want to see it?

730
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,236
Brown: That's f-ing awesome; I'm freaking out.

731
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,540
That rules.  He's super sweet and adorable.

732
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,500
Schafer: Apparently he's the best.

733
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,586
Brown: Everyone who's worked with him, loves him.

734
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,052
Schafer: That'd be great.

735
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,640
I hope it works out.

736
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,240
Brown: He watched the documentary 
and is talking about the poop thing.

737
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,980
Why is, that's going to be my legacy.

738
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,240
That's horrible.

739
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,160
Wait until you hear the hilarity here.

740
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,536
Wood: Rice Krispy Treats.

741
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,480
Rice Krispy Treats, dudes.

742
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,520
Schafer: I asked for those. 
Could you please...

743
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,743
Wood: Do you want like, do you 
want it to be more conspicuous,

744
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:47,439
like underneath the sweater or 
are we just like, fuck it, man?

745
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,425
Schafer: We are just like, fuck it.

746
00:40:48,425 --> 00:40:50,277
Wood: Yeah, yeah.

747
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,961
Here's the game.

748
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,867
Wood: Ahhh! 
Schafer: There's Shay.

749
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:57,672
Marek: It is not time to deploy the rescue system yet.

750
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,080
Wood: Is that Marek? Schafer: Um hm.

751
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,480
And there's our scratch dialogue.

752
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,280
Wood: Tim, this is great!

753
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,560
Schafer: You can tell he plays adventure game all the time.

754
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,520
He does.

755
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,978
Wood: A lot of experience.

756
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,445
Schafer: We don't want to give any spoilers out, though.

757
00:41:15,445 --> 00:41:19,538
Don't play too much, you'll, 
Wood: Wow, this is awesome.

758
00:41:19,953 --> 00:41:21,078
Amazing.

759
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,958
Schafer: OK. Cool.

760
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,820
Schafer: And he was totally 
into it, it was really great.

761
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,766
Because he obviously played 
a lot of adventure games

762
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,252
and from the very beginning we're like,

763
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,549
this is a page where you're going 
to say a lot of kind of nonsensical things

764
00:41:32,549 --> 00:41:35,831
and he was like, oh, you mean like 
this is where you use every single item

765
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,780
in your inventory on a character?

766
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,960
And you get a bunch of dumb 
responses, not dumb responses,

767
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,160
but he knew exactly what adventure 
games were like to play,

768
00:41:42,473 --> 00:41:43,715
so he knew how to read the lines.

769
00:41:43,715 --> 00:41:46,675
And it was one of those great 
experiences where he got every joke

770
00:41:46,675 --> 00:41:48,205
and he made them all funnier.

771
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:49,925
Wood: Do you know how to repair hexapals?

772
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,020
That sounds like a "no".

773
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,180
That sounds like a "no".

774
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,820
That sounds like a "no".

775
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,360
That sounds like a "no"?

776
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,360
That sounds like a "no".

777
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:04,880
Schafer: I'm sorry.

778
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,440
Are these Rice Krispy Treats gluten free?

779
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,420
Brown: Don't ask him that!

780
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,600
Wood: I don't know, actually.

781
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,234
Schafer: We're thinking they 
are, 'cause they're rice.

782
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,649
Wood: I think they are.

783
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,969
Schafer: It's very thoughtful of you.

784
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,000
Wood: You're welcome.

785
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,265
Schafer: Is there anything he 
won't do for you, Khris Brown?

786
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,820
Brown: I love him.

787
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,288
Schafer: He spends a little bit 
too much time doting on Khris,

788
00:42:23,288 --> 00:42:24,889
that's the problem with him.

789
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:26,029
He loves Khris too much.

790
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:27,089
Brown: Whatever, jealous.

791
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,455
Schafer: I know, I'm jealous of you.

792
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,120
But then I got the Rice Krispy Treats, so.

793
00:42:31,444 --> 00:42:32,626
Brown: Well, I'm watching my waistline...

794
00:42:32,626 --> 00:42:34,596
Schafer: Can't eat them on camera, 
though, 'cause they think I'm on a juice diet.

795
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:35,416
Brown: What?

796
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,440
Schafer: I'll eat it behind this napkin.

797
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,360
Brown: Here's what happens 
when you're on the juice diet!

798
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,600
Wood: My name is Shay and this is my
life on the incubator vessel, Bassinostra.

799
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,177
Schafer: He added something to Shay 
that I was worried we wouldn't have,

800
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,029
because Shay has this kind of character
 where he's irritated by his computer,

801
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,768
for being overprotective and so he's 
kind of like acting really over it.

802
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,987
And then wants to go on a really 
big adventure of his own that's real.

803
00:43:02,155 --> 00:43:04,676
But that could, if it's done wrong, 
come off as a really kind of

804
00:43:04,676 --> 00:43:08,402
whiny, irritating character, 
like waaahhh, like he's so over it.

805
00:43:08,402 --> 00:43:09,426
Like a jaded character.

806
00:43:09,426 --> 00:43:10,366
I thought that'd be irritating.

807
00:43:10,366 --> 00:43:13,050
But the way Elijah read the character, 
he's very empathetic.

808
00:43:13,255 --> 00:43:17,166
Like he's like, he seems really warm 
and just like he is just frustrated

809
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:19,197
and kind of pushing against 
the restraints of his world.

810
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:21,797
So I think he just added a depth 
to that character that wasn't there.

811
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,720
Or wouldn't have been there if 
we hadn't had an actor of that caliber

812
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,240
doing the role.

813
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,960
Wood: So it's time for a mutiny.

814
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,660
Time to put aside childish things.

815
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,100
Time to grab the wheel of this ship 
and steer it straight into the storm.

816
00:43:36,685 --> 00:43:41,054
Schafer: Ah, Red's, we are announcing, some voice,

817
00:43:41,054 --> 00:43:44,254
we're announcing Elijah at the 
VGX Awards this Saturday

818
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:50,498
and then we will be having all 
our VO will be final for Act One.

819
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,695
But we are working now on the 
finalization plan for everything that's

820
00:43:53,863 --> 00:44:00,063
going to happen to make the shipping 
of Broken Age in January go flawlessly.

821
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,556
The flawless execution...

822
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,500
of Broken Age.

823
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,758
We're working on a step-by-step plan 
that has not been circulated yet,

824
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,000
I don't believe.

825
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,320
But it's what you might expect 
if you're on the Broken Age team.

826
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,515
There's a whole bunch of stuff to do.

827
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,700
Oh God, a schedule, oooh.

828
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,520
I hate when these sneak up on you.

829
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,300
We're in the middle or starting this spaceship Beta for art.

830
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,885
Sugar Bunting Beta for animation and

831
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,256
gameplay programming is 
already on space Beta.

832
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:33,011
Rice: Yeah. The dates that we're 
aiming for currently are January 14th,

833
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:36,632
I believe, is the backer ship, 
which is Levi's birthday.

834
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,620
That's how we planned it.

835
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,060
Yeah, so then there's also holidays 
that are in the middle of there,

836
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,433
which will also prove...

837
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,460
Schafer: And then four days for the Dead Eye God and the Pyramid and the...

838
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,053
Rice: And the forest, yeah.

839
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,720
So those are the tricky ones for sure.

840
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,720
Gardner: There's so much animation 
that needs to be polished still.

841
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,750
I mean really.

842
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:58,090
Crook: Well, well, there's a lot that's, 
that's done but it's just not in.

843
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,440
Somewhat slow going but, 
Schafer: OK.

844
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,600
Does anyone want to say 
anything about the schedule?

845
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,305
Like how easy it looks?

846
00:45:06,305 --> 00:45:09,129
Petty: So let's say we do address the feedback

847
00:45:09,129 --> 00:45:10,951
that we have on Sugar Bunting to get to Beta.

848
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,055
Like everything's in it.

849
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:17,520
And then also enough on space boy,
spaceship to get that to Beta.

850
00:45:18,402 --> 00:45:19,844
Or maybe we slip a little bit.

851
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:23,362
I guess what's our plan if you know, 
if we do say we get to the end of this sprint

852
00:45:23,362 --> 00:45:25,603
and there's clearly some outstanding
 things on spaceship

853
00:45:25,603 --> 00:45:26,943
that we haven't yet reached?

854
00:45:26,943 --> 00:45:30,765
How do we prioritize that versus
 Shellmound, which is up next?

855
00:45:30,946 --> 00:45:33,739
Because if we keep going on, we're 
going to be cutting into what

856
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:36,603
we're calling bug/fix/polish time, but 
really that's just bug fixing time.

857
00:45:36,603 --> 00:45:38,603
Because the programmers can't 
guarantee a stable game

858
00:45:38,603 --> 00:45:40,829
if they have like two weeks of bug fix.

859
00:45:40,829 --> 00:45:41,469
I mean, that's nothing.

860
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,420
Petty: Coming to a head is one way to say it.

861
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,722
Wrapping up nicely and elegantly is another.

862
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,321
And yet a third way is, crash landing a plane.

863
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,340
I'm not saying either of those is appropriate.

864
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,860
Gardner: The way that we've been doing
 stuff, we kind of slip a little bit

865
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,420
and I'm worried that we're just going 
to keep slipping until the very end.

866
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,141
Rice: Yeah. And I think that's why it's good to have

867
00:46:02,174 --> 00:46:05,077
this kind of picture of the rest of development here,

868
00:46:05,077 --> 00:46:08,721
to where we know like the 14th and 
the 28th are the days that we're looking at.

869
00:46:08,721 --> 00:46:10,885
So that's the time we have to work with.

870
00:46:10,885 --> 00:46:16,231
And I think just trying to prioritize and weight things

871
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:21,925
to where we're making the most of 
that time is going to be the challenge.

872
00:46:21,925 --> 00:46:26,457
Petty: And I guess my interpretation 
of looking at schedule is, that sort of,

873
00:46:26,457 --> 00:46:31,681
we need to have a much more 
structured definition of arbitrary polish

874
00:46:31,681 --> 00:46:34,846
to that date or we're never going 
to get the game's bugs under control.

875
00:46:34,846 --> 00:46:37,586
And you know, I'm sure there 
are categories that are simple.

876
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,350
It's not like we're going to leave 
a missing animation

877
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:40,690
or someone locked in a "T" pose, right?

878
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:42,055
Like that's clearly a bug.

879
00:46:42,055 --> 00:46:46,848
But you know, if I really liked to 
have that plant waving in the background

880
00:46:46,848 --> 00:46:49,380
or it's not quite as polished as, 
or the composition's slightly off

881
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,502
in this one frame, well, I think 
the ship has sailed at that point on that stuff.

882
00:46:52,502 --> 00:46:54,838
Unless there really, unless it's incredibly low risk

883
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:56,578
and there's nothing else that's prior priority.

884
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,016
Rice: But yeah, there's a lot 
to do in the few months left.

885
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:05,000
Rice: There's just a lot to do and 
everyone's kind of aware of it.

886
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,381
So I think people are just really 
trying to push forward right now.

887
00:47:08,381 --> 00:47:11,262
Yeah, it's about two months

888
00:47:11,262 --> 00:47:14,831
'til we're saying pencils down 
and total bug fixing mode.

889
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:20,669
But I would imagine that people will 
start pulling longer hours and you know,

890
00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:25,369
trying to get every last bit of polish 
into the game as possible.

891
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,093
Crook: We just realized we have 
a lot of work still ahead of us,

892
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:35,735
so I'm just, you know, at night 
I can, I kind of focus on animation.

893
00:47:35,968 --> 00:47:40,028
I don't have to answer questions 
or run around, which is fine;

894
00:47:40,028 --> 00:47:42,144
that's what I'm supposed to do during the day,

895
00:47:42,144 --> 00:47:46,144
but it doesn't let me get a lot 
of the tasks that I have on my list.

896
00:47:46,652 --> 00:47:47,992
So it's just, it's a, you know,

897
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,386
it's a process that everything's 
sort of by hand, you know, still.

898
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:01,552
It's a craft that is, you're still sort 
of hand building things, you know.

899
00:48:01,552 --> 00:48:04,052
It's not really a production line.

900
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,080
And those things take time.

901
00:48:08,688 --> 00:48:11,368
So, but that's what makes the job fun.

902
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,380
That's why I like Double Fine, 
'cause we still do that.

903
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,800
You know, we still sort of do things by hand.

904
00:48:20,627 --> 00:48:23,227
But you know, it can also make it hard.

905
00:48:25,408 --> 00:48:26,526
Schafer: I feel bad for Ray.

906
00:48:26,526 --> 00:48:29,231
Ray's a family man; he shouldn't 
be staying here late.

907
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:30,311
But he is.

908
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:34,474
So I say no, no, don't do it.

909
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,760
Although I totally rely on him to do that 
so the schedule actually makes sense.

910
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,587
Schafer: This footage would be better 
if I made this into a metaphor,

911
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,067
like the way that car turned out 
to be a perfect metaphor,

912
00:48:46,067 --> 00:48:50,146
but you know, making a game is 
a little bit like decorating a tree.

913
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,460
You take small ornaments from a box, 
you hang them on the various branches.

914
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:03,560
The branches are a metaphor 
for the backers, who hold up.

915
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,900
The ornaments are the sound effects.

916
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:13,080
And lights are the voice actors.

917
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:15,490
See how that works?

918
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,560
Now do you understand game development?

It's exciting, though, isn't it?

Don't you love that smell?

924
00:50:09,419 --> 00:50:11,310
I'm just worried that a paper wad will get shot off,

925
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:13,470
like that guy who got killed in Voyagers.

926
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,100
It was a similar thing.
