2
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,840
Petty: So I can double-check
that he put everything up.

3
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,660
The rest of them, I'm going to scan them
all, yeah, so we can have them.

4
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,560
We have a, you know,
our concept art directory.

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,799
You know, in theory if all the puzzles were
done and the things were decided on,

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,640
we could actually make a pretty functional
game with really rough art early on

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,966
to sort of unblock the puzzle
design or implementation.

8
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:49,054
And some of the systems
work, which would be nice.

9
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:49,838
I'm not sure.

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,205
I'm a big fan of working that way,

11
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:53,580
but I'm not sure if we'll be able
to do it for this project or not.

12
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,800
We'll have to see how that works out.

13
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:30,296
[Music]

14
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,316
Rice: Yep.

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,317
If you're always showing this board,
won't they get spoilers from the board?

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,300
So just to bring us up to date, I need
another location for the cloud nest.

17
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,360
Things that came up from the art jam.

18
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,580
Cloud nests.

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,160
Rice: You can tell that
that's going to look awesome.

20
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,120
Schafer: The first thing
Peter mentioned, too.

21
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,680
Rice: Yeah, I think he
drew that the first day.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,980
Schafer: And then the other
one is the dead-eye pyramid.

23
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,440
Rice: Why is it dead-eye?

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,860
Schafer: Spoiler. Can't tell you.

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,760
Rice: I have to play
the game to find out?

26
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,940
Schafer: These things all still work
but maybe this becomes his story.

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,580
The monster lands move over here.

28
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,160
Maybe that moves over there.

29
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,800
Rice: What I still am not clear on is,
and I don't know if you are,

30
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,840
is switching back and
forth between these stories

31
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,460
and how we're going to handle that.

32
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,780
Schafer: Yeah.

33
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,840
I'm putting that off.

34
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,102
Rice: Yeah. Start thinking about it.

35
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,820
So I'm just wondering then,
like if I'm here, here and here

36
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,913
and I jump back to this,
then what's the world like?

37
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,220
Like why can't I do this and what happens
that makes me so I can do this?

38
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,680
Schafer: I don't know. I don't know yet.

39
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,420
Schafer: I've been a little behind.

40
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:08,254
It's frustrating because I, when
the team is waiting for you,

41
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,663
that's always frustrating, so.

42
00:03:09,663 --> 00:03:10,463
It's always been that way.

43
00:03:10,463 --> 00:03:14,660
Like having an absolutely terrifying
deadline is the only thing that,

44
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,080
makes me get it done.

45
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,660
There's just so many other things
going on with the company right now that,

46
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,007
you know, The Cave is getting to this
point where it needs, you know,

47
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:26,047
it has a dialogue deadline of its own.

48
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:30,227
You know, and do I help with that
or do I work on this game?

49
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,480
Suck it!

50
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
[Monster Roar]

51
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,943
Schafer: Peter McConnell's here today.

52
00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:51,034
It's fun to see what
he's going to add to it.

53
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,480
Schafer: So the game.

54
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,460
You see, we did some art already.

55
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,140
We had art jam with Peter Chan and
Scott Campbell and Nathan came to town

56
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,234
and hung out with Lee, and did some art.

57
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,140
And that's cool.

58
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,445
And that corkboard
is kind of up-to-date.

59
00:04:01,445 --> 00:04:07,111
I could add some as we talk, but we're
doing a point and click graphic adventure.

60
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,560
I don't know if you heard that.
McConnell: Very cool.

61
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,305
Schafer: So it doesn't have a
high concept in terms of like

62
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:15,249
a heavy metal fantasy world
or the Day of the Dead.

63
00:04:15,249 --> 00:04:19,386
It's really like a new world that we're
making up based on Nathan Stapley's art.

64
00:04:19,386 --> 00:04:23,693
You know, just having that cool look
and having it be about themes

65
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,500
that are different, maybe
than other themes.

66
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,161
McConnell: Yeah. I've got questions.

67
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,736
Schafer: There'll be no
questions during this meeting.

68
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,160
Schafer: Is Peter McConnell
excited to be on the project?

69
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,397
You're asking me if he's excited?

70
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,321
I think so.

71
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,441
We always enjoyed working together.

72
00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:41,519
You know, he's worked on
everything I've done since

73
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:44,521
Day of the Tentacle,
Monkey II, Monkey II.

74
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:45,701
Offscreen Voice: He's
like your Danny Elfman.

75
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:46,521
Schafer: He's what?

76
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:47,572
Offscreen Voice: He's
like your Danny Elfman.

77
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,000
Schafer: He's like my Danny Elfman.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,321
He can do Danny Elfman
if you ask him to.

79
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,140
McConnell: I'm just thinking
about instruments, you know.

80
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,378
I'm thinking about styles

81
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,278
and I'm probably going to
have to think quite a bit about it,

82
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,900
because it's, I mean, I have some things
that are popping into my head.

83
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,935
I don't know if they're probably way
jumping the gun at this point.

84
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:11,634
But what comes to mind about, about
a world where things are being made for you

85
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,340
and it's like a playroom a
little bit, is a music box.

86
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,040
And you know, a little bit like
Mr. Roger's Neighborhood, which…

87
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,887
Schafer: It also has that
repetitive quality to it.

88
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,570
Because the game is
going to start in this like,

89
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,790
his routine is the same every day,
even though it's drastically different.

90
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,625
It's really like he wakes up,
the robots dress him.

91
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:34,141
You know, the arms just come out of
nowhere and make him dinner, food.

92
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:38,678
And then when he busts out and he's
doing actual 90's, 80's creepy space adventure.

93
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,888
Or 2001 like.

94
00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:42,488
McConnell: Yeah. Schafer: Yeah.

95
00:05:42,488 --> 00:05:49,422
McConnell: Then 2001 would be,
2001 will be hard to do, you know,

96
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:51,260
without a great big orchestra.

97
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,900
And I don't think we have that.

98
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,608
But I don't think, you know.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,458
Schafer: And now it's
like a little more like now

100
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,551
we're running our own actual budget.

101
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,039
Schafer: It's like we have a certain
amount of money in the budget for Peter,

102
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,738
which means a certain amount of time.

103
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,342
And we have to like wait
until we're ready for him

104
00:06:07,342 --> 00:06:08,975
to be really effective in working.

105
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,350
So we've got to be at a point
where we can just tell him,

106
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,080
here's a list of characters
that need themes.

107
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,743
Here's a list of areas, 'cause he's
got to spread out his time

108
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:18,523
so he doesn't just score the first two
acts and then run out of time.

109
00:06:18,523 --> 00:06:20,940
So he's got to like spread it
out, look at the whole game,

110
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,245
think about the game play.

111
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,674
Then think about how much of
that money he should save

112
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,880
to pay for things like live musicians.

113
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,560
Studio time.

114
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,780
McConnell: Yeah, I think there is going to
have to be a signature piece, for sure.

115
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,234
And that is, or you know, or two
halves of the signature piece

116
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,660
because you got these two worlds.

117
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,510
Min: Yeah, yeah, that, too.

118
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,360
Rice: It'll be interesting to see
how we can handle that.

119
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,598
You know, like if there're themes that
persist in both their worlds or you know,

120
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,020
funny little things to do
to connect their two.

121
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,340
Min: I think that Pete's going to
be able to knock that out pretty easily.

122
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,534
I think it's more the initial, but then it's
the same thing with Tim, you know,

123
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,380
I mean you go crazy for two days

124
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,860
and then on the third day you just
kind of come up with something.

125
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,858
You know, that's how
creative magic happens.

126
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,482
I mean, and I think it's
almost like you have

127
00:07:06,482 --> 00:07:09,622
to be patient with
yourself and not, not panic.

128
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,760
McConnell: You know, that backer
money don't last forever.

129
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,680
Rice: That's the truth.

130
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:22,500
Music

131
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,260
Lumberjack: That's not a word, is it?

132
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,700
Tree: No. We're done here.

133
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,740
Kipnis: Yes!
Schafer: Awesome. Done. Rice: Yeah.

134
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,060
For the last four months we've
spent in preproduction mode

135
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:39,270
and it's been kind of exploratory phase of
trying to figure out what the game is

136
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,780
and both in terms of design,

137
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,300
but also in how we're going
to actually make that happen.

138
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,525
But yeah, everyone's kind of had
their own separate little tasks

139
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:52,247
and those are all starting
to converge now to where

140
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:55,867
we're ready to start actually
building a puzzle in the engine.

141
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,180
Crook: Actual production
work is awesome.

142
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,740
Like we're going to go,
this could get shipped.

143
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,340
Like this work.

144
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,480
Schafer: We'll see how it turns out.

145
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,760
Crook: Yeah, we'll see.

146
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,220
Rice: Ray Crook, Double Fine animator.

147
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,020
Yeah, Ray started on the project and he's
been someone who's been at the company

148
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,242
since like essentially the beginning.

149
00:08:15,242 --> 00:08:18,357
Crook: I was excited to
work with Tim again,

150
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,181
because Brutal Legend
was the last game that,

151
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:24,454
you know, we'd worked
closely together on.

152
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,985
And so I was most excited
just to work with him.

153
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:32,025
But you know, I knew
there would be cameras.

154
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,320
Crook: So I'm actually
excited to be starting on that.

155
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,500
Crook: You know, the beginning of
preproduction is really exciting

156
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,299
and then it seems like
eventually it gets kind of like,

157
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,979
you're just kind of churning.

158
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,040
You know, I guess just, let's
just get this show on the road,

159
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,050
you know, is sort of
the way that it feels.

160
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,830
And that's where we are.

161
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,815
Schafer: Awesome. Bye.

162
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,956
Crook: Tim has picked a puzzle,
which we're calling First Playable.

163
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Petty: So these are some of
the stuff Peter gave me on Friday, right?

164
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,857
And so I think this is the stuff we
talked about when he was here,

165
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,020
which is the idea of them having
this little sacrificial island, which is awesome.

166
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,180
Cakes, in a U.  But I was
still worried about like

167
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,334
if you put this into game
camera mode, game layout mode,

168
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,940
that'd be kind of blocked up.

169
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,260
And I did this real rough thing.

170
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,940
I just got Peter's revision, right.

171
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,277
And so this was the idea like from
a game camera you would be,

172
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,331
you would kind of start here.

173
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,260
So we could start with a pan and
we kind of move up and we kind of…

174
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,647
Rice: But yeah, it's the scene
where the main character,

175
00:09:30,647 --> 00:09:35,217
I mean main female character is being
offered up for sacrifice to a monster.

176
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,320
Schafer: Could it show up
just behind the princess?

177
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,330
You just see something like feet?

178
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,050
Like what the fuck is it!?  Petty: Yeah.

179
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,201
Schafer: You can't see it all, then it
comes between, like oh my God!

180
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:44,234
And it's gone.

181
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,882
You just never see it up close until it gets,
comes in here and like eats that one.

182
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,944
Rice: Yeah, it's going to be
a lot of work, for sure,

183
00:09:50,944 --> 00:09:55,006
because it's just a lot of
animation and cut scenes.

184
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:57,306
So it's going to be a tough one.

185
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,069
Stapley: So you're saying
for the end of this sprint

186
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:09,023
we're really going to try to get the,
get the sacrifice feast all set up?

187
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:12,340
'Cause that's the thing, like if every
puzzle's going to have like say

188
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,740
five or so new characters, that's
like, kind of a lot of time.

189
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,192
Petty: Well, and that's exactly why
we want to take this to finals,

190
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,490
because it's just conjecture

191
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,912
until we kind of get an area to
really know exactly how long.

192
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,909
I made estimates based on our progress.

193
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:28,169
Petty: Like there's always this period
that when you start any game

194
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,769
where you're trying to,
you're trying to build it,

195
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:35,989
you're trying to build something both
at like artistically you're like yeah,

196
00:10:35,989 --> 00:10:39,138
it's the right mood, that's the right
game play, that's the right look.

197
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,622
But you're also trying to build
something to get an idea of

198
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:46,082
how long it takes you to
build the rest of the game.

199
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:48,125
And part of that is you need,
you need enough information

200
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,338
about the rest of the game,

201
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,534
like you know, there's always this
theoretical ideal that you never get.

202
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,359
Like the whole game is written,
every puzzle's designed,

203
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,100
you know, all the art
direction's completely done.

204
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,033
I've never in my whatever years
I've worked in the game industry,

205
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,336
ever seen that happen.

206
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,063
Some projects are closer
to that than others.

207
00:11:05,063 --> 00:11:07,543
So there's a lot of
uncertainty at that point.

208
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,700
Stapley: Yeah, sounds good and scary.

209
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,279
Schafer: Bagel, why you so scared?

210
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,996
Stapley: I think because I haven't seen
anything like in the game yet, you know.

211
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,880
Like it's still the lumberjack dude.

212
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,900
I'd just love to see how easy
it's going to be reshape things

213
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,471
and put things in and take things out
and change things and add things.

214
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:31,049
Petty: What you really have to do,
I think, is lay the best foundation you can.

215
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:35,599
Be mindful of what you're making and then
just be clever as you're making the game.

216
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,280
Look for opportunities to save
time or to reuse things

217
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,324
or to go in new directions that
are just more efficient

218
00:11:42,324 --> 00:11:44,644
or take some of the lessons you've
learned from the earlier areas

219
00:11:44,644 --> 00:11:46,324
and adapt your later areas to it.

220
00:11:46,324 --> 00:11:49,484
So, that's, and that's,
that's what I try and do

221
00:11:49,484 --> 00:11:52,044
and I think most people on the
team try to do it in any game.

222
00:11:52,300 --> 00:12:01,480
[Music]

223
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,064
Offscreen Voice: She wants
to be skinny, right?

224
00:12:03,064 --> 00:12:03,744
And look skinny.

225
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:06,507
So maybe it's something that helps
her look slimmer sometime?

226
00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:08,527
Schafer: Corset. Offscreen Voice: Yeah.

227
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,427
Schafer: But you put
corset on the buzzard.

228
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,659
Oh, wait. That could be awesome.

229
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,100
Offscreen Voice: That
could be totally awesome.

230
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,720
Schafer: So strange. A corset buzzard
with a drumstick in his arm.

231
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,521
This is where I
start getting interested.

232
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,100
Schafer: Like I haven't seen like the
maiden feast thing all wired up yet,

233
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,316
but that is in the game, I hear.

234
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,461
Have you seen that?

235
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:30,001
I've been out of it in meetings.

236
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,821
Things are happening so fast.

237
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,443
Petty: You know what did
so far in it, is you know,

238
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:36,344
we had this sort of layout
drawing that we did.

239
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:39,707
And we took those layout
drawings and cut them up.

240
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:43,390
And you can sort of see things
exist in the tool here in parallax.

241
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,380
We don't have the game camera
authored or anything, like you know,

242
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,706
you could rough in the game play
right now if you wanted to.

243
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:50,455
This isn't the, a real monster design.

244
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,957
That's not a real bird design.

245
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,545
Those aren't real character designs,
but they are, you know,

246
00:12:55,545 --> 00:12:59,382
they have the underlying
script components to them.

247
00:12:59,382 --> 00:13:02,402
And so, you know, once those,
you can sort of see here this is just,

248
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:03,985
if we run the game at
this scene at the moment

249
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:05,814
we don't actually have a main character.

250
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,867
So you know, one could hookup
dialogue and have proxy object

251
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:11,524
dragging and all that sort of stuff.

252
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,444
So that's the biggest thing I want to
do with it, was put enough of it together

253
00:13:14,444 --> 00:13:17,332
that Bagel could do some painting
and learn from the painting.

254
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,740
And if the programmers want to script
that one first they can.

255
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,440
Franzke: Stuff should go time-wise like,

256
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,800
well, at least roughly, right,
you need those animations

257
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,832
Kipnis: Think of the sound guys,
that's what they use as well.

258
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,645
Petty: Well, this happened
but their workflow,

259
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:31,185
all they do, is they take…

260
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,406
Kipnis: Oh! [Power out]

261
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,520
Schafer: Well, it is lunchtime.

262
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,000
Offscreen Voice: It could
have been worse.

263
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:41,974
Offscreen Voice: Do you see yourself
having a huge workload on this?

264
00:13:41,974 --> 00:13:45,172
Crook: Yes. Yeah, we
started going through it

265
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:48,827
and I figure, I mean it's
a Tim Schafer game.

266
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,187
He likes characters, he likes dialogue.

267
00:13:51,187 --> 00:13:52,390
And there'll be cut scenes.

268
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,429
Crook: I don't know.

269
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:55,485
I'm not sure what Tim wants
as far as fidelity on cut scenes.

270
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:56,765
Like I don't know.

271
00:13:56,765 --> 00:13:58,336
Petty: The question is how
Full Throttle are we?

272
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,876
Crook: Right. Right.

273
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,480
For an animator this is horrible. But,

274
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,800
Franzke: I mean, like what if you could
just do all that stuff in Maya

275
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,580
Crook: We'll see how much of it we
can auto-gen as far as like lip-sync

276
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,920
and that sort of thing.

277
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,113
I just, I just hope, you know,
sometimes you do something,

278
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,620
you think, oh, we'll just automate it.

279
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,548
And then you do it and like
ah, it's not going to work.

280
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:20,246
You know, we need to just have,
you know, artists go in and do this.

281
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:26,851
Crook: So this was sort of a
test animation that I did yesterday.

282
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,998
And so she's stuck in this cake.

283
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,023
And then this just shows you her
turning, just to see what kind of,

284
00:14:33,023 --> 00:14:35,771
if we can get a quick turn out of her.

285
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,050
And so we already have
the composition decided on

286
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,406
so we know what the position of
each of these characters will be in.

287
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:47,677
So when Bagel did the
initial designs, which is here,

288
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,804
he took that into consideration.

289
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:53,259
And so we know that she will
never have to turn any more than

290
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,990
what she does right there.

291
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,523
Rice: Just because that's
kind of a whole new process,

292
00:14:57,523 --> 00:15:00,663
the 2D animation is something we
haven't done here at Double Fine.

293
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,700
And we're doing it in a way that is
similar to how we animate in 3D so that helps.

294
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,904
But that could easily be something that's
a lot more work than we're expecting.

295
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,160
Petty: Yeah, I'm not sure how we're
going to handle the tentacles

296
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,739
because when we talked about maybe
doing them purely as flip book animation,

297
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,335
because we are, we don't have, we
can't have enough joints in this engine to do,

298
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,884
to like animate them all freely.

299
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,686
Schafer: Is there a special close-up
monster different than the...?

300
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,370
Petty: We don't do any special close-up.

301
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,670
We do one version for everything
unless we have to do it,

302
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,740
because it's just a lot more work.

303
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,029
Schafer: Maybe not to joint everything
that you don't want to joint.

304
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:40,149
Or is it the painting of the details or is
the mouth shapes and all that stuff?

305
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:41,829
Petty: All the above.

306
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,298
Rice: We're still working on like our first
playable puzzle from the actual game.

307
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,393
We kind of bit off a big one.

308
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,423
So that's happening now.

309
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,280
Crook: So you know, when
I was creating lists

310
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,500
and I've been working
with Lee on schedule

311
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,946
and it's, it's, it's going
to get hairy, I think.

312
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,214
Petty: And then his
overall layout of that area,

313
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,880
I think this shows, this shows where
it is relative to the village.

314
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,960
Schafer: Things look great.

315
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,580
Schafer: So we'll meet with Peter.

316
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,400
Chan: This is kind of the square, but I,
you know, it could be a lot bigger,

317
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,776
but I wanted to just show what it
might look like down the street.

318
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,900
Schafer: I guess I'd like, I haven't
seen any, I mean, I like the...

319
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,360
Schafer: Yeah, some things are bugging
me about those mushroom houses.

320
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,557
For one, I hate mushrooms.

321
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,453
But two, it's like, oh, mushroom houses.

322
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,398
What is that making me think of?

323
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,594
And I thought Smurfs.

324
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,372
Schafer: You know, my only worry about
the mushroom town is if it invokes Smurfdom,

325
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,279
you know, because there is that kind of
Smurf shape with mushrooms a little bit.

326
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:51,855
So when I see the big castle's one big
mushroom, you know, there's parts,

327
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:55,119
there's shapes of mushrooms that don't
evoke that and there's shapes that do.

328
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:57,119
Petty: Like this doesn't really,
right? Chan: OK.

329
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,340
Schafer: No, that looks more like a…

330
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:02,474
Chan: Greg? When is my last day?

331
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,262
Petty: August tenth. August tenth.

332
00:17:04,262 --> 00:17:08,347
Chan: Wow. OK.

333
00:17:08,347 --> 00:17:11,307
So then we are, it's...
Rice: Getting there.

334
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:12,406
Chan: We're running out of time.

335
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,126
Schafer: Get drawing right now.

336
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,960
Chan: We've only just scratched the
surface really, by that.  We're still...

337
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,680
Schafer: We'll get more money
later and have you back.

338
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:28,179
Rice: You know, we got a lot of money but
that money goes a lot of places

339
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,116
and it's expensive to run a studio like
Double Fine in San Francisco.

340
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,651
So there's only so long we can have
this many people on the project

341
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,285
without running out of money.

342
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:40,389
We've got to make sure that we make
something great in that amount of time.

343
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,440
Schafer: OK.

344
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,060
Chan: Anything else? Schafer: Not me.

345
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,920
Petty: No, no. I'll call you soon.

346
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,780
Chan: OK, cool. I'm going to hang up.

347
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,320
You guys have a great rest of the day.

348
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,448
Schafer: Thanks, you too Peter. Bye.

349
00:17:51,448 --> 00:17:53,008
Chan: OK, thank you, bye-bye.

350
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,460
Schafer: So like I really do like
all this stuff, and this stuff.

351
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,861
And that all works, too.

352
00:17:57,861 --> 00:18:01,374
Like I was, I hope I didn't hurt
his feelings by saying Smurfs.

353
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,321
Sometimes you never know...Smurfs..

354
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:05,521
Petty: It's really hard not to
offend artists all the time.

355
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:07,345
Schafer: But that's my only
worry about some of this stuff.

356
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:10,282
Because I, I mean,
I like it but he did go,

357
00:18:10,282 --> 00:18:12,562
like the very first thing
that he ever talked about

358
00:18:12,562 --> 00:18:16,354
was this Japanese/Scandinavian
combination mushroom thing.

359
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,789
And so it's really hard
to say like I like it,

360
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:21,949
but I had seen anything else,
except I did also like

361
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:26,091
some of Bagel's crazy geometric
weird thing that he was doing, too.

362
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,218
That was kind of a unique
look for the castle.

363
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,580
Yeah, I mean I know Bagel's
got a lot of backgrounds to do

364
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,780
but I would like to see if he could come
up with any ideas about the buzzard.

365
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,740
Petty: So is Bagel, yeah, I mean, so
what we have to do, like with,

366
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,900
I guess we can talk about this
in the reviews or review meeting,

367
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,513
but Bagel right now, just, just
to paint what we already designed

368
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,848
for just the sacrifice puzzle will
take him this entire sprint.

369
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:51,080
He doesn't, he really doesn't have
time for, for any concept art at all.

370
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,704
He has time to interpret it like
when he gets to like paint it

371
00:18:53,704 --> 00:18:55,530
and that's sort of built into the time.

372
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,020
And if, we can certainly do any of that
but it comes at the cost of

373
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,300
we either need to come up with
another solution for painting that-

374
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,518
Schafer: The problem with that is that
doesn't really solve the problem

375
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,750
of like having a game
be in Bagel's style.

376
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,390
'Cause if he isn't doing the concept
part of it, then it's not really,

377
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,950
Petty: well I dissagree...
Schafer:  it's his rendering style but it's not his like...

378
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,021
Petty: But that's what his painting is.

379
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:13,512
You're not using the 
content from his painting.

380
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,712
You're not using the "Bob's Big Boy"

381
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,840
Schafer: When I talked about
like wanting to capture

382
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,849
some of the crazy stuff
from his fine art show,

383
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:20,740
there was a little guy on the table or the
woman with the mouth in her hair.

384
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,362
Like those are more ideas than
about a rendering style.

385
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,481
So like I wanted to
capture some of Bagel's,

386
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:29,621
some more surreal ideas in
the game concept, too.

387
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,340
Not just, not just his
rendering style, for sure.

388
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,588
Petty: Well then we need to
come up with another plan,

389
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:37,148
because right now it's not possible.

390
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,815
Schafer: But, 'cause I'm torn.

391
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,340
Because I also want Bagel to do
concepts, like come up with crazy ideas.

392
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,439
That's one of the things I like about
his art, is that he has these, you know,

393
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,860
kind of crazy surreal
ideas in his painting.

394
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,060
Not just the rendering style of it.

395
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,853
Rice: But yeah, I mean it was
a hard choice, you know,

396
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,727
when Tim decided that he wanted the
game to reflect Bagel's style.

397
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:02,831
Ultimately that means that he's going to
have to paint a lot of the game,

398
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,060
if not all of the game.

399
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:09,900
And it's going to be what makes the game
have kind of a cohesive feel and look.

400
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,700
Petty: I don't see how
it's going to work.

401
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,000
So we could either do
something like, you know,

402
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,680
someone else could render the characters

403
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,232
to give him time to do concept
design or someone, I don't know.

404
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,340
Something like that, some hybrid
sort of rendering style solution

405
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,931
that can work in a very similar style.

406
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,786
That's the only, you know, we'll have
to figure something like that out.

407
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,040
Because there just isn't time for
one person to do all that.

408
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,997
Schafer: I love this meeting wherein
we talk about can't be done.

409
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,537
Because those are always like,
those are kind of a drag,

410
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,040
'cause you're like trying,
you're trying to invent stuff.

411
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,950
You know, you're having this
problem with nothing to something,

412
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,413
like OK, I got an idea.

413
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,440
And someone says
that'll take three years;

414
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,260
you can't do it.

415
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,560
And you're like oh.

416
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,348
Do you know how hard
that was to have that idea?

417
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,360
Schafer: OK, I have to go do something.

418
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,200
Petty: OK. So...

419
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,180
Schafer: As much as
I would like to talk about

420
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,180
how we can't make this
awesome game in time.

421
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,440
Petty: I thought I was coming
up with ways that we could.

422
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:13,020
Schafer: I know. I'm going to
check out that inventory stuff.

423
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,620
Rice: Bye.

424
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,936
Schafer: Hey, Anna.
Kipnis: Yeah?

425
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,020
Can I see all that cool
inventory stuff I missed?

426
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,160
Petty: We're just going to wind up
shipping a game about a red bot

427
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,380
and a fucking lumberjack.

428
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,159
Sorry, Tim.

429
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,088
We decided to ship these instead.

430
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:34,090
Crook: Ran out of time.

431
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,430
Franzke: We ran out of time.
We did create all kind of tech for it...

432
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,719
Thank God it's up to you to make a game.

433
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,960
Here's a tool set, go
do whatever you want.

434
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,249
Rice: Yeah, I think there's
always a point in a project

435
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:48,241
where everything kind of gets real
and you see the amount of work

436
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:50,005
that you have in front of you.

437
00:21:50,005 --> 00:21:52,578
There was a bit of an eye-opener
just through the docs

438
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,920
and the processes as far
as how much work is left.

439
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,607
And how much we can, we can do.

440
00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:02,167
And the amount of time we have left.

441
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,627
Rice: It was an eye-opener that
we needed to get to the moment

442
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:10,207
where we're like OK, we need
to start building this game.

443
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:12,798
And we're getting to
the point where yeah,

444
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,280
where now the real work is beginning.

445
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,860
Schafer: Who was it,
it was like Miyamoto.

446
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,275
He said that famous quote about like
it only hurts until it's done,

447
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,340
but if it sucks, it sucks
forever, you know.

448
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,526
Schafer: So like OK, we'll suffer now,

449
00:22:25,526 --> 00:22:27,179
we'll put the extra work
in to make this great,

450
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,800
because no one's going to remember,
you know, no one ever says about a game like,

451
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,948
oh you know, that game had a really
reasonable production cycle.

452
00:22:32,948 --> 00:22:34,260
That was, I really enjoyed that game.

453
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,860
It was really moderately scheduled.

454
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,073
Rice: This was our
fourth milestone of 13.

455
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,211
So we need to start kind of pushing
forward, getting some content together

456
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,061
if we're going to stay on track.

457
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:50,721
Schafer: I mean, off of
what I'm pushing for

458
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:52,557
is like we should just think
about this problem longer,

459
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,345
because we're going to
have a creative solution

460
00:22:54,345 --> 00:22:57,316
that's going to allow us to have
the great thing that I want,

461
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,918
but have it not take 20
years to put together.

462
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,767
It'll take, we'll think of the cheap.

463
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,642
You know, Lee and those
guys are really smart

464
00:23:03,642 --> 00:23:05,522
and they could probably think
of a clever way to, you know,

465
00:23:05,522 --> 00:23:07,202
cut the work in half and get it done.

466
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,280
Schafer: But it's hard to
commit to that in advance.

467
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,686
Like OK, I'll have a clever idea
and it'll cut this work in half,

468
00:23:11,686 --> 00:23:14,606
'cause you know, those things you
don't know they're going to come.

469
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,680
But they always come.

470
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:27,060
[Music]

471
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,609
Offscreen Voice: Bye, guys.
See you tomorrow.

472
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:54,860
[Music]

473
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,153
Rice: Potentially getting some
art interns from the Institute.

474
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,880
That could do, you know, like the
menial tasks nobody wants to do.

475
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
Franzke: Well not even menial,
like, I mean all of my plans...
