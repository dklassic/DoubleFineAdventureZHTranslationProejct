"00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:35,274",Schafer: I need to get accustomed to money being around.
"00:00:35,274 --> 00:00:37,002",That's the thing.
"00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:41,029","This is for the therapy, the physical therapy of getting me used to actually not being afraid of money."
"00:00:41,029 --> 00:00:43,249",Offscreen voice: Richard Branson does the same thing.
"00:00:43,249 --> 00:00:46,755","Schafer: Ah! You guys, what is this stuff that's all over me?"
"00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,287",Offscreen voice: Beautiful.
"00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:49,552",Schafer: I can't apply it to myself..
"00:00:49,552 --> 00:00:50,632",Offscreen voice: Oh my God.
"00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:52,113",Schafer: I can't self-terminate.
"00:00:52,113 --> 00:00:53,470",Offscreen voice: Help me apply money.
"00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,872",Schafer: I can't self-monetize.
"00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,120","Schafer: So this is a more recent, uh point-and-click adventure game."
"00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:29,962","I have to show you someone else's, because I haven't made one in a long time."
"00:01:29,962 --> 00:01:31,565",I used to make them back in the '90s.
"00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:33,569",This is Machinarium.
"00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:35,512",You role play this little robot and you click around.
"00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:41,245","And these kind of games, you walk the character around by clicking on the ground somewhere and pull on this handle here."
"00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:43,987",And then I can make this mine cart come through the room.
"00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:45,529",Shahani: I'm sorry. What's that?
"00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:47,657","Schafer: I pulled this handle, oh, that's right."
"00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:49,968",This doesn't work until I do this.
"00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:52,188",That's what a lot of adventure game playing is like.
"00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:54,622","You're like, oh, this doesn't, why doesn't this work?"
"00:01:54,622 --> 00:01:56,166","Oh, I need this gear first."
"00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,984",I need to get the gear on the sprocket.
"00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,710","And so they're, they move at a slower pace."
"00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,775",And some people really like that.
"00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:10,126",But it also means they're not exactly as attention-getting and as visceral and maybe as a big block buster action game.
"00:02:10,126 --> 00:02:14,565","And it led us to this point now where it's really hard to get one of these games made these days,"
"00:02:14,565 --> 00:02:17,308",or at least get funding for it from a publisher.
"00:02:17,308 --> 00:02:20,513","Shahani: Before getting into all that, what put you on the map?"
"00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:24,919","Like, just describe the game that got you into game famous."
"00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,615",Schafer: Game famous.
"00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:30,807","You know, we just, each game we made in the '90s, we got a little more recognition for it."
"00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:34,995","And we were always pretty savvy about getting our names on the box, you know, so we're, hey."
"00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:39,305","You know, you have to kind of act like you're famous before you're famous."
"00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,520",That sounds funny.
"00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,280",I learned that from an interview with David Lee Roth about Van Halen.
"00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:47,230",Like we always acted like we were hot shit.
"00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,145","We had a big hit, Full Throttle, it's called Full Throttle and it sold a million copies"
"00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:54,257",and that was really big for those PC graphic adventures.
"00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:58,941",And then I made a game called Grim Fandango and that won Game of the Year with Game Spot
"00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:01,347",and that was the big thing that helped a lot.
"00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:05,978","Grim Fandango is set in the Land of the Dead, yeah."
"00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:12,050","And it was, it sold about half a million units and it was seen as not being commercially successful."
"00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,792",And it was one of the reasons that adventure games died.
"00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:19,468","I mean, I heard a friend of mine, who worked in another game company, saying we tried to get an adventure game made"
"00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:23,350","and they said, well look, you know, Grim Fandango didn't do that well."
"00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,493","So obviously, you know, it was a good game, it won Game of the Year."
"00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:31,610","And if Game of the Year can't sell, you know, as many copies as it needs to, then maybe that genre's dead."
"00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:37,750",So I feel some responsibility to make a good game and make it do well.
"00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,180",Rice: He's been excited about it.
"00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,947","I mean, he's wanted to return to adventure games for a while and it's just been a matter of not knowing how to make that happen."
"00:03:46,947 --> 00:03:53,756","Schafer: But fans are always saying they would want, they want one, but a publisher would say, we can't make money doing those."
"00:03:53,756 --> 00:04:00,773","So something like Kickstarter shows up, which is this crowd sourcing website, where everybody can back a project."
"00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:06,310","You pitch your project and you get backers and then if you meet your goals, you get the money and you build your project."
"00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,468","Doing an adventure game is interesting, because it's the only, like the only way you could do that,"
"00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:14,319","letting the fans like, kind of put their money where their mouth is."
"00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,738",Is it that? Wait a second.
"00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:17,219",Did I get that backwards? Yeah.
"00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:18,267","Host: No, you're right. Yeah."
"00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:21,476","Some loud mouth fan, no, I don't want to buy Trenched, but what about an adventure game?"
"00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:23,541",Schafer: Exactly.
"00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,837",Shahani: Explain your Kickstarter campaign.
"00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:26,596",What have you just done?
"00:04:26,596 --> 00:04:29,676",Schafer: Yeah. What have we done?
"00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:31,835","Schafer: Oh, sorry. I didn't see you there."
"00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:35,184",You caught me indulging in one of my many impressive hobbies.
"00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:36,727",I'm Tim Schafer.
"00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:39,223",Schafer: And so we put a pitch video up where we said we want to make a game.
"00:04:39,223 --> 00:04:44,402","And the idea was, what if we made one of these adventure games that most publishers don't want to fund these days?"
"00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:47,380",And one of my favorite types of games to make is adventure games.
"00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,851","But these days, it seems like adventure games are almost a bit of a lost art form."
"00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:56,339",They exist in our dreams and our memories and in Germany.
"00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:00,872",Schafer: Maybe that would get people excited about getting a chance to do something that couldn't be funded any other way.
"00:05:00,872 --> 00:05:02,168",Schafer: It's perfect.
"00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,863",We got the perfect team here at Double Fine to make it.
"00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:06,386","We got the inventor of the genre here, Ron Gilbert."
"00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:08,668","Oh, look! There he is right now."
"00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:11,438",Maybe he'll help us.
"00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,920",He'll help us.
"00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:18,686","Gilbert: You know, we've always talked about wanting to do, you know, more classic adventure stuff."
"00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:24,665","And so doing the Kickstarter thing, it's like, yeah, that sounds, I mean, that sounds really like an interesting idea."
"00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:29,210",I think we were both very skeptical about the amount of money.
"00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:34,327","Schafer: So, we are asking for this much to make the game and this much to film it."
"00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:38,079","And that may seem like a lot of money, but it's really not that much for a game budget these days."
"00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,683","It's pretty small, actually."
"00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:43,496",Schafer: And I just never thought you could get the kind of money that would actually pay for a whole game budget.
"00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:45,715","Schafer: Hello, potential backers."
"00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:47,166",I could do all three options.
"00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,724",Thank you for donating well over the amount we asked for.
"00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,989",That's so great.
"00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:53,085",We have too much money now.
"00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:54,288",Damn you!
"00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,755",Why haven't anyone given us any money?
"00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:58,297",I'm so sad.
"00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:00,733",That doesn't seem believable.
"00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,265","Yeah, we're not going to use that one."
"00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:03,684","Or just moderately, hello."
"00:06:03,684 --> 00:06:07,013",Thank you for dedicating the appropriate amount of...
"00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:11,514","Schafer: Because the previous projects in Kickstarter had only been, I don't know what the maximum was before then,"
"00:06:11,514 --> 00:06:13,796",but it looked like they're like forty grand.
"00:06:13,796 --> 00:06:17,494","You know, I mean, we're used to making projects that were like, you know, BrÃ¼tal."
"00:06:17,494 --> 00:06:19,990","Like 20 million dollars and these smaller games, like two million."
"00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,733","It was like, no way you can get two million from Kickstarter."
"00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,031",Could you?
"00:06:24,031 --> 00:06:27,238","Schafer: I hope this works out, because it is kind of, that enough people got together,"
"00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:29,334",are they going to actually make a game like this happen?
"00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:34,760","A game like, that we haven't really been able to make happen for business reasons for like, many, many years."
"00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,934",Gilbert: Or we'll just prove all those publishers right.
"00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:41,784",Schafer: Or we'll just prove them all right.
"00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,247","Schafer: No, I mean nothing I had done before prepared me for what it's like to work with publishers."
"00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:14,259","Rice: When you're working with a publisher, a lot of times they get involved with design decisions."
"00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:16,816",And you have to make compromises.
"00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:23,229","Gilbert: You know, if a publisher is out there, from the outside kind of poking in and making you do things."
"00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:26,219","You know, that's where I think things can kind of come off the rails."
"00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:31,398","Schafer: And the way it felt, I don't know if this makes any sense, but my head, like the creative process of making a game was like,"
"00:07:31,398 --> 00:07:36,886","you look at a field of floating, multi-colored dots, drifting slowly to the ground."
"00:07:36,886 --> 00:07:40,587","And eventually when they hit the ground, they're going to make like a painting on the floor."
"00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:43,146","But you've got to kind of like move them around, give them the right and see."
"00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:50,081","And then as they fall, you start to see where you need more color and you move them around and slowly they settle and you just add a sound."
"00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:51,376",And then you're done.
"00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:54,212","So it'd be like, Tim, what do you do with that green dot?"
"00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:55,632","Phew, I can't tell you."
"00:07:55,632 --> 00:07:57,083","You're like, ok, that dot?"
"00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,131",Can we just nail that down here.
"00:07:58,131 --> 00:07:59,151",Can we just say what that's going to be?
"00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:00,200","And you're like, no."
"00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,558","So let's just say where all the red dots are going to be, ok."
"00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:02,823",Could you just nail all the red dots down?
"00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:03,996","Like, no!"
"00:08:03,996 --> 00:08:08,283","How about if we just start on this edge and we just take all the dots, like this and just nail all those dots."
"00:08:08,283 --> 00:08:09,546",No!
"00:08:09,546 --> 00:08:15,374","Rice: Yeah. The games industry as a whole, I think, is in a really weird spot where it's like we're,"
"00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:19,257",like the film industry used to be way back in the day.
"00:08:19,257 --> 00:08:21,909",Where the publishers are running mostly everything.
"00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:26,410",That's kind of how it was for a long time and it's only now that people are starting to like
"00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,175",seek out the creators of the games.
"00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:34,046",That people who are making the game and try to actually support those people and lift them up a bit.
"00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:38,197",Young Man: Because Tim Schafer has consistently put out quality games.
"00:08:38,197 --> 00:08:42,296",Man: Games that have very large and dedicated followings.
"00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:46,303",Man: People would probably pay him just to spit on their screen.
"00:08:46,303 --> 00:08:48,215",Young Man: And we do appreciate that.
"00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:51,020",We show our appreciation by doing what we've done.
"00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,243",By giving them the funding for this game in eight hours.
"00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,449",Rice: The whole like past month has been like a complete blur.
"00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:00,854",It's gone so quick.
"00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:05,447","But, yeah, we were in Vegas for DICE the day that we launched."
"00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:08,960","Schafer: And we'd had a hard month, because we had a game cancel."
"00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,616","The whole team, we're trying to figure out whether we could swing having this team stay on"
"00:09:13,616 --> 00:09:17,006",or do we have to let go of twelve people to keep the company afloat?
"00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:20,078",We've never laid off anyone for money before.
"00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:26,772","So we were, and even besides the financial concerns, it was just such a, it doesn't feel like you're winning when you have a game canceled."
"00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:30,532","You feel like it's a big, you know, you've lost."
"00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:33,677",Schafer: I'm about to launch our first Kickstarter project.
"00:09:33,677 --> 00:09:38,456","Rice: It kind of just all came together right when we were out there and we had a bit of time before a meeting and we're like,"
"00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:39,907",we could launch this today.
"00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:42,928","Schafer: Yeah, I did have to like decide, well, we'll launch our Kickstarter."
"00:09:42,928 --> 00:09:45,394","That, for time, we're like I guess $200,000."
"00:09:45,394 --> 00:09:47,305","We could make something for $200,000."
"00:09:47,305 --> 00:09:51,159","And I had to accept it, I might only get $200,000, right?"
"00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:54,550","And then when I was nervous about it, so I upped it to three, right."
"00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,002","And so it was like, yeah, we can make something for $300,000."
"00:09:58,002 --> 00:09:59,389",Because we could.
"00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:03,645","You know, we'd been talking about iPhone games recently and it's like three people for six months or something like that."
"00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,435","Yeah, we could make something with three people and six months."
"00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:11,581","It would look like a flash game or it'd look like an iPhone game, but it would technically be a game."
"00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:13,811",By all scientific definitions.
"00:10:13,811 --> 00:10:16,890",Schafer: I'm nervous.
"00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,400",Launch.
"00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,220","Review, i'll have to review it."
"00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,140","Rice: Oh, man. That was such a letdown!"
"00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,339","Schafer: OK. No, no, that's just fine print."
"00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,329",It's just that I never read these things.
"00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:33,471",Should I do it?
"00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:34,736","Rice: Yeah, do it."
"00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:36,464","Schafer: It couldn't hurt, right?"
"00:10:36,464 --> 00:10:38,067","Rice: It could, but we're not going to let it."
"00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:41,025",Schafer: Whoo!
"00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,374","Rice: I remember like as soon as we hit it up and we refresh, it was like at $30."
"00:10:45,374 --> 00:10:47,910","We're like, holy crap! There's already $30."
"00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,409","Schafer: I think I'm going to look at how much, I don't care about money."
"00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:55,405","I'm not going to look. I'm going to look, just one second."
"00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,688",Rice: What are we at?
"00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:59,911","OK, so we posted this, what? Two hours ago, right?"
"00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:01,504",Schafer: Two hours ago.
"00:11:01,504 --> 00:11:03,756",We launched our Kickstarter project two hours ago.
"00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:07,889","$106,000 in 56."
"00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:10,848","A hundred and six, I can't count so high."
"00:11:10,848 --> 00:11:12,976","It's such a high number, that's crazy."
"00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,918",It's too much money.
"00:11:14,918 --> 00:11:19,637","Rice: Yeah. So when we hit a million, that was definitely like, that was the day after."
"00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,427","One day after we launched, right?"
"00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:22,783",Rice: What are we at?
"00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:25,304",Schafer: I want to just say I love you guys and not for the money.
"00:11:25,304 --> 00:11:27,121","Offscreen: 999,700!"

"00:11:40,957 --> 00:11:43,360",Rice: What's the number?
"00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,780",Offscreen: Refresh! Refresh!
"00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,615",Min: The internet has crashed.

"00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,080",Muir: The Internet's crashed.

"00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,860",Are you guys ok? What happened?
"00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,677","Oh, they're being crushed. It's horrible."
"00:12:16,677 --> 00:12:19,737","Muir: Oh, no! No!"
"00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,480",What happened?
"00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,580",[Distortion] Muir: It's a million dollars!
"00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:28,233",Rice: Is it?
"00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:29,973",Muir: That's what a million dollars sounds like.
"00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,080",Offscreen: What do you mean it crashed?
"00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,100",Offscreen: Kickstarter crashed.

"00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:52,720","[Offscreen yelling] Rice: Yeah, that was definitely one of the high points,"
"00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:56,318","where it was like, holy crap -- This is a huge thing."
"00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:58,476",Muir: Whoo! A million in 24 hours.
"00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:00,853","Tim Schafer, you just made a million dollars in 24 hours!"

"00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:05,355",Schafer: Yeah! I got to make a game.
"00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:10,448","Newscaster: Over the last few days, Tim Schafer from Double Fine took crowd funding site, Kickstarter to fund his next game."
"00:13:10,448 --> 00:13:12,638",Schafer: It feels like a happening. You know what I mean?
"00:13:12,638 --> 00:13:14,241",Like it feels like an event.
"00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:16,401",Newscaster: They're raising money at a clip of a thousand dollars per minute.
"00:13:16,401 --> 00:13:17,697",It's incredible.
"00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,270",Host: One question that is on everybody's mind.
"00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,660",You get the million dollars.
"00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,541",Did you immediately withdraw it all?
"00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:26,055",Put it into a vault and then dive into it like Scrooge McDuck style?
"00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,602","Schafer: Then during Kickstarter, it made it, I don't know what it was,"
"00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:34,805",but it made everyone just take that big basket of money and shake it out over our heads.
"00:13:34,805 --> 00:13:38,100","It really was like the end of ""It's a Wonderful Life""."
"00:13:38,360 --> 00:14:00,320",[Music] Offscreen: So excited.
"00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,080",Offscreen: Thumbs up?
"00:14:04,347 --> 00:14:07,335","Man: Thumbs up, yes."
"00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,640",That was pretty amazing.
"00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,340","I told you, adventure games are not dead!"
"00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,512",The thing that I noticed was that it was just such a morale boost to the whole team.
"00:14:19,512 --> 00:14:25,123","And you know, I think it just felt like a lot of goodwill and love coming towards the company and everyone got super excited about it."
"00:14:25,123 --> 00:14:29,071","And because it was like this feeling of like, we knew those people were there, we knew they were."
"00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:31,199","But, because sometimes they don't show up when you make a game."
"00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,768","You know, you make a game, you release it, you know, like I thought it was going to sell a lot and it didn't."
"00:14:34,768 --> 00:14:39,025","You're like, where are all those people that it feels like, there's all this goodwill out there."
"00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:40,352",Man #1: It's two million.
"00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:43,189",Man #2: One of us has to stop shaving.
"00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:47,622",Man #2: He has to shave my scrotum if it gets to two million.
"00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,840",Man #1: Only if he agrees to do it on camera.
"00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:54,193",Offscreen: Congratulations.
"00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:57,586",Schafer: It had been a long time since we had experience where it felt like we were the winners.
"00:14:57,586 --> 00:15:03,959","We were at DICE and I was walking through DICE, feeling like a winner, which is really kind of like,"
"00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:11,539","not that I feel like a loser, but usually feel like the alternative, alternative to money."
"00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,377","I mean i'm proud of all our games and I wouldn't switch them with anyone else's games,"
"00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:27,233","but usually walking in a convention like that, you're talking to the, you know, the people who made Uncharted"
"00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:29,146","and they're, they're really nice and you're like, ah."
"00:15:29,146 --> 00:15:30,780",Congratulations on the game.
"00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,323",Did really well for you.
"00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:38,767","And like, you don't often feel like, you feel like they're like the family member who's like still living at home."
"00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:40,217","You know, like yeah."
"00:15:40,217 --> 00:15:44,838","They're all really nice to us, but you know, we haven't, it's different when you make a bunch of money."
"00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:47,922",Schafer: And we raised 1.7 million dollars on Kickstarter.
"00:15:47,922 --> 00:15:52,980",[Applause] Schafer: Is that auto refreshing?
"00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,480",Everyone: Yes.
"00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,572","Schafer: We were in the hotel room and I was listening on the Skype, on the iPad"
"00:15:56,572 --> 00:16:02,611","and you just remember like, click, click, aha, aha, then all of a sudden, whooo!"
"00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,980",Schafer: Distortion sound as everyone lost their shit.
"00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,920",And right now we're at almost 2.5 million dollars.
"00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:10,066",and we have six more days to go.
"00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:13,243","Rice, Offscreen: Everything moved really quickly and I actually didn't really have a chance"
"00:16:13,243 --> 00:16:17,066","to like let everything sit in until yesterday, when it finished."
"00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:21,073","And I was like, finally it like hit me and it was like, holy crap."
"00:16:21,073 --> 00:16:24,615",We did something really crazy here.
"00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,380",Schafer: 2 minutes!
"00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:35,080",[Crowd shouting and cheering] So like we cleared in advance
"00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,400",I'm going to shake this up and I'm going to spray it all over your head.
"00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:41,554",Why is that...
"00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,940",Ron!
"00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:45,309","My God, that's terrible for your teeth."
"00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:46,020",Offscreen: Two minutes!
"00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,280",Two minutes.
"00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:54,960",[Pop] Offscreen: Premature! Premature!
"00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:01,272","Gilbert: There's still a part of my skeptical pessimistic brain that says, well, you can never do this again."
"00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:06,079",That this was really kind of this one time perfect storm thing.
"00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,114","But I don't know. I mean, maybe not."
"00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:31,520",[Music] [Cheering]
"00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,515","I've been so happy about that ever since Kickstarter started,"
"00:17:35,515 --> 00:17:37,672","just thinking about how, I still have to answer to people."
"00:17:37,672 --> 00:17:39,646","Like people funded the game, you know."
"00:17:39,646 --> 00:17:41,827",But they're exactly the people I want to answer to.
"00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,864","Those are the people I'm making dots for, right?"
"00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:50,544","And all those things like, and so it's like, it's just this really liberating,"
"00:17:50,544 --> 00:17:54,615","freeing thing to just think that I'm just going to have to worry about how good the game is, almost nothing else."
"00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:05,240",[Music] Schafer: I love you guys!
"00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,599",It has been an amazing experience. So much love.
"00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:13,747","We know there's not, it's not all about us and Double Fine, but about you, the fans and what you guys want to say"
"00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:15,939",and do with your money and choose to do.
"00:18:15,939 --> 00:18:18,375",And make things happen for yourself.
"00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:22,785","I mean, I don't want to make a huge speech here, because I'll be all choked up."
"00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:24,779",Gilbert: Too late.
"00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:29,837","Schafer: But I just, I don't want to say this is the end of the, you know, the whole game industry as we know it."
"00:18:29,837 --> 00:18:32,857","It's not, it's not."
"00:18:32,857 --> 00:18:37,824","And it's not, again it's not like we're total replacement of all publishers and publishing games."
"00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:41,803","There's still going to be, there still might be a few games made by publishers after today."
"00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:43,746",Just a couple games.
"00:18:43,746 --> 00:18:48,988","But it does mean if you've ever been told that your part of a niche market, if you've ever like, if you've ever like,"
"00:18:48,988 --> 00:18:52,658",when you're a kid and you had your favorite TV show cancelled or you hear about your favorite band
"00:18:52,658 --> 00:18:56,576",being dropped by their label for not selling enough and you've just been like why does a big company get to choose
"00:18:56,576 --> 00:19:00,924","what music I listen to or what movies I watch or what TV shows I watch or what game I get to play,"
"00:19:00,924 --> 00:19:04,377",now you know that they can't do that anymore.
"00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,784",You can choose. So thanks everybody.
"00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:12,940",[Cheering] Thank you to the team!
"00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,260",Everybody!
"00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,335",Thanks to my parents for backing the project and everybody else's parents who backed the project.
"00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:24,939",Does anybody else want to thank anybody?
"00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,120",Kipnis: Thank you Tim!
"00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,220",Thank you!
"00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:30,984",Thanks everyone and now we dance.
