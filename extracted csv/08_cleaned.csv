"00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,459","[Buzzing noise] [Schafer laughing]"
"00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,940","Schafer: Oh my god."
"00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,460","Schafer: There you go."
"00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,900","Schafer: I forgot to put my beard on this morning, you're right."
"00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,620","I left that beard at home."
"00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,440","People are going to know it's a fake beard."
"00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,782","Rice: I think that it's also just important to keep in mind that there's like other impacts besides just funding the game and that"
"00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:14,332","like if we now go get a publisher for this game, then it's suddenly like voids everything we've said about the project"
"00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:15,612","and everything we're trying to do."
"00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,300","Schafer: Where did we leave off?"
"00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,635","Oh, that's right."
"00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,680","Game was too big, company's going to close down, didn't have any money and Cloud Colony wasn't done."
"00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,723","Bailey: Like because right now, you know, it looks like the plane's kind of diving down a little bit"
"00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,690","and we just need to, we have time to pull up."
"00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:35,045","Schafer: What does the plane diving down stand for?"
"00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,843","Bailey: That stands for Schafer: Us crashing?"
"00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,520","Schafer: The whole company crashing into the ground and burning? Bailey: [laughing] Rice: A lot actually."
"00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,180","Well, I mean right after that episode aired, yeah, right after that episode aired we started Amnesia Fortnight"
"00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,960","so the team kind of took a break from everything for a little bit there."
"00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,590","Schafer: Amnesia Fortnight is coming up, people."
"00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,260","And you forget what we were working on for two weeks, that's where the name comes from."
"00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,634","We split the company into small groups, sometimes four or five groups."
"00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,946","And each group has to make a game in two weeks."
"00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,371","Rice: I think ultimately that was an amazing process and people had a great time and just came back really energized after that."
"00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:12,352","And a lot of progress has already been made in this month since then."
"00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:20,723","Things are definitely moving along quicker and we're starting to address a lot of potential ways to help make production go smoothly"
"00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,963","and on a lower budget than it's looking like it could."
"00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,655","Schafer: There's scope and then there's money, then there's efficiencies."
"00:02:29,718 --> 00:02:33,538","And I've never seen this solved any other way than all of the above."
"00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,900","Stamos: Yeah. Schafer: You know what I mean?"
"00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,460","Some scope reduction, some efficiency improvements, some extra money."
"00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,380","We've been working on simplifying some stuff."
"00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,025","J.P.'s come on and we've been trying to look at things in the spaceship we can simplify."
"00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:47,125","We cut some room, cut the teleporter rooms, cut some simple stuff."
"00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:51,445","But it's more like an ongoing thing, simplifying it as we go."
"00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,552","You know, you want to make the game, most of the backers I think would be unanimous in saying they want a great game, right?"
"00:02:57,555 --> 00:03:04,372","So they're trusting me to use the judgment of like how much to cut that still makes it a great game."
"00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,226","And they don't want us to cut more than that, so we just have to, we've been working on that problem."
"00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,340","Bailey: I'm not privy to what's actually going on in the scoping side right now."
"00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,622","Although I hear that they're, they're making some progress."
"00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:25,967","On the funding side I was able to bring in a few deals that don't require any kind of creative control."
"00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:35,455","So like Brutal Legend PC, which to me is potentially, you know, better on PC than it would be on console, because it's an RTS."
"00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:37,161","It has RTS elements."
"00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:41,988","It's never actually been released and it's got, you know, huge amount of music already licensed in it"
"00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:48,529","So we moved that up and you know, we're looking to release that pretty soon."
"00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:53,698","And all or, no, some or all of those profits will probably go back to Red's."
"00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,627","Schafer: I mean...for one of our other games, he found a licensing deal in Korea"
"00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,269","So there's extra money and revenue that can come in through that."
"00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:07,409","And that's the kind of stuff I would never have, I can't whip up a Korean licensing deal on my own, I'd have no idea."
"00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,080","How do you, who do you even call? Do you know any-?"
"00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:16,914","We got such a response to Majus's print from the last episode that we can now, now selling the print."
"00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:21,654","Each one is a new line of dialogue that I can put in the game, so think about it that way."
"00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,577","Bailey: I don't know how much money is actually going to be enough."
"00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,580","So for me, like my mandate is more."
"00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,800","Because I want Tim to be able to completely check out and when he feels the game's done, then it's done."
"00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,580","Stamos: New addition to my office."
"00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,440","It's pretty exciting."
"00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,160","There's nothing much on it yet."
"00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,900","Oh, except there's a red milestone right there."
"00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,081","I want to see how that goes."
"00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:51,871","We're working on all kinds of things throughout the whole studio."
"00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:58,120","But when it comes to Red's we're I come in as more of a ""how can we control costs?"""
"00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,140","Hansen: This still is adding up to six and a half months of tech work so [laughing] we gotta find out."
"00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,418","Franzke: Oh that's just even split across all the ..."
"00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:12,380","Hanson: Well it was eight and a half months before Franzke: But that actually makes sense to me, that this is kind of like a relief [laughs]."
"00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:18,960","Stamos: More, more needs to be done to really understand what's left to do and how long that will take."
"00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,440","Really like kind of refactoring all of our assumptions about that schedule."
"00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,500","Really I think getting some project management attention on it."
"00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:39,440","Matt Hansen coming in and working on that uber-schedule so we can really plan out what's happening a little bit more down the road."
"00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,578","Hansen: Obviously Greg's already the producer on the project."
"00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:48,061","But you know, it's super-important for the studio, really important for us."
"00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,360","And you know, it's one of our completely self-funded projects so it's one of the things where it did make sense"
"00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,640","to bring on additional production help to make sure that we're, we're running as effectively and efficiently as possible."
"00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:09,500","I have some expertise from working in adventure games in the past so I think that's something they wanted to bring onto the team"
"00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,140","to help make it go smoothly as possible."
"00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:20,102","I'm actually pulling a lot from my experiences on those games to understand how to schedule the game, scope it properly and stuff like that."
"00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,920","Hansen: I still have this remote deployment harness as something I'm going to have to talk to Tim about."
"00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,000","I really want to push forward on that."
"00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,157","I think it's going to be really helpful for debugging the game later on."
"00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,700","Franzke: I agree."
"00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:35,856","Otherwise we're just going to shoot ourselves in the foot. Hansen: Yeah."
"00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,200","Rice: And yeah, it's been helpful."
"00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:43,295","I think it's just like , it's nice to be able to kind of hand it off to him and kind of get ahead of things a little bit."
"00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:45,185","It's going to be really helpful."
"00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:50,680","Hansen: Developing an engine and a game at the same time, it's always been a challenge for a lot of different games."
"00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,392","You'll hear that as a common story for a lot of games where they're, you know, it's like, Limbo's a good example,"
"00:06:56,392 --> 00:07:00,038","where they were trying to develop the engine for Limbo, they're also trying to create the game at the same time."
"00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:01,498","It's huge, hugely challenging."
"00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:03,173","Hansen: All right. That's it."
"00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:03,933","Thank you very much."
"00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,918","I'll start laying this out and then let's talk about maybe later."
"00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,520","Franzke: Yep. Hansen: Later next week. Thanks a lot."
"00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:15,699","Stamos: So that's been huge. I think that having additional gameplay programmers added to the team,"
"00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,020","but who have design experience, that that's probably helping."
"00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,960","Rice: Yeah, we just added a handful of people to the team, kind of staffing up a bit."
"00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,900","And it was people that were on The Cave and that just shipped a few weeks ago."
"00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,420","[Applause] Gilbert: Well, we shipped The Cave."
"00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:41,200","[Cheering] Gilbert: On 742 platforms, so that's good news."
"00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,860","Anyway, I just, you know, a toast to everybody and they just did an amazing job on The Cave."
"00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,000","Group: Cheers!"
"00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,860","And now what you have all really been waiting for, cake."
"00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,260","Group: [laughs] Schafer: Scoop it up with his hands"
"00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,360","Put it in everyone's mouth Line up."
"00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:07,965","Rice: And so they just are wrapping up their final tasks and bug fixes for that And as they become available, we're just trying to figure out"
"00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:12,804","what makes the most sense for him to be working on and right now that is Reds."
"00:08:12,804 --> 00:08:22,775","So we've got someone from every discipline added to the team and kind of helping to lighten people's loads and add some extra manpower to the game."
"00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,340","Schafer: Everyone's here, OK. Awesome."
"00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,300","Dailies. Film crew's back."
"00:08:28,302 --> 00:08:29,367","Not that you notice."
"00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:35,193","I'm sure you guys are all, for those of you who have not ever been filmed before, if you ignore them, really,"
"00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:38,239","They'll just, they'll catch you picking your nose."
"00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,220","Rice: We're too big now. I don't know how they're going to do this."
"00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,000","Schafer: I know, look how huge we are."
"00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,900","Let's get this over with. OK."
"00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,280","Yesterday I was going to write those last three things for the Cloud Colony, but I did a whole bunch of other project review stuff."
"00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,720","LeBreton: It was pretty easy to pick up on, you know."
"00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,599","Anna was teaching me a whole bunch about the systems that she wrote on the game play,"
"00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,540","which is mainly what I've been working with."
"00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:04,804","Just figuring out how, how dialogue, I've been, a lot of my work has been wiring up the dialogue trees, you know."
"00:09:04,804 --> 00:09:11,330","We got the writing from Tim and then we got scratch VO, so I wired that up so you can pick, ""tell me more"""
"00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:17,560","or ""what about this"" or ""see you later."" Thomas: I guess you're better at spotting fakes than the other birds."
"00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,560","Hey, can you take me here to my home?"
"00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,100","You can? Great!"
"00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,524","Ever seen this place? Great."
"00:09:29,524 --> 00:09:31,153","Can you take me there right now?"
"00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,755","LeBreton: I enjoy all phases of a project."
"00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,459","You know, if it's a good project then it's fun to be in on the early inception where you're getting to like, you know,"
"00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,778","help really make big important creative decisions."
"00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,640","It's fun to be in the middle where you're producing stuff, you know, you're building it"
"00:09:44,648 --> 00:09:49,104","and eventually hit that critical mass where it's like, yes, we have a game now; we know what we're building."
"00:09:49,104 --> 00:09:55,531","And then late in the game, if you're not, you know, if you're not stressing out too much about like, you know,"
"00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:59,628","fires that you have to put out, it's really fun to like see the last few steps come together"
"00:09:59,628 --> 00:10:02,531","and really feel like some, like you're putting polish on something."
"00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,459","So all of those are cool."
"00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:08,047","But yeah, I think we're very much in the middle."
"00:10:08,047 --> 00:10:10,147","We're kind of like in the early middle in this."
"00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:13,440","So yeah, no."
"00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,007","And I've worked, you know, I've, yeah, I've led stuff before but also just been in the trenches guy."
"00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:26,888","So you know, depends, again, if it's a good project, then I'll enjoy, and I can contribute something substantial to it."
"00:10:26,888 --> 00:10:28,928","That's all I really care about."
"00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,211","Garner: It was on budget, on time; everything was great."
"00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,514","You're going to, you're going to go home early, no overtime."
"00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,900","Then I saw Episode 7 and I was like, aha."
"00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,620","Just the normal stuff."
"00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:54,400","They were just like, would you be interested in DFA, Tim wants you on that project so bad."
"00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,900","He's always talking about Dave being in on the project."
"00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,766","Schafer: We got Dave Garner, famous fan of Ico and Shadow of the Colossus."
"00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,060","Garner: That shit is so awesome."
"00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,875","Schafer: And adventure games."
"00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,080","Yes, Garner's here because adventure games are not dead."
"00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,867","Garner: Adventure games are not dead."
"00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:18,313","Garner: When I came on, I initially, like the characters have so much style in them."
"00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,111","The first thing that I thought about was like, I'm just going to like focus on animating real subtle stuff"
"00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,432","and like focus on the face and like focus on the eyes."
"00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,072","That stuff's important in like films and stuff but we don't usually do that stuff in games."
"00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,700","But I feel like that's one of the things that we want to try to do with this one."
"00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,166","Garner: This is when we were experimenting with like, you know, what kind of an attitude should he have?"
"00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:44,558","Like sort of blank look on his face, that's like kind of bored because he's on the ship and getting sick of this stuff."
"00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:51,904","And he's got like, you know, his idles would be like, he's just like, overall he's not too stoked on all the stuff that's going on, on the ship."
"00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:57,281","But then when you start playing with him and explore, like we were saying it'll start getting really cool"
"00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,401","when he's just going to be like, oh my God!"
"00:11:58,401 --> 00:11:59,160","This is awesome!"
"00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:05,030","A lot of people aren't really going to notice that, but like, hopeful some person is like, oh yeah, that's really cool."
"00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:11,451","Like that boy, like I've seen him change throughout the game, which is not something not I've really done with a character in a game before."
"00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:18,704","Is like have them go from, you know, one character type and, like actually end the hero's journey having gone through it,"
"00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,202","make, you know, an emotional journey as well."
"00:12:21,202 --> 00:12:23,562","Which is something you see in movies, just not so much in games."
"00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,600","Schafer: Who else got added?"
"00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,466","We got Lydia."
"00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:26,556","We've had Lydia for a little while."
"00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,211","Lydia's a great effects artist, technical artist."
"00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,934","Does a little programming on the side."
"00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,780","Small teams, everyone has to do a bunch of stuff."
"00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:39,659","Choy: Generally I just go through and just try to add things wherever I can, because like with this Cloud Colony."
"00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:45,869","The more, the more there's like little support ambient effects, the more alive it feels."
"00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,340","Schafer: I think this ground looks so pretty now."
"00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,180","And the little dust, and the poofs and everything."
"00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,331","And look at that thing up there!"
"00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,887","What's happening up there?"
"00:12:56,887 --> 00:12:58,075","Is that 3D?"
"00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,656","Petty: Well, it's an old PlaysStation One trick."
"00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,340","We just took the texture and put it on crisscross polygons."
"00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,060","And just spun it around in 3D."
"00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,200","Schafer: Oh now I hate it."
"00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,355","Now that I know."
"00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,880","Cheating, now I hate it."
"00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,520","It looks amazing."
"00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,204","Melian: So here's like a new thing we're trying out."
"00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,340","It's actually using a 3D, a 3D element."
"00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,984","And you'll see it again."
"00:13:19,286 --> 00:13:21,006","So we're experimenting with that now."
"00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,436","Melian: I think so. I think that's the idea."
"00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,415","If we can get these 3D elements working and kind of blending in there without popping out too much, I think that's the idea."
"00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,600","And we'll go in and try to do that more and more."
"00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,000","Schafer: Whoa color!"
"00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,340","Oh there's a mom!"
"00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,860","Hey, hi, mom."
"00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,720","She's got hair that comes off of the crystal ball."
"00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:50,308","Peck: I guess last week was like really my first time, my first week where like I really got to spend like a lot of my time on Red's."
"00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:51,208","Really fun."
"00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:57,246","Basically Lee's been working really hard getting the environment white boxed so you can actually just walk around."
"00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:05,780","And I'm just following behind him wiring up the basic puzzle structure as it comes in."
"00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,372","Yeah, this is the first piece of color art we've got on this."
"00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,131","Like a rough color."
"00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,280","But still amazing."
"00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:20,209","It really reminds me of like, you have a giant art book, like hard cover picture book in front of you"
"00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:24,786","and just like turning the page and being really immersed in the art."
"00:14:24,786 --> 00:14:34,101","Like you know, with the old pixel-based adventure games, they didn't have like this camera flowing over things"
"00:14:34,101 --> 00:14:36,141","and zooming in and panning out as much."
"00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,400","And this really feels like I'm being like guided through this, this really beautiful experience."
"00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:50,900","So that's what's really captured my imagination so far, is like this story is just being presented in such a beautiful way."
"00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,400","I'm really excited to see like where, how far we can push that."
"00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,143","Peck: Let me just load up a certain level accepting."
"00:15:00,143 --> 00:15:02,742","Yeah, I'll open up the galley. Yeah."
"00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:05,882","Yeah, the bedroom and the galley have the rough color."
"00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,620","It's amazing. It's like super cool."
"00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,180","Look how rough this is, but there's still this like epic scale."
"00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:19,035","You know, you're supposed to be floating out in space in a space suit, but everything but man."
"00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,052","This really blew me away when I saw that. So yeah."
"00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:28,680","I'm excited to talk to Bagel when he comes in and be like, awesome job, man."
"00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,420","Stapley: So yeah, I guess lightings down here and just try to tie it a little in with that one."
"00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,220","I feel like these are, I mean they're not totally different."
"00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,798","This color, I kinda like this being more white."
"00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,247","I feel like this is a little too orange."
"00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,907","I mean, I guess it's just the orange light, but still, yeah."
"00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:55,387","Maybe a little bit more yellow."
"00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,340","Hey, Tim. I'll get him later. I say go for it."
"00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,060","Brand: It's a really good learning experience."
"00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,640","I really like Bagel's style."
"00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,754","Yeah, he drew like a really awesome style guide that might pretty up the different areas of the ship."
"00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,940","You know, the vibe each one should give off and like the color palettes."
"00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,880","And a lot of the references he was using to derive that look."
"00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:22,541","So like the player living area, utility area and then there's an off-limits area for later in the game."
"00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:30,924","He took that and then did the, some even more like specific breakdowns with just a bunch of inspirational windows"
"00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:33,959","that, with those shapes and colors that he likes."
"00:16:34,241 --> 00:16:35,738","Stapley: I always go to orange."
"00:16:35,738 --> 00:16:38,958","Orange and brown and red is like shit that I always fucking do."
"00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,180","I mean, I feel like, I mean it's a little crutch that I have."
"00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,200","Not a crutch but it's like my go-to color."
"00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,180","All the time."
"00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,140","But yeah man."
"00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,360","You can nail it."
"00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,518","Stapley: Your colors are awesome."
"00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:00,839","Rice: And I'm excited to see the space stuff starting to come together, too, because Tim just delivered the dialogue for the boy's,"
"00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,963","like first segment of the game and it's amazing."
"00:17:03,963 --> 00:17:04,983","It's hilarious."
"00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,963","And you can so easily see how fun it's going to be to play through."
"00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:10,583","Rice: Yeah, but like reading through it, I don't see any holes."
"00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,903","Like I feel like, Schafer: It's fucking perfect."
"00:17:12,903 --> 00:17:17,198","Rice: I feel like the game play programmer could script that all up now without needing any questions, which is awesome."
"00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,760","Schafer: So no questions will be allowed."
"00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:42,320","Schafer: I think spaceship boy's stuff is easier, like the basic setup of it leads it to, it's funny because it's just, there's more humor in it."
"00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,278","And you would think you could just make everything funny equally but like the boy stuff's just naturally funnier"
"00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,213","because he's all alone with his mom, the tension between him and his mom"
"00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,280","and all the little robots and all the silly scenes he finds himself in."
"00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,420","I have to figure out something for the girl's world that makes it that easy to put, to put jokes in there."
"00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:03,198","Here's a picture of the climax of the game."
"00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,140","Do you want to see my pictures?"
"00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,454","Total spoiler right there."
"00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,520","Can you see that?"
"00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,090","Stamos: Yeah, I think that the change that I've seen the most is Tim, you know, absolutely."
"00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:17,030","Because he, he seems really motivated to kind of get things going."
"00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:21,974","And also he's, he's getting really close to the point of the entire game's designed out."
"00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,080","And I think that will be a big, pretty big milestone."
"00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:30,280","[Juicer whirs on] [Whooshing]"
"00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,560","[Tim whistling] [Whooshing]"
"00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,680","Schafer: Lemon."
"00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,960","[Wet grinding] Schafer: The juice fast is all part of, you know,"
"00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,840","when New Year's comes around you make a bunch of resolutions."
"00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,941","And it's, my resolution was not to die before my daughter got in college."
"00:18:48,523 --> 00:18:53,577","And also watching this documentary and seeing my gut enter the room like five minutes before I did."
"00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,520","It was just like, ah, got to do something about that."
"00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,877","So now I look all shrunken and my neck's all wiggly."
"00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,624","So you just can't win."
"00:19:00,624 --> 00:19:03,204","You just can't win and I got a gallstone probably, so."
"00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:05,804","Just lose, lose scenario, documentaries."
"00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,364","[Whooshing slows down] Schafer: I need a glass. Did anyone else want juice?"
"00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,280","Schafer: Yeah. I used to get a lot more sleepy in the afternoons and I don't know if that's coffee or that's just being super fat."
"00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,000","Schafer: Alright. Pack up some juice to take with me."
"00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,900","Cheers."
"00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,673","How much weight did I lose while I was drinking that?"
"00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,320","Did you notice?"
"00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,020","You see like shrinkage? Like, blugh."
"00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,946","Schafer: According to the Internet, I'm like 230 right now."
"00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,803","Schafer: Like one site said my weight should be 160 pounds."
"00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,300","And I started this at 260."
"00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,600","So I'm down 30 pounds."
"00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,420","Daughter: What?"
"00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,968","Schafer: You get to come shave off my beard."
"00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:57,668","Daughter: Papa, I don't know how to shave."
"00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,140","Schafer: Well, there's a time in every girl's life when she needs to learn how to shave."
"00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,120","Schafer: Here we go. Here we go."
"00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,933","[Buzzing] I'm really not going to do it."
"00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,000","I'm not going to do it. This is terrible."
"00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,620","This is a horrible mistake. Look at that."
"00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,124","Schafer: I used to just grow a beard every Christmas, like a Christmas beard, it'd start around Thanksgiving."
"00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,900","Ray got me started on that."
"00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:24,772","And then one year I grew the Christmas beard and I gained so much weight while I had it on that when I went to shave it off, I was like holy crap!"
"00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,780","Where was all this hiding?"
"00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,119","And then I was like, I'm going grow it back."
"00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,350","'Cause you actually believe that if you grow a beard, you can totally hide the fact that you're fat."
"00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,897","No one will figure it out."
"00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,209","I didn't mean to look at the people with beards when I said that."
"00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:37,927","And as, like when I get down to that weight again, I'll shave it off."
"00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:38,587","And so I shaved it off."
"00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000","Schafer: I feel really dumb with this."
"00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,579","Try to get respect in a meeting."
"00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,540","I think here's a new design, you guys."
"00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,660","[Laughter offscreen] [Buzzing]"
"00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,640","This is now, this is my look from like the '90s."
"00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,180","It was most of '90s."
"00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,560","I'm going to go all the way, you guys."
"00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,820","Schafer: If you think about it, the car is just a metaphor for my body."
"00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:22,688","They're both essentially really good looking, but they've been, you know, neglected a little bit over the years."
"00:21:22,688 --> 00:21:24,068","It's got some scratches."
"00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,700","There's a big knife hole in the top of it, just like me."
"00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,820","It's a little rusty."
"00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,300","It doesn't start in the morning."
"00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,120","It's full of gas."
"00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,330","Etcetera, etcetera."
"00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,917","And my car is something that I've been like just looking at, I should really take care of that eventually."
"00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,425","Kind of like, like, ah, I should really lose this weight eventually."
"00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:50,096","So I tweeted like anyone know a good mechanic?"
"00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:57,102","And of course, John Romero and Brenda Romero, like we have this guy who's perfect for a MoPar, which is what my Barracuda is."
"00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,322","And I went down there and John showed up."
"00:22:00,322 --> 00:22:02,345","And of course I'm all excited about getting my car fixed."
"00:22:02,345 --> 00:22:08,586","And then John pulls up in this amazing like, pretty much a brand-new, like Road Runner, like '68, '69 Road Runner."
"00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,285","And it's all shiny."
"00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:12,780","The engine is cleaner than anything in my house."
"00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,042","Like you could eat off it."
"00:22:14,277 --> 00:22:15,377","It's beautiful."
"00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,570","And my car's sitting there all sad."
"00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,000","Schafer: My sad old car."
"00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,600","Schafer: Which brings out a whole bunch of different issues for me."
"00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,993","Like why aren't I rich like John Romero?"
"00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,607","Next year I'll get on that."
"00:22:30,607 --> 00:22:32,325","This year I'm just going to get the car fixed."
"00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:38,580","And I started feeling the money flow out of my body as the guy was talking about all the work he wanted to do on it."
"00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,800","Schafer: How expensive is this going to be? I just want to get it running."
"00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,720","Schafer: So I need this game to be a hit to get out of the debt I'm going to accrue by getting that car running again."
"00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,791","[Engine roars] Schafer: I think the situation with our cars"
"00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,640","really shows our levels of financial success in the industry."
"00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,520","Schafer: And then John took me for the most terrifying drive of my life."
"00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,660","[Engine accelerates] Schafer: Jesus Christ!"
"00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:15,363","[Romero laughs] Schafer: It was like, in the car, he hit the gas and it felt like,"
"00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:17,883","like a sledge hammer just punched in the back of my neck."
"00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,820","Just snapped back like Aaaagghh!"
"00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,811","[Engine roar; screaming] And then John's driving."
"00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,000","I'm sure John is a really good driver, but I'm not 100 percent sure about that."
"00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:45,620","[Engine roar] Schafer: I thought I was gonna die."
"00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,360","Romero: Yeah! [Laughs] Thanks for the ride, John."
"00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,760","[Booing; Jeers] Offscreen: Who are you?"
"00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,000","Offscreen: Looks like a baby!"
"00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,478","Schafer: All right. I know I don't have the authority anymore."
"00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,899","Just look at me."
"00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,120","You'll get used to it."
"00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,315","Schafer: I shaved the beard, I'm on a diet."
"00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,141","Fixed the car."
"00:24:08,141 --> 00:24:09,682","I'm getting my writing done."
"00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:13,302","It's just a new, all new me."
"00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,640","For a couple months."
"00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,560","Then i'll just go back."
"00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:25,015","Schafer: Red's. Let go to projects. Red's, We finished the sprint on Friday and we're now looking at the build"
"00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:30,606","and trying to see how we get ready to actually play-test and maybe a HOF-style play-test with you guys."
"00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,020","Who would like to do that."
"00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,289","Maybe even, well, soon. Soon."
"00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:37,664","Let's just say soon."
"00:24:37,664 --> 00:24:39,533","Rice: That stands for Hour of Fun."
"00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,180","It's something that's been happening here at Double Fine for a long time."
"00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,018","Schafer: All right. Everyone excited about the HOF?"
"00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,960","First HOF."
"00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,440","Who's new, raise your hand, if you've never been in a HOF?"
"00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,500","So you've all done HOFs before."
"00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,807","Let me tell you about the Hour of Fun."
"00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:01,791","Schafer: So way back on Psychonauts, we found a lot of people had not played the game, like some of the animators had never booted up and played it."
"00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,480","I was like, how are we going to understand our game unless everybody plays it?"
"00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,289","So we had the mandatory Hour of Fun on a Friday."
"00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:10,224","Everybody had to stop working and play the game for an hour."
"00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:14,288","And then we did this thing where we met afterwards and be like, ask everybody what they thought."
"00:25:14,288 --> 00:25:20,057","And it was really terrifying that people actually talked about it, but really good because we got a lot of good feedback."
"00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,650","And so we did it all through Brutal."
"00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:25,346","We'd play the game and then everybody would just get to say whatever they felt about it."
"00:25:25,346 --> 00:25:31,138","Schafer: When you're milling around, talking to people, try not to, we try to not to influence people too much when they're playing the game,"
"00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:37,092","because we'd really like to get, I think the most important feedback is getting people to talk about what they're trying to do,"
"00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:42,077","because that's the stuff you miss in adventure games a lot, is like they're dragging this object that doesn't make any sense."
"00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,732","And they're like oh, well, 'cause everyone knows the bananas are flammable; I'm just putting them in, like oh God."
"00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,847","Like we never thought of that."
"00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:51,178","So catching what people are trying to do, getting them talking out loud is really good."
"00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:59,547","For the most part just watching, observing people and just, we don't, just try not to, there's a tendency you want to explain, like oh my God!"
"00:25:59,547 --> 00:26:01,765","That's, that's going to be much better when you play."
"00:26:01,765 --> 00:26:02,725","Don't worry about that, that's going to be really great."
"00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:03,963","Just don't even bother with that."
"00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:08,886","Just let them, let them hate the game, 'cause you know, the next HOF they'll be like, oh my God, you got so much more improvements in."
"00:26:08,886 --> 00:26:10,627","It was great. OK."
"00:26:10,627 --> 00:26:12,644","This is going to be exciting. Whoo."
"00:26:12,644 --> 00:26:19,660","Schafer: Everybody will be playing the game and then meeting afterwards to say, I don't like this game."
"00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,781","Or I love this game."
"00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:27,303","Then we'll also have an anonymous survey where people can say I just don't like Tim, whatever."
"00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,660","Rice: So we're going to be doing that on the Cloud Colony this afternoon."
"00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,425","We've been working to kind of polish that level up a bit and get a lot of the details in there"
"00:26:36,425 --> 00:26:40,250","that a first time player would need to be able to understand what's going on."
"00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:47,822","Franzke: So the main things that we need, just make it playable like, can you basically go through the entire Cloud Colony"
"00:26:47,822 --> 00:26:51,382","without needing to load, reload the game and stuff like that."
"00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,171","Well, the major things that I am focused on is mostly crashes."
"00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:01,040","Really, it's kind of anything that seriously goes wrong under the hood where stuff just falls over and dies."
"00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:08,580","And it's good we got test support last week a little bit, so finally testers playing the game."
"00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,402","And looking at stuff and they find things which is good."
"00:27:11,402 --> 00:27:13,782","And then we can go in and fix those hopefully."
"00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,188","Rice: Yeah, we finally testers on the game."
"00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:21,460","So they've been, you know, finding bugs and putting them in our bug database for us to fix."
"00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:30,380","Lo: Before I started working as a tester, I would basically spend eight hours a day playing video games every day."
"00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:37,073","And now that it's my job, I come home and I'm like, I still look at a computer monitor"
"00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,291","but I like, I don't really feel like playing games that even, that I've been excited for."
"00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,570","In fact, I think it actually made me less excited for certain games."
"00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:53,480","I'm only excited for like games that I really love, whereas before I was like, oh, I kind of like that game."
"00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,827","I might buy it."
"00:27:54,827 --> 00:27:55,627","And I'll play it."
"00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,681","It actually made me more selective of the games that I would actually beat nowadays."
"00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,420","And it takes a lot for a game for me to actually complete it now."
"00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,020","So yeah."
"00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,460","But before there was an issue where you pick up the ladder from that kid, and then you pick up the egg."
"00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,640","There would be, it would just crash the game for some reason."
"00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,840","There's that."
"00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,440","She just shoots in the top of ladder."
"00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,120","She doesn't have any pupils for some reason."
"00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:33,840","Franzke: Very often it's like, like a big shaky house in the way like if you push it at the wrong place it would fall over."
"00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,360","Just the way it is."
"00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,160","But yeah."
"00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:42,845","The trick is to find, the trick is to find all those places that the user can directly influence."
"00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,620","Directly or indirectly make sure that those are failsafe."
"00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,247","And any good."
"00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,140","Schafer: OK. Thank you for coming to our very first HOF."
"00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,878","We have the build, ready to go."
"00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,253","Some of you might have installed it already."
"00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,916","Oliver sent out a mail, a copied it on my mail so you can just install it on your computer."
"00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,457","And it should just magically run if you click on the ""run"" batch file."
"00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,920","It is a point-and-click graphic adventure."
"00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,120","Offscreen: What?"
"00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,660","Offscreen Voice: They don't make those anymore."
"00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,580","Offscreen Voice: Those are dead."
"00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,269","Garner: Adventure games are not dead."
"00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:15,288","Schafer: Thank you."
"00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:17,978","Schafer: It has been almost one year since we launched our Kickstarter, by the way."
"00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,464","And now we're having our first HOF."
"00:29:19,464 --> 00:29:23,906","And so we have done a lot of stuff to get this adventure game engine up and running and working"
"00:29:23,906 --> 00:29:28,495","and we have a several room area of what's called the Cloud Colony to play."
"00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,163","And we'd like to watch you play it."
"00:29:30,163 --> 00:29:34,660","Franzke: If it crashes like please come to any of the Red's programmers so we can help you, hopefully."
"00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,620","Also if it crashes during the game, which hopefully it won't, please don't."
"00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,060","If you press F1 and then go to ""load"" you can restore the previously, previous game state."
"00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,623","Schafer: OK, see you later."
"00:29:45,623 --> 00:29:47,263","We'll call you back in here in about half an hour."
"00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,739","Schafer: What, you didn't find a bug, did you?"
"00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,400","Kipnis: What? Schafer: You didn't find a bug, did you?"
"00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,980","Stapley: To soften the blow of failure."
"00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,900","Yeah!"
"00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,080","Offscreen Voice: Add something on to that, some choices, right."
"00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,100","I sent one to them."
"00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,342","I think it was like, who's Jessie or something like that, right."
"00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,349","And then he said it, and I thought it would take me back to where I could ask something else, like something else about the towers."
"00:30:24,643 --> 00:30:28,963","I guess I'm going down, the talking tree or something like that."
"00:30:28,963 --> 00:30:39,221","Raz: Man, I don't know, I don't know what, like what's the first thing to get, what to say, how do I kill this guy?"
"00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,659","Rice: All the other one's good."
"00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,540","Have you seen the one here, if you, go ahead, nothing."
"00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,029","Schafer: We aren't talking about, Rice: We're talking about you."
"00:30:51,835 --> 00:30:55,155","Just keep going. They updated the one here."
"00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,620","If you aren't coming up that ladder, it's really nice."
"00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:04,260","Ryken: Adventure games are very quiet during HOFs, a lot of thinking going on."
"00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,000","Petty: Oh, Drew crashed it."
"00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,740","Schafer: What? Who crashed?"
"00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,360","Kipnis: What was the last thing that you did, do you remember?"
"00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:18,711","Inversin: I just went down the ladder and zoomed in on her and the curser appeared and then the arrow appeared and it just froze."
"00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,180","Franzke: Yeah, I'm not sure what's happening with that crash button."
"00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,020","Chi: This is what happened when I went in here, so."
"00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,813","OK, this is where I crashed."
"00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,480","Franzke: OK, thank you."
"00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,480","Franzke: That's the other thing, that Tony plays, through Visual Studio in debug."
"00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,240","And he could reproduce a new bug. So it's Windows only, XP only."
"00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,240","Dillon: That sounds like a fun bug to fix."
"00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,460","Rice: That's the prettiest scene too."
"00:31:50,660 --> 00:32:03,640","[Music] Schafer: Hello, hello."
"00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:12,469","[Murmuring] Schafer: Hello. Thank you for playing, thank you for playing Red's."
"00:32:12,469 --> 00:32:14,724","The first people who have ever played Red's."
"00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,380","Patrick, you looked sad there for a second."
"00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,096","Did you play?"
"00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,042","Hackett: The game was extremely charming."
"00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:21,302","It's really good."
"00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,360","But..."
"00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,920","[Laughter] Schafer: But..."
"00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,586","Hackett: It's, there's just small things like I wanted to speed up some of the lines when they were repeating."
"00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,960","I wanted an explanation of what was in my inventory."
"00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,948","Franklin: The areas, someone said, I think it was a little unclear where the camera would pan and where it wouldn't."
"00:32:43,948 --> 00:32:48,502","Also as visually, maybe it wasn't clear if there was like, hey, there's more down there or there isn't."
"00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,713","That was a big one."
"00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,551","Muir: I definitely had camera issues."
"00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,672","When it stops working, you're like, oh shit."
"00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,441","Like I can't go, you know,it's like I'm walking to the edge of the screen and like it's happening and then it gets really confusing."
"00:32:59,441 --> 00:33:02,743","So I mean, I guess it's just like a little buggy in some of those areas."
"00:33:02,743 --> 00:33:05,721","But yeah, just no camera bugs, I would suggest."
"00:33:05,721 --> 00:33:08,134","Yeah, that's my suggestion."
"00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,618","Eliminate the camera bugs."
"00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,271","Remo: Obviously the background art is incredibly gorgeous."
"00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:17,475","The whole game is really beautiful, but the specific style of the art means everything"
"00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,036","just looks like part of the background and I don't get that feeling that I often get in adventure games of like,"
"00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,945","oh, these are hot spots."
"00:33:23,945 --> 00:33:25,874","I should be clicking these things."
"00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,337","And then when there were things that I thought I should be able to click on, like a big nest of eggs or something,"
"00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:36,298","instead my character would just try and path to like a plane behind it and go around, because it's not actually clickable."
"00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:41,443","So I felt like the game was discouraging me from trying to actually interact with things and find things,"
"00:33:41,443 --> 00:33:48,752","which is like to my memory, what adventure, playing adventure games, that feels like a big part of it."
"00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,620","And I felt like this game didn't want me to do that."
"00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,317","Schafer: I'm a strong believer in being, having a thick skin about feedback."
"00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:01,686","Like, 'cause when I've done writing, I've done writing in a writing group and you get together and you read your stuff and people give you feedback."
"00:34:01,686 --> 00:34:04,832","And you should be, you should say thank you when they say something bad about your script,"
"00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,989","'cause that's the thing that if you can turn it around, it now makes your script better or your writing better."
"00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:14,782","So any feedback we get, even if it's negative is like a gift, because that's just an opportunity to make the thing better."
"00:34:14,782 --> 00:34:19,799","And it's better you hear it from your team than a game reviewer or someone in the public."
"00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:26,068","Boehle: As I just was exploring the dialogue, I kind of got a better sense of like, oh, I want to kill the creature but oh,"
"00:34:26,068 --> 00:34:29,136","I guess the next time the creature's going to be there in Shellmound."
"00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:31,990","and oh, I guess I need this sap to attract the creature in Shellmound."
"00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,024","and know I need to take the tram to get there."
"00:34:34,024 --> 00:34:39,186","And so I liked how it was a very natural progression, just by talking to people without even having to solve puzzles,"
"00:34:39,186 --> 00:34:41,882","just to figure out what I wanted to do as the character."
"00:34:41,882 --> 00:34:49,079","Martz: And I agree that it has like a, kind of an open-ended quality, but I definitely would have appreciated some more like concrete goals."
"00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,000","Dawson: A little more back and forth between the characters."
"00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,896","Each kind of revealing a little bit of their world to each other."
"00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,888","That might have filled you in a little."
"00:34:56,888 --> 00:35:00,397","Muir: I think I especially noticed it when I was talking to the Harmony dude."
"00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,273","And it was just like everything that he said was just like, oh my God, that's another thing that I don't know about."
"00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,658","So like the whole world felt super-alien and just like, just super-weird."
"00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:15,443","Schafer: So you really have to get good at trying to like pry out of them what their experience is."
"00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,832","Like if they think, well, this dialogue sequence is too long, but it's really that the music that was playing is looping too much"
"00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,924","while they're doing it or the dialogue is too long."
"00:35:24,924 --> 00:35:29,828","And you know, just, you got to, you got to take all that feedback and try to turn it into a useful task to make the game better."
"00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,648","LeBreton: It sounds like partly you were just like, like when you're talking to the elder,"
"00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:36,261","you were just kind of feeling some exposition fatigue, right?"
"00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:37,404","Like, Muir: Yes."
"00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:41,121","LeBreton: he had lots to tell you and I don't know, spreading that out somehow or just..."
"00:35:41,121 --> 00:35:46,602","Muir: And it was like single world, single word questions that you're clicking on to like, for their progressed like,"
"00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,019","LeBreton: Metal Gear. Muir: Yes!"
"00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,280","It totally reminded of Metal Gear."
"00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,458","I don't want to say that."
"00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,600","Schafer: Well, we're going for a Metal Gear thing."
"00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,520","LeBreton: Obviously."
"00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,540","Schafer: Who found the cardboard box?"
"00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,640","Schafer: That was great. That was pretty good."
"00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,818","Most of it was directed toward stuff that we just know we have to do anyway, that's already on the list to get done."
"00:36:01,157 --> 00:36:04,236","Schafer: You've been through HOFs before."
"00:36:04,236 --> 00:36:07,620","Schafer: I was going to say, watching it through other people's eyes, I was really proud of how much work that you guys got done"
"00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:12,424","because it was like, the girl had an egg on her head and shoes on her feet and she was kicking up dust and she was climbing ladders."
"00:36:12,424 --> 00:36:15,124","And I was like, this game is way too complicated."
"00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,902","Who came up with all this stuff?"
"00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,520","So we'll start thinking about a thread for all of this."
"00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,985","Thanks for everyone hustling to get the build running."
"00:36:20,985 --> 00:36:21,841","It worked great."
"00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:23,093","I was very proud of it."
"00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,539","It was awesome."
"00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,205","I hope no one's feelings got hurt."
"00:36:26,205 --> 00:36:30,220","Schafer: To some like, yeah, I do need to clarify the goals and the characters that's going to be hard to do."
"00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,819","Just more work for that one, but there's nothing that came up that was really terrifying,"
"00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,520","like oh God, how are we…"
"00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,728","You know, when you're doing a game that has a lot of physical action and stuff in it,"
"00:36:38,728 --> 00:36:42,595","sometimes people are like, it's just not, the bad, the swordplay's not fun, you know."
"00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,933","And then you're just like, oh, how are we going to solve that?"
"00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,124","You know, it's just another iteration around."
"00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:52,143","But I think everything, everything that was said could easily be turned into a task that we can use to make the game better."
"00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,143","So that's good."
"00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,500","Schafer: I appreciate you guys playing it."
"00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,354","Thank you for playing."
"00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,457","Thank you for staying and chatting."
"00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,811","Thank you for clapping."
"00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,939","[Clapping] Thanks for coming."
"00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,020","Fill out your surveys."
"00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,420","Thank you."
"00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:41,862","[Music] Schafer: And some people were looking for a different experience."
"00:37:41,862 --> 00:37:48,740","Like you can tell some people were really into just progression and beating a game, which is not necessarily what a, I mean, adventure games are kind of about that,"
"00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,790","but they're also for enjoying the ride."
"00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,300","So hopefully make it as enjoyable as possible."
"00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,540","Bye. Thanks for playing."
"00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,940","Muir: Hey, it's nice. I like it."
"00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,300","It's really good."
"00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,400","Schafer: Awesome. Thanks for playing. Cool."
"00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,760","Muir: It's awesome. I'm excited."
"00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,797","Schafer: That's nice."
"00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,420","Brad."
"00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,320","He doesn't mean that."
"00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,736","He's going to say something really mean."
"00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,340","It's not as good as Iron Brigade."
"00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,300","OK. Cool."
"00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,040","Awesome."
"00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,020","Just slap my face."
"00:38:18,681 --> 00:38:22,529","[Music]"
