"00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:27,187","Offscreen Voice: Tomorrow, how's it going to play out?"
"00:00:27,187 --> 00:00:35,221","Schafer: We're going to, let's see, tomorrow, come in here, push the button, there's a big plastic button in the middle of the room."
"00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:38,567","We all push it at the same time, put our hands in and then push it."
"00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:39,726",We totally should have that.
"00:00:39,726 --> 00:00:47,019","That'd be much more dramatic than like Greg sitting at his desk and Chris and then they tap and then they're like, OK."
"00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:48,299",It's off.
"00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:52,865",But that's the way it's going to go.
"00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:22,000",[Music] Gardner: There's so much animation that needs to be polished.
"00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,469","Crook: Well, well, there's a lot that's, that's done, but it's just not in."
"00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:27,666",Somewhat slow going.
"00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:32,212",Schafer: OK. Does anyone want to say anything about the schedule?
"00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:34,232",Like how easy it looks?
"00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,565","Rice: But yeah, there's a lot to do in two months left."
"00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:40,682","Schafer: Where's the warmest spot in this, in this office?"
"00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:42,329",Crook: Just snuggle up to me.
"00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,014","Crook: This sweater and, Schafer: Oh, wow."
"00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:46,654",He's so warm in there.
"00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:48,806","Look at you, you look like a longshoreman."
"00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:50,091",Crook: I was so cold yesterday.
"00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:52,181","Schafer: You're like a lumberjack, like a lumberjack by the sea."
"00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:54,936",I just need to be by Anna's heater.
"00:01:54,936 --> 00:01:58,357","Schafer: Hey, is this thing even on?"
"00:01:58,357 --> 00:02:00,420",Kipnis: You want it on? Here.
"00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,300","Schafer: Gather 'round the fire, everybody."
"00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,359",Rice: We each should have a little fire.
"00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,276",Schafer: Hello. Is everyone here?
"00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:08,695","We'll have him, quick. OK, anyways."
"00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,473","Hey, everybody. What are you doing?"
"00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:11,655","Mr. Petty, what have you been working on?"
"00:02:11,655 --> 00:02:14,950","Petty: What we're doing up until, for the next couple weeks is getting all the new content"
"00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,149","and, which I think in art, there's very little new content."
"00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:20,571",It's mainly us repainting and polishing and refining.
"00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:22,951","Ryken: Yeah, we're coming down to the wire but it's going good."
"00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,740",I'm working on little fix-y things.
"00:02:25,743 --> 00:02:29,543","Things that were painted really crappily and are now, I'm in the time to polish up."
"00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,590",Schafer: Bagel's right here.
"00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,496","Ryken: Yes, yes."
"00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,774","I'm fixing, Petty: You better be referring to other work."
"00:02:32,774 --> 00:02:35,574","Ryken: I'm fixing the things that Bagel's ""fixing"", right now."
"00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:41,390","Ryken: We're just getting down to the point where, [Offscreen Voice]"
"00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,070",Ryken: What?
"00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,260","Ryken: Oh, look at that! That's crazy."
"00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,571",Didn't I just do that. Petty: Yeah.
"00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,719","Ryken: He's so fast, man."
"00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,131",You have the rim light working on him?
"00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,040","Man, maybe I'm just slow."
"00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:58,815","Petty: In some cases we're repeating characters, because now that we see like the range of what they did,"
"00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:01,954","like we repainted a Mog Chothra, Levi did for like the third time."
"00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:05,929",And part of that is because his presence in the game was much bigger than when we originally painted him.
"00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:10,099",And the type of stuff he needs to do for like the boss battle or for these other areas
"00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:14,510",is a greater range of movement and a lot more close-ups and has various mouth states.
"00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:21,907","So the best thing to do is like sometimes you can keep patching asset, but sometimes it's best to just go, wipe that clean."
"00:03:21,907 --> 00:03:24,254","And we know exactly how it's going to be used now, just repaint it."
"00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:25,755",So that's pretty much what we did.
"00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:28,520","And it'll pay off, because he has a lot of screen time."
"00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,098","Ryken: Yeah, we're not as pressed as the animators."
"00:03:31,098 --> 00:03:39,174","We kind of just listen to them, working their ass off over there while we kind of just pretty things up."
"00:03:39,174 --> 00:03:43,170","Gardner: Today I'm trying to get this scene in, 'cause it's such a big one."
"00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,317",It's going to be a series of like four different cut scenes that we put together in the game.
"00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:51,080","And like none of those are in the game right now, and that's like, really close to shipping."
"00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,419","So it's like this last, bit of time."
"00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:58,020","Just like every other department, we're all kinda just like rushing through everything."
"00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:07,537","Choy: The animation, like overall, like animation just has more work, but a lot of times my time is compressed into like the last,"
"00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:14,517","like couple of weeks that I can do work, because I come after everyone else and like I guess, right before audio."
"00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:18,822",Stoddard: I'm finishing all the sound in two weeks. Schafer: Yay!
"00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:28,777","Stoddard: I'm going, I'm basically following the animators as closely as possible, because I'm trying to jump on all the cut scenes as they come in and like do them."
"00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:30,497","Schafer: Ray's like, good luck, 'cause we're so fast."
"00:04:31,475 --> 00:04:36,524",Stoddard: I'm trying to save January 6 through 10 to mix the game.
"00:04:36,524 --> 00:04:42,064","I'd really, really like to have that time to do that, so I'm trying to get in as much as possible in the next two weeks."
"00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:48,683","Choy: Kind even Camden and I had a lunch where we were kind of talking about like, OK, well, we're here at this stage now"
"00:04:48,683 --> 00:04:50,486",where everything's supposed to be wrapping up.
"00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:51,822",Like what do we do?
"00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:54,372",Like what's the social fix for it?
"00:04:54,372 --> 00:04:58,506","And like part of me's like, oh, you know, like I'm just going to be really like irritable all the time"
"00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,065","and just like be really hard, kind of hard to like work with."
"00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:06,420","So like if people want to make changes they'll be like, oh my God, did I piss her off even more?"
"00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,995","So like this, like some of that, like there's like you kind of have to be a little bit of a wall,"
"00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:17,063","otherwise like, just so people, not necessarily to like stop changes, but just so people will like kind of think twice"
"00:05:17,063 --> 00:05:21,310",or like maybe think smarter when they want to polish something.
"00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,570",Schafer: So it's a little tight.
"00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,895",This means more late night food for free for Ray.
"00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:33,184","See, so it's really saving Ray money, 'cause he's going to stay late to animate all this stuff."
"00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:41,911",Rice: And this is just a bunch of rice.
"00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:44,691","Crook: You see, this is the size."
"00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,861",Schafer: I've been doing a lot of press stuff.
"00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:49,961",We went down and showed the game at the VGX Awards.
"00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:50,998",Did you guys watch?
"00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:52,195",It was fun.
"00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:53,625",I got a lot of love on Twitter from that.
"00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:58,877","And a lot of people who hadn't heard of the game before were just crazy, because I always assume the entire world knows all about the game."
"00:05:58,877 --> 00:06:00,418","But I got this like, what is this game?"
"00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:02,158","This looks kind of cool, this is awesome."
"00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:08,847","Keighley: This is really exciting, 'cause this is a guy I've loved for so long and we now have him live on the VGX stage."
"00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:10,974","Not you, Joel, but Tim Schafer is with us!"
"00:06:10,974 --> 00:06:12,243",Tim Schafer!
"00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:15,647","Tim is of course the creative genius behind Brutal Legend, Psychonauts and Grim Fandango"
"00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:21,388","and his latest is the Kickstarter funded adventure game, Broken Age, which raised over three million dollars."
"00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:22,639","McHale: Three and a half million, Geoff."
"00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,740",Schafer: Thank you.
"00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,939",Schafer: He's funny. He's nice.
"00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:26,629",He was nice to me off camera.
"00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:28,149","He was like, hey, get ready for this."
"00:06:29,243 --> 00:06:31,943",I'm going to ask you if you were high when you designed this game.
"00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:35,255","McHale: @Brandon Victoran asks, hey, Tim."
"00:06:35,255 --> 00:06:37,597",What was the inspiration for the project?
"00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,637","Schafer: Well, McHale: Did you get high or something?"
"00:06:41,646 --> 00:06:44,606","Schafer: Uh, no, no. McHale: Sorry."
"00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:48,086","Remo: It's been getting really tangible, how excited people are to play it."
"00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:51,280","Like it's been very visible and you can really, you can really feel it."
"00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,545","So it's very, very exciting, like we have a big list of stuff to do to get the game out."
"00:06:56,545 --> 00:07:01,838","You know, Greg is obviously driving that stuff so it's going to be pretty crazy few weeks,"
"00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:06,132",but I think our community is going to be incredibly enthusiastic.
"00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:08,157","Is going to, and really help us get the word out."
"00:07:08,157 --> 00:07:10,757",So it's really good times.
"00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:14,446",Rice: I think that there's going to be a lot of excitement.
"00:07:14,446 --> 00:07:19,831","Like I think we've been doing some bigger things, like VGX and stuff that's been building up, you know, hype."
"00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:25,096","And I think that ultimately the people who are going to care the most about the game are the 90,000 that already bought it"
"00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:26,746",and they're going to be super-stoked playing it.
"00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:31,075","So I feel like there's going to be a huge ripple effect from them, of them just sharing their excitement."
"00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:35,754",I think that that'll just be something that we should try and capitalize on as much as possible.
"00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,700","Bailey: the big splash, so you're thinking?"
"00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,258","Rice: Yeah, well, I just think that yeah, they've been waiting 15 years for this game."
"00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:47,098","Bailey: There is the counterpoint, just so you know, which is that, that all the adventure fans are really interested in this"
"00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:49,603",and it's a very small market and that's why most publishers got out of it.
"00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,746","Rice: Yeah, I know."
"00:07:50,746 --> 00:07:53,085",Bailey: So those fans have basically already backed the game.
"00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:54,405","Rice: Yeah. But that's what we're going to prove wrong, right?"
"00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,800","Bailey: You're going to prove that wrong, OK."
"00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,989",Rice: Everyone is a skeptic.
"00:07:56,989 --> 00:07:58,324","Bailey: But it still could, it can be somewhere between it, right?"
"00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,149","Where is the genre, is say, you know, 500,000 people."
"00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,604","Rice: Yeah, I think that that's where the quality of the game is going to be, ultimately makes a call."
"00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:12,850","Like I think if it comes out and reviews really well and people have a really great experience and are talking about it,"
"00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,846",I think the game will be able to kind of live on through really solid sales.
"00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:21,784","You know, if it has kind of average scores, then it probably will be a different story."
"00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:25,631",Schafer: Broken Age is a welcome return to the graphic adventure games by Tim Schafer.
"00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,671","See, I can't read this, it's got my name in it."
"00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:35,910",Schafer: We hired some old friends of ours who are game reviewers in the previous life
"00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:41,479","and asked them to write a review of Broken Age as if they were actually, just got a copy and were reviewing it."
"00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,783","To know, you know, is there some big thing we have overlooked or what, what might a review look like for the game."
"00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:52,183",And they came back really good.
"00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:58,046","Positives: intuitive point and click interface, good balance between exploration, character interaction and puzzle solving."
"00:08:58,046 --> 00:09:01,561",Game recognizes when players are stuck and provides clues without giving them answers.
"00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:05,361",Negatives: I missed the inventory command and the opening with Shay and the spoon.
"00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:10,409",Phfft. In the gaming industry mock reviews are a common thing.
"00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:12,843","We have never done our own, so that's the good thing."
"00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:17,267",It's like a part of what we're trying to do is being a real self-publisher.
"00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:21,473","You know, being your own publisher is taking care of these things, which are like mock reviews,"
"00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:24,753","'cause they affect how much or how you plan your launch, you know."
"00:09:25,752 --> 00:09:30,273","Like you would plan, if we got really like, if the mock reviews were like, ah, it's kind of rough,"
"00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:32,633",but they'll probably have it sorted out by the time they launch Act Two.
"00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:38,120","We might think that wouldn't, we'd be inclined to put it in the early, early access section of Steam, you know."
"00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,529","But if it came back, oh, it's super-polished and it's great."
"00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:46,448","It's like a first episode of something, and that means it really should be in the other section of the Steam, with regular games."
"00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,241",Schafer: No.
"00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:59,720","I mean, Microsoft did play tests for Psychonauts and people were like, it got like fun-ativity ratings or whatever."
"00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,470",And oh God.
"00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,006",Is that what this is?
"00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:07,366",Schafer: Here's the marketing document that Microsoft made for Psychonauts.
"00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,946","Based on the twelve focus groups conducted worldwide, the primary weakness of the game are the story line,"
"00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,526","which is considered unoriginal, childish and overly complex."
"00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:22,784","Tongue-in-cheek nature of the game is a weakness, most simply did not get the joke."
"00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:24,730",Others disliked the satirical humor.
"00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,784","In addition, many feel the humor would get old limiting replayability."
"00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:33,050",Humor should be incorporated into the game as a secondary or supporting characteristic.
"00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,930",Humor should be simplified and made immediately apparent.
"00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:41,157","[Laughter] To help international appeal, limit game components"
"00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:44,357","that feel especially Americanized, i.e. summer camp."
"00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,658","Thank you, marketing research."
"00:10:48,658 --> 00:10:51,818","Yeah. Limit, so you can obviously take this stuff too far."
"00:10:52,957 --> 00:10:54,207","I mean, good God."
"00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:57,407",Thank God we got cancelled. Anyway.
"00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,785",That's not what we're doing this time.
"00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:05,045","This time we just sent it to three reviewers that we knew and asked them to write reviews, just as if they're writing actual reviews."
"00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:06,745",As mean as you would have been.
"00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:14,286","If you've ever loved the Tim Schafer game, if you've ever loved whimsy, you will love this game."
"00:11:14,286 --> 00:11:20,384",I'm glad to see the return of the genre and the return of a legend.
"00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:22,011",See why I can't read these?
"00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:23,538",That's just embarrassing.
"00:11:23,538 --> 00:11:24,487",But it's good.
"00:11:24,487 --> 00:11:30,857","Yeah, there's no like, like it was always problematic near the end of Brutal to hear the recurring stuff about the RTS stuff,"
"00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,678","'cause that's really hard, like what are we going to do?"
"00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:35,842","What the crap, what are we going to do?"
"00:11:35,842 --> 00:11:38,284","And EA was like, we're just going to, it's good."
"00:11:38,284 --> 00:11:39,664",We're going to ship it how it is.
"00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:42,520",But here there's nothing about the quality of game.
"00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:50,673","It's more about, we have to hit the pricing right and we have to make sure the puzzles are hard enough, especially in the second act."
"00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:57,200","As pricing will directly affect the overall Metacritic score breakdown of price to Metacritic score has been included, see page 8."
"00:11:58,455 --> 00:12:00,995",For the purpose of this summary will assume a $15 to $20 price point.
"00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,580","Oh, I don't think that's what Justin's assuming."
"00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:08,330","He thinks if we charge $15, we'll get 80-85 Metacritic."
"00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,604","If we charge $20, we'll get 79 to 80 percent Metacritic."
"00:12:11,604 --> 00:12:15,344","Charge $25 to $30, we'll go to 70 to 60 percent of Metacritic."
"00:12:15,722 --> 00:12:17,022",Interesting.
"00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:25,461","Schafer: That's just him saying, I mean reviewers, I guess, take into account how much a game costs when they give it a score."
"00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:30,039","So it costs $60, you know, like geometry wars."
"00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:35,214","If that cost $60, you might give it a lower score than if it cost $15."
"00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,412",Schafer: We don't know yet.
"00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,409",That's the whole discussion.
"00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:41,306",Bailey: I know it's happening.
"00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:46,221","I just kind of disagree that that reviewer should take in, price into consideration when making this review."
"00:12:46,221 --> 00:12:48,158","Rice: Yeah, well, especially now since price fluctuates so much."
"00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:52,207",In the sense things go on sale so often and prices change and go down.
"00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:53,843","Yeah, that's a tricky one."
"00:12:53,843 --> 00:13:02,223","Bailey: And so I saw, when I, I did my research so like it showed that indie games can be anywhere from like $2.99 to about $29.99,"
"00:13:02,223 --> 00:13:04,663",as like the acceptable pricing.
"00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:06,624",There was one for $34.99...
"00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:08,064",Rice: What was that?
"00:13:08,064 --> 00:13:12,191","Bailey: Well, it was the Monkey Island one that came out, that Telltale did."
"00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,903","Rice: Of the Telltale, Tales of Monkey Island, yeah."
"00:13:13,903 --> 00:13:15,709",Bailey: But I'm going to treat that as an outlier.
"00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,466","It'll be like, OK."
"00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:23,907","The idea would be on release you would pay $24.99 and then you get both acts, Act One and Act Two."
"00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:34,173","Bailey: It is a small genre and those games used to sell, like the Grim Fandangos and you know, Full Throttles and stuff, used to sell like 500,000 copies."
"00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:36,783","You know, there were the hundreds of thousands where there were."
"00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:44,141","And you know, that's one of the reasons why if you can't sell, you know, millions upon millions now, you know, games are considered failures."
"00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:49,079","The good thing about us, is since we're publishing ourselves, you know, and it's digital distribution"
"00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,622",and we can handle almost all aspects of the publishing.
"00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,875",And so for us it actually doesn't have to make a huge amount of money.
"00:13:54,875 --> 00:14:00,394","And 500,000 copies, if it sells 500,000 copies, we'll be enormously successful as a studio."
"00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:05,199",That will supply like all the funds we need to be completely independent.
"00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,249","Rice: Anyway, this is exciting."
"00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:08,017","So, cool, man."
"00:14:08,017 --> 00:14:10,087","Rice: Yeah, it's coming."
"00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:13,307","It's actually nice, 'cause when these decisions are made and you're just like committed to them,"
"00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:16,738","then you just kind of sit back and I don't know, watch things happen."
"00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:17,598","Bailey: Yeah, can you imagine?"
"00:14:17,598 --> 00:14:23,270","What would it be like if we sold like, if we sold like blockbuster numbers for a publisher?"
"00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,650","God, it'd be crazy."
"00:14:25,423 --> 00:14:27,663",Yeah. Don't know.
"00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:38,398","Bailey: No, I, it's, you know, basically it's the studio's dream, which is to continue to operate independently."
"00:14:38,398 --> 00:14:45,286","Bailey: But like this is, the awesome time, the awesome thing about this timeframe is that there's not a lot being featured on Steam."
"00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:51,624","So we could potentially, best case scenario, like Max Paine, I think got, they got a month of a feature, basically."
"00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:57,384","If we could get that from the 28th all the way through February, that would be amazing."
"00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:05,533","Bailey: Are you OK with that, rather than, I mean, 'cause I would love five dollars more and everything,"
"00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:08,297","but I didn't want like, I just don't want the game to be, Schafer: No."
"00:15:08,297 --> 00:15:16,609","I mean, I feel like you guys have talked it through enough and I was nervous about it coming out at $30 and the mock reviews wanted it to be $20,"
"00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:19,716","so I think, Offscreen Voice: Split the difference."
"00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:22,316",Schafer: Is this a bad time to propose not splitting the game?
"00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:27,413",Considered that lately? Wouldn't have to think about any of this stuff for a while.
"00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:31,289","No, I'm excited about shipping."
"00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:32,502",I'm excited about it.
"00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:40,013","Bailey: I think this is actually going to probably be, I think it will result in a better showing than if you had kept it all together."
"00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:41,978",Schafer: I think it definitely got more people talking about the game.
"00:15:41,978 --> 00:15:43,538",Bailey: Yes.
"00:15:43,538 --> 00:15:47,632","But it's like, the more opportunities you actually have to sell, actually potentially better."
"00:15:47,632 --> 00:15:49,132",Schafer: Sell each puzzle.
"00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,700",I don't like this puzzle; I'd like to return this puzzle.
"00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:56,838",Bailey: Micro transactions to adventure games. Schafer: OK.
"00:15:56,838 --> 00:16:02,916","Bailey: You know you have the fun start, about the build lockdown and timelines for all the stuff that needs to get done."
"00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:07,208","So when is the build, like when are we done touching it?"
"00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:08,636",Rice: Yeah. I don't know.
"00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:13,006","That's a question that I would like to involve other people in, like Oliver."
"00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:16,355","Offscreen Voice: So you know, what is happening at this point?"
"00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:18,507","Franzke: A lot, a lot is happening."
"00:16:18,507 --> 00:16:28,585","Yeah, we kind of just switched into, I guess what's often called finaling mode where it's a lot of, I'm basically going away from working on tasks"
"00:16:28,585 --> 00:16:31,724",and more towards fixing issues in the game.
"00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,444",Just so that we can maybe get a stable version that can be released eventually.
"00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,251",Romero: That's a crash.
"00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:47,494","Yeah, you can press ""space"" to skip the cut scenes."
"00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:51,682","So in this particular case, for some, you just skip the cut scene and crash."
"00:16:51,682 --> 00:16:56,921","Yeah, we've skipped that cut scene, I want to say thousands of times, you know, collectively."
"00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:59,701",And now it decides to crash for some reason.
"00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,422",That's really how most bugs are found.
"00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:04,888","You're not trying to do something, it happens."
"00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:09,810","What I've learned is that the nature of the adventure game is that it's, everything is very handcrafted, right?"
"00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,946",You want to control every step of the way because it's all story driven.
"00:17:12,946 --> 00:17:19,520","And because of that, you have so many little points where it just, there's a bad graphic or the audio's off"
"00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,246",or characters look weird doing a particular action.
"00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:28,935","And because they want a very specific type of sort of experience, like to look a certain way and sound a certain way,"
"00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:32,951",you just end up with a lot of little bugs in between all the big functional stuff.
"00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:36,380","So functionally, I mean, it's not too complex, you know, point and click."
"00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,689",I'd say our save load system is probably the most complicated because save load's always complicated anyway.
"00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:43,496",And at this point it's just polish.
"00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:47,238","Little graphics things, animation, there's a lot of missing audio, stuff like that."
"00:17:47,238 --> 00:17:49,302",So this is the Broken Age database.
"00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:51,960",This is the list of all bugs.
"00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,205","This particular issue is going to be for Oliver, which means it's a system bug."
"00:17:57,205 --> 00:17:58,516",And that's it.
"00:17:58,516 --> 00:18:03,694","Once you have all the detail, the title, the steps, any attachments, if you need them."
"00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:04,908",In this case we don't.
"00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:07,579",Submit the bug and off it goes.
"00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:15,299","Franzke: The QA team is very, very good at like describing exactly how they got to this and they even say sometimes oh, this doesn't happen all the time."
"00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:23,168","So there's a problem in this particular scene where the characters occasionally will kind of, you see the jitter?"
"00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:26,112","See, see how this kind of like jitters? So OK."
"00:18:26,112 --> 00:18:30,719","So at first, the first thing I do, I will actually look at the scene and you know, try to see the problem like this."
"00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:33,224","Like oh yeah, obviously that's something going on."
"00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:40,022","Then we have certain tools in the game that we can use to kind of just trying to figure out what's, what's happening."
"00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:44,352",I can actually pause the game in the auto-debugger that we wrote for the game.
"00:18:44,352 --> 00:18:50,827","And I'm going to, you know, basically step through frame by frame in this particular case."
"00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:54,877","And then I very often will just look at, OK, so first of all, do those numbers line up?"
"00:18:54,877 --> 00:19:00,165","Because like, you know, the camera, animation has to be at the exact same frame, then the characters."
"00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:06,191","And I already see like, you know, this set of frames, 732 and this is like at the frame 734."
"00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:08,987","So like weird, why is this happening."
"00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:18,614","And then I basically will have to go into visual studio where they'll, you know, the code is for the game, like animation control."
"00:19:18,614 --> 00:19:22,923",A lot of what I do is actually just understanding what is going on.
"00:19:22,923 --> 00:19:25,082",Like that takes 95 percent of the time.
"00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:30,973","Once you know what's going on, very often the fix is pretty easy, but you know, since there's so much code and so much things,"
"00:19:30,973 --> 00:19:36,479","so many things going on at the same time, the understanding what is actually happening is usually the way, way, way more"
"00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:41,018",difficult part of actually implementing a fix for it.
"00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:46,596","But yeah, I mean, that's like in a nutshell what's going on."
"00:19:46,596 --> 00:19:49,753","Romero: And then on our end, I just try to get to the tasks."
"00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:56,595","Like we have a lot of bug regressions right now, just 'cause they're fixing quicker than we can check them to make, to verify that they're fixed."
"00:19:56,595 --> 00:20:00,531",So we always have just a backlog of bugs we need to get through on that end.
"00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:01,507",And new bugs.
"00:20:01,507 --> 00:20:02,644","Like I said, don't stop."
"00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:05,657",So at this point you can't afford to ignore any bug.
"00:20:05,657 --> 00:20:07,306","So you see it, you report it."
"00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:13,343","Yeah, every time you hear a little groan or something coming from that end, that's probably every new bug."
"00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:16,329",Franzke: I think animation is winning the bug count right now.
"00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:18,051",And it probably will be until the end.
"00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:22,504","So a lot of it is just, you know, animation polish and stuff like that."
"00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:26,967","I think they probably have like twice as many bugs, any of the other like departments."
"00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:30,264","Roberts: Yeah, and this is all animation bugs."
"00:20:30,264 --> 00:20:33,372",So it's something like 130.
"00:20:33,372 --> 00:20:36,303",Essentially right now the red ones are unfinished cut scenes.
"00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:41,166",And so that's what we're striving to do by tomorrow.
"00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,677",They're set by priority.
"00:20:42,677 --> 00:20:48,197","And it doesn't, it doesn't show it here, but there's Pri-1, Pri-2, right down to 4, I think."
"00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:51,889","Four would be like, it'd be nice to have, but not essential."
"00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:55,622","And 3 is like we should fix it, otherwise it'll look crappy."
"00:20:55,622 --> 00:21:01,204",And 2 being it is going to look really bad and unfinished if we don't do this.
"00:21:01,204 --> 00:21:04,615","And 1 being a breaker, like it actually just breaks the game."
"00:21:04,615 --> 00:21:08,341","Gardner: When you get into bug fixing phase, a lot of time animators will be like oh, I want to,"
"00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:13,856","like this is the animation that we should be polishing, but instead I'm polishing this animation because this is reported as a bug."
"00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,393","It's stuff that I'm like, that should be fixed and that should be fixed."
"00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:17,660",Nobody cares.
"00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,953","Like, I'm like, like it's like high fantasy."
"00:21:19,953 --> 00:21:23,104","Like I'm really into it, but like not everybody else is."
"00:21:23,104 --> 00:21:30,650","Roberts: What I'm really trying to do is not get freaked out about, about things right now,"
"00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,338",because the holidays are coming up and I just want to relax and rebuild my energy.
"00:21:35,338 --> 00:21:37,050",And then come back strong.
"00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:42,720","We could be panicking right now and we probably should be panicking, but I'm not going to do that."
"00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,088",I'm Zen right now.
"00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:48,781","I'm just going to, I'm just going to turn off and then when I come back on the second,"
"00:21:48,781 --> 00:21:51,089","that's, it'll be time to freak out for me."
"00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:58,806","Franzke: Again, I think the problem is to some degree, it feels like the release day is far away, but it's really not."
"00:21:58,806 --> 00:22:00,819","Because it's like, oh, it's next year, right?"
"00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,684","That's, you know, once you say that, we're going to release the game next year, that feels like, oh,"
"00:22:03,684 --> 00:22:05,834",that's so far away we don't really need to worry about it too much.
"00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:11,487",But I think in terms of working weeks that we have until the game ships is like two or two and a half.
"00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:16,995","So it's really not that much time, given the amount of issues that are being reported."
"00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:19,640",It's somewhat scary for sure.
"00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:27,210","So yeah, it's like a lot of people do tend to work, you know, late hours now, starting now but then, you know, also people"
"00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,118",leave for Christmas break and stuff like that.
"00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:33,567",And so it's kind of a weird kind of thing going on.
"00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:35,248",Franzke: Say something or are we just standing here?
"00:22:35,248 --> 00:22:36,361","Schafer: Yeah, we're all going to stand."
"00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:37,940",Kipnis: What are we saying?
"00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:41,309","Schafer: Happy holidays, I think we say."
"00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:42,686",That's what the Christmas card says.
"00:22:42,686 --> 00:22:43,981","Well, I am going to say something."
"00:22:43,981 --> 00:22:45,420","Rice: And then we'll all say ""happy holidays""."
"00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,406",Schafer: This is all going in and out.
"00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:49,968","Hello, adventure gamers from everyone on the Broken Age team."
"00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,859",We just wanted to say happy holidays.
"00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:55,141",Happy holidays? Happy holidays.
"00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:56,228",Hey. Get back to work.
"00:22:56,228 --> 00:22:57,908","Finish it, finish it."
"00:23:03,553 --> 00:23:08,046","Ryken: We had one little portion of the tree showing, so we had two little ornaments that we put on it."
"00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:10,445","Their mind will fill in the rest, right?"
"00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:12,645","It'll be like, hey, great job."
"00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:33,720","[Music] Schafer: OK, hello, hello, everybody!"
"00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:34,735",It's so nice to see you all.
"00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:35,840",Everyone here?
"00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,142",Everybody ready to go?
"00:23:37,142 --> 00:23:38,481","Hello, Happy New Year to you all."
"00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:40,048","This is the first meeting since the new year began, right?"
"00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:41,291","Yeah, yeah, welcome back."
"00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:49,894",I'm so glad some of you survived the holidays and driving and you all decided to come work here for another year.
"00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:54,415","Speaking of that, Bagel's actually been here 13 years."
"00:23:54,415 --> 00:23:58,719","[Applause] Schafer: No, no."
"00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:00,159","No clapping, he's not here."
"00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,770","Sorry, Bagel, you're not here."
"00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,971","Yeah, you can clap."
"00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:04,155",He's actually coming up to visit.
"00:24:04,155 --> 00:24:06,188",Does anyone know when he's coming out to visit?
"00:24:06,188 --> 00:24:10,363","He's coming here on, Offscreen Voice: On his fourteenth year."
"00:24:10,363 --> 00:24:12,043",Schafer: And he'll be here for two weeks?
"00:24:12,043 --> 00:24:13,243",Offscreen Voice: Until the 31st.
"00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,275","Schafer: OK, awesome."
"00:24:15,415 --> 00:24:16,755",So then you can clap for him then.
"00:24:18,342 --> 00:24:22,066","Let's talk about Red's for a second, just 'cause it's launching next Tuesday."
"00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:23,686",To backers.
"00:24:23,686 --> 00:24:25,774",We are shipping this thing to backers.
"00:24:25,774 --> 00:24:31,144",And then on the 28th it's going to go out to the regular rest of the world.
"00:24:31,144 --> 00:24:32,206","But yeah, this is exciting."
"00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:34,800","We have, we're all working on the Bugzilla right now."
"00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,364","Everyone knows what they're doing pretty much, so why are having these days?"
"00:24:37,364 --> 00:24:38,462",I guess just to cheer everyone up.
"00:24:38,462 --> 00:24:39,750","Hey, you guys!"
"00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,101",We're going to ship a game.
"00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:42,454",Rice: Now I think let's talk about lockdown and stuff like that.
"00:24:42,454 --> 00:24:44,824","Schafer: And that. So lock it down, people."
"00:24:44,824 --> 00:24:46,264","Rice: Oliver, you want to talk about lockdown?"
"00:24:46,264 --> 00:24:48,024","Franzke: Sure. Lockdown, let's do it."
"00:24:48,024 --> 00:24:50,685",It's good. Right.
"00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:55,813","I mean everybody's still working and I, I mean I see like lots of things still happening this week."
"00:24:55,813 --> 00:24:59,792","However, I'm, I am going to get the release kind of branch ready."
"00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:07,657","Basically I'm going to manually integrate changes into the, like nothing goes into the branch without, you know, me looking at it,"
"00:25:07,657 --> 00:25:10,525","make sure that it's like, there are no risky changes going in."
"00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:13,840","And like the amount of risk is going to be reduced over time, for sure."
"00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,264",Just to make sure that the build is as stable as possible.
"00:25:17,264 --> 00:25:20,407",So just like how we do in the past for build days.
"00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:27,590","Like we basically going to just try to play through the game and individual changes that need to go in for the 14th, they will be manually integrated."
"00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,687",Schafer: Talk to Oliver directly.
"00:25:28,687 --> 00:25:29,967",And you'll make an angry face.
"00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:31,094",Franzke: I will make angry face.
"00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:33,118","Schafer: Show me the face you have to see if you want to add, yeah."
"00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:36,716",You'll have to look at that face if you want to add anything to the game after Thursday.
"00:25:36,716 --> 00:25:42,951","Franzke: Right now Linux is driving me insane, but I'm sure, she'll do all good."
"00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:47,040",But other than that it looks pretty stable recently and I would like to keep it that way for sure.
"00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,038","Schafer: OK, great."
"00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:49,838",Any other questions?
"00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:50,518",All right.
"00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,954",Go check Bugzilla.
"00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,100",See you guys later.
"00:25:54,514 --> 00:26:33,213",[Music] Crook: We're doing pretty good.
"00:26:33,213 --> 00:26:38,174",We're at final stretch for the backer build.
"00:26:38,174 --> 00:26:39,831",So this will be a Beta build.
"00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:44,334","So it needs to be, not completely bug-free, but mostly."
"00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:46,689",Last night I got home about 1:00.
"00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:52,189","I get home about 1:00 and then I couldn't sleep for about two, I just at in bed for two hours, just like thinking about today"
"00:26:52,189 --> 00:26:56,225","and what we had to get done and it's just like, just stupid."
"00:26:56,225 --> 00:27:01,515","I got to, you know; see my kids and my wife."
"00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:05,580","So yeah, I have an aunt that's visiting right now, I haven't seen her yet."
"00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,410","She's been here for like four days and I haven't, I literally haven't seen her yet."
"00:27:11,982 --> 00:27:18,960","Crook: Yeah. Camden's getting hit probably the worst because cut scenes come in, you know, really late in the game."
"00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,200","Yeah, I think Camden has stayed here a couple nights."
"00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:27,723",Stoddard: I'm having to revisit a lot of things.
"00:27:27,723 --> 00:27:34,239","Things get redesigned or they get polished and timing has to move around, which is cool."
"00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:37,208",But there's a lot.
"00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,347",[Explosion sound] OK. That's fine.
"00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:50,500","This is a hard, hard crunch but it's more about getting it right."
"00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:57,292","And I've been on other crunches where it wasn't about that, it was about we got it wrong and now we have to fix it."
"00:27:57,292 --> 00:28:06,610","I'm just here because I know if Double Fine makes it and really, really makes this happen, it's going to be amazing."
"00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,729",It's going to be an amazing company.
"00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:14,184","I mean, it's already good, but we're just like struggling for years."
"00:28:14,184 --> 00:28:22,363","And I think a lot of people here kind of hang on because like they know, they know Tim, they know, they know the management,"
"00:28:22,363 --> 00:28:26,426","they know the vision and if it hits, it'll be really good."
"00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:27,598",It'll be really good.
"00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:30,058",So we're just hanging in.
"00:28:31,284 --> 00:28:36,524","Schafer: We are launching Red's tomorrow, crazy time."
"00:28:36,524 --> 00:28:38,450",All of our backers.
"00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,175",[Applause].
"00:28:41,175 --> 00:28:43,650",Thank you to our team for working so hard.
"00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:51,698","We are going to the backers tomorrow and the rest of the general population, future backers, if you will, on the 28th."
"00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:57,223","Rice: Ah, we're about to launch a game."
"00:28:59,243 --> 00:29:01,850",In eight minutes.
"00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:08,242","I feel like, I feel like I'm kind of even in the same boat as backers, which is that's this, a really surreal thing that's happening."
"00:29:08,242 --> 00:29:10,578",I don't know.
"00:29:10,578 --> 00:29:18,492","It's been a long time in the making, you know, it's two years almost now since we launched the Kickstarter and yeah."
"00:29:18,492 --> 00:29:26,462","Sometimes it just felt like it was never going to get here and now it's here and you know, this is something that really shouldn't exist."
"00:29:26,462 --> 00:29:33,289",Like it's crazy that this exists and was able to be made this way and that the game that we've made is something that's coming out.
"00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:40,735","You know, I grew up playing Tim's old adventure games, young, like in elementary school."
"00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:49,853",And I feel like they were kind of the games that showed me that games could be like an art or could be something different or something bigger.
"00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:55,687","And you know, the fact that I'm here now, like working on this game and putting this out"
"00:29:55,687 --> 00:29:59,643",is really a dream and the weirdest thing that's ever happened.
"00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:00,985",And the best thing that's ever happened to me.
"00:30:00,985 --> 00:30:04,013",So it's exciting.
"00:30:04,013 --> 00:30:05,741",Schafer: All right. I've got to call my mom and say happy birthday.
"00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:08,202",Rice: What?
"00:30:08,202 --> 00:30:10,060",Schafer: I got to call my mom and say happy birthday.
"00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,191","Rice: Oh, yeah. Do that."
"00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:14,171",Schafer: We're releasing our game today.
"00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:23,217","Yeah, well, it's, it should go out at 10:00, which is now so it's going to be out there."
"00:30:23,217 --> 00:30:24,857",And Dad can help you download it.
"00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,040","OK, happy birthday, mom."
"00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,700",Rice: The game is up.
"00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:33,445",Preorders are up.
"00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:35,280",Schafer: Whoohoo! Rice: Yeah.
"00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,373","Schafer: All right, next game."
"00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:39,126","Rice: Yeah, we're going to take everybody out."
"00:30:39,126 --> 00:30:43,525","So there's going to be a team lunch today, probably drinks later, too."
"00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:46,880","I'm going out for drinks, so I hope people will join me."
"00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,811","But yeah, we're going to take everybody out for lunch and thank them for all the hard work"
"00:30:51,811 --> 00:30:56,359",and just take a nice breather before diving back into Two Act.
"00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:59,079","Schafer: So thanks, everybody."
"00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:15,060",[Clinking glasses] [Music]
"00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,140",Schafer: Hey it's Nathan Bagel Stapely!
"00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:35,740",[Applause] [Music]
"00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:37,810","Schafer: This is downloading, start playing now."
"00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,630","Let's hope you did a good job, Tim."
"00:31:42,661 --> 00:31:46,168","Me and my two girls sitting on my lap, can't wait."
"00:31:46,168 --> 00:31:48,608",Sounds like I'd buy that for a dollar.
"00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,206","Played 30 minutes, very happy so far."
"00:31:52,206 --> 00:31:56,254",Thanks to you and the Double Fine team. Rice: Yay!
"00:31:56,254 --> 00:31:59,375",Schafer: It's like send any little bit of feedback.
"00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,339","OK, I need some more proof that people are playing it."
"00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:04,165","Rice: Tim, there's Twitch streams."
"00:32:04,165 --> 00:32:06,399","Schafer: Well, I don't want to watch that."
"00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,939","Well, maybe I do."
"00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,598","Oh, man. This is weird."
"00:32:17,598 --> 00:32:20,043","He's going to pick avalanche, no, foreign body."
"00:32:20,043 --> 00:32:21,923","Foreign body, hull. Train."
"00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:25,540","Foreign body, oh! Avalanche!"
"00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,934","That's good. Very good, avalanche."
"00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:29,634",Now I'm totally into watching that.
"00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,371",Schafer: What if he just said something really crappy right now.
"00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,471",Computer Voice: All right.
"00:32:44,471 --> 00:32:46,855","Looks like that'll be it, guys."
"00:32:46,855 --> 00:32:54,784","Thanks a lot for watching and if anyone who is watching is involved in making this in any shape or form, then congratulations."
"00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,554",I think this is a winner.
"00:32:57,554 --> 00:33:43,326",[Music] Game Character: I'm going to sit here forever.
"00:33:43,634 --> 00:33:44,774",Offscreen Voice: But I don't know I need those yet.
"00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,280",Schafer: Because you fell through the clouds.
"00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,370","Offscreen Voice: I don't know why my character knows that she needs them, 'cause she hasn't heard any..."
"00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,628",Schafer: She's just interested in shoes.
"00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:52,873","Offscreen Voice: No, that's not true."
"00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,040",Schafer: And she fell through the clouds.
"00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,302",Offscreen Voice: The other guys in there said that I needed shoes.
"00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:56,402",Schafer: Yeah.
"00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,680","Offscreen Voice: I don't know if I clicked on that dialogue option, though."
"00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,520",Game Character: What are you doing down here?
"00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,700",Vella: I'm an offering for the Maidens Feast.
"00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,677",Schafer: She fell through the clouds.
"00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,560",Obviously she knows she needs cloud shoes.
"00:34:11,252 --> 00:34:12,806",You're playing it wrong.
"00:34:12,806 --> 00:34:14,706",Game Character: Kind of shabby looking for a Maidens Feast.
