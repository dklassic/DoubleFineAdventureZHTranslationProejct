"00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,336","Schafer: Oh, Brad is out. Okay."
"00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,371",Hello everybody.
"00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,405",Hi. It's good to see you.
"00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,706",Hello. Thank you for coming.
"00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:44,444","So, uh, it's Monday, and Friday was terrible."
"00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:45,812","Uh, all of you were here."
"00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:49,616","I want to just think everyone for, uh, showing so much class"
"00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:50,817",going through that difficult day.
"00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:54,454","You guys all, um, uh, held together nicely."
"00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:58,525","It was a rough day on everybody and, um, I think you showed a lot of compassion"
"00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:03,196","for the people who are leaving and also understanding for those of us who had to make that decision,"
"00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,265",and it really helped us get through it.
"00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:09,002","And we will--we are getting through it, and it's, um..."
"00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,539",Now we have a bunch of games we gotta make and stuff to do.
"00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:17,844","Um, we are still helping the people who need letters of reference,"
"00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,846","letters of recommendation, stuff like that."
"00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:23,450",Help--doing what we can to get them set up with new engagements.
"00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:28,522","Um, but other than that, we here are still working on these games."
"00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,694",Did you want to talk about the layoffs?
"00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,529",-Is that part of the documentary?
"00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,298",Talk about the layoffs. I'm gonna have a drink.
"00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,100",Can I drink on camera?
"00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,536","If the kids are watchin' this, kids, don't drink."
"00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:46,540","A week ago, we had a project canceled, an unannounced project from a publisher"
"00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,874",that really liked the game.
"00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:51,278",We had just done our vertical slice and then gave us great feedback on it
"00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,046",and they said it was great and they really liked it.
"00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:58,352",And then the next call was they're canceling it for higher-up reasons.
"00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,988","Well, that was a big project that was funding a lot of people."
"00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:06,326",And--and then another one of our publishers from another project is having financial problems
"00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,161",and can't pay us.
"00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,498","Bailey: You know, it's public news now that Majesco is, um..."
"00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,734",Pardon me.
"00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,735",Not timed there.
"00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:18,805",Majesco has made a public statement that
"00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:24,444","their, you know, continued ability to perform as--as a going concern is at stake and, of course,"
"00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:28,715",we did Costume Quest 2 with them and the payments were not complete for that.
"00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:32,719",So we're actually-- we're owed money by Majesco that we're not getting paid.
"00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,990","And then, of course Costume Quest 2, um, because of that statement, you can infer"
"00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,795",that it's not being marketed properly and it's not being distributed to its fullest extent
"00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:46,767","that you would expect from a publisher, because there-- you know, the means and the people there to do that"
"00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,368",just don't exist anymore.
"00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,736","Um, so it's kind of a perfect storm."
"00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:53,206",It was a bad week to put it mildly.
"00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,308","So, glad that week's over."
"00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,645","If that publisher hadn't canceled it, you know, things would have been--"
"00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,714",were looking really good for the studio.
"00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,817","Um, I think things are still looking really good for the studio,"
"00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,720",but only because we took quick action.
"00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,256",Schafer: So we had to let go of 12 people.
"00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:15,629","Some of them, uh, had been here for a short period of time and some of them had been here for a long period of time,"
"00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:16,863",over ten years.
"00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,133",So that was really hard.
"00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,703","Stoddard: What do you want to know, how I feel about them and-- Off camera: Yeah, yeah, how was it? I mean you--"
"00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,238",Stoddard: It was horrible. -Yeah.
"00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,241",It was really horrible. Um...
"00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:34,514","I mean, I understand why it happened, but, like, we--the audio team was super tight, uh,"
"00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,416",and now there's two of us instead of four.
"00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,318","Um, it was a heavy hit."
"00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,855",The day of the layoffs were just brutal.
"00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:47,494","Kipnis: Uh, well, I will say that the layoffs-- I wasn't actually at the office when it happened, so..."
"00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:52,632","And, um, at first, like, I--I got-- I got text messages about it"
"00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:56,103","and it was, uh..."
"00:03:56,103 --> 00:04:02,342","it was really tough to--to hear about it, um, and it--it was tough to, like, not be here to say goodbye"
"00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,779",to some of those people that I've worked with for years and years
"00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:10,884","and, like, you know, I'm gonna miss a lot."
"00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:13,854",I don't know what else to say.
"00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:20,192","Crook: And you always feel a little bit guilty when you're still here, you know, and other people aren't,"
"00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:28,235","um, and it hurts morale quite a bit, um, but..."
"00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,304",but I know that it--I know that it was not taken lightly.
"00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,007",Hansen: It was the hardest day of my life.
"00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:40,580","I never thought we would be in that situation, but project cancelations happen and, you know,"
"00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,749",sometimes you can absorb it and sometimes you can't.
"00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:49,489",So Tim and I almost avoided each other just 'cause we knew that we had to meet and talk about that.
"00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,259","And I didn't want to, and he didn't want to either."
"00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,495","There was no, like, oh, yeah, it's so easy, it's person X, Y, and Z."
"00:04:55,495 --> 00:05:01,001",It's like every single one of those people are-- they're huge contributors to all these games we've made.
"00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:06,206","They're the people we hang out with after work and so-- And, you know, and it's tough for Double Fine in general,"
"00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:10,343","because historically, I mean, we even said this in the media in the past,"
"00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,345",we don't do layoffs and that sort of thing.
"00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:16,016",It was--it was a tough decision for sure.
"00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:20,053","Russell: A lot of us just stayed afterwards in the room, after we were told, and just talked about"
"00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:23,823","the history of the company, and just, we were like, we couldn't believe this happened to us,"
"00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,794","but you know, in the game industry and in any entertainment industry,"
"00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,030",it's--it's the norm.
"00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:36,536","We're the exception, so in that respect I-- I--I feel lucky,"
"00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:41,775","and we'll survive, a little bit smaller, a little leaner, but we'll make it."
"00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:56,990","[Music] Schafer: So basically we are powering forward on our, um,"
"00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,826","uh, remaining titles that we're working on."
"00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,095",Those are the stories I really wanted to make the documentary about
"00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,831","but we could never do that, like, those publisher games,"
"00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,235","to see, like, what it's like, all those meetings where they're saying,"
"00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:12,806","""This game is so great, we can't wait to see it."" And then the meeting where they actually said it's canceled,"
"00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:16,676","we have to cancel it, but I hope you still make it 'cause I really want to play it."
"00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,512","That was an actual quote from the guy, he was like, ""If you make it"
"00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,082","I really want to play it."" It's like, ""Oh, thanks, that makes up"
"00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,718",for me laying off 12 people.
"00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,554",That--I totally feel good now that you want to play this game
"00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:35,528","that you just killed."" But, um, since I'm mostly fueled by angriness and bitterness,"
"00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:39,699",then I'm stronger than ever right now.
"00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,704","You know, whatever works."
"00:06:44,960 --> 00:07:12,560",[Music] [Chatter]
"00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,768","Schafer: Oh god, is that thing still here? Mitchell: It's way funnier now."
"00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,869",Muir: It was just sad. Mitchell: Yeah.
"00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,304",Muir: It wasn't bad. Mitchell: No.
"00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,205",Schafer: That one that you found under the sink?
"00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,774","Muir: It's really good. It's like, uh..."
"00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,808","Mitchell: It's gooey, though."
"00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,310",Muir: Chipotle.
"00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,644",Schafer: Is everyone here?
"00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:28,315","[Murmuring] Hello, everybody! Hello."
"00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,984",And thank you for coming back to work here again for another year.
"00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,819",It's awesome to see you all here.
"00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:33,753",Welcome back.
"00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,755",Nice to see you all.
"00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:36,856","Rice: Yeah, man."
"00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,191",2015.
"00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,026",Schafer: 2015. Wait a second.
"00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,562",Does that mean we didn't finish in December?
"00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,797",Rice: Yeah.
"00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,732",Comin' on three years.
"00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:48,001",Schafer: Three--no kidding? It's like Rip Van Winkle.
"00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:53,073","All I remember is the Kickstarter, and then I woke up and it's three years later."
"00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,808","Crook: And we all have big, long--and we all have big, long beards."
"00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,643","Schafer: Yeah, we're just here with beards."
"00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,145","Ray, where did all that money go, what?"
"00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,081",I guess we should ship this game.
"00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,316",But the game was awesome.
"00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:09,389","Um, but, um, but we-- I think I'm trying to this week still keep play testing,"
"00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:13,493",especially the problem areas in the game where people get hung up the most
"00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,362",and catch any remaining dialogue.
"00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:19,532",There's probably some object interactions or examine lines that are still missing that I would love to catch.
"00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:23,837","Please keep talking and don't be freaked out that we're not answering you, 'cause we'd just like"
"00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,105",to hear what you're thinking.
"00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,840",Miller: All right.
"00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,675",I'm already baffled.
"00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,877",Vella: Is this one?
"00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,645",Miller: This must be incredibly fun to watch.
"00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:35,481",Schafer: We're not even here.
"00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:36,850",Miller: What's that? You're not paying attention?
"00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,284","Schafer: Yeah, I'm doing my taxes over here."
"00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:43,857",Miller: I think I'll switch to Shay 'cause I can't figure this out.
"00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,794","Schafer: I mean, it's--it--that-- the first puzzle, it's, like, one of the first puzzles that Vella has,"
"00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:53,333","and you have to do something and get this visual feedback, and you have to mess with it a lot and get some more feedback"
"00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,835",to kind of figure out the patterns.
"00:08:55,835 --> 00:09:00,540","Um, and then it's just a problem of, like, have we kind of inceptioned? Is that a verb?"
"00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,710",Put the idea in the player's head of what they want to do enough.
"00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,312",'Cause sometimes you just mess with the game and you just kind of bang on it
"00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,149","and you--woo, you solved it, you don't really know how you solved it."
"00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,984",And that to me is almost a worst-case scenario.
"00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,319","That's almost worse than getting stuck forever, you know?"
"00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,322","Like, getting-- 'cause being stuck forever, if you finally solve it you feel great."
"00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,325","But if you solve it in accident, you're like, I don't know what just happened, you move on"
"00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,828",and you kind of get this kind of bored feeling.
"00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:25,031",And it's really easy to just accidently put this one line in
"00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,001",that makes everybody just know what to do immediately.
"00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:33,273","So it's--it's like a lot of-- 'cause time--time is short and we don't have much-- we don't have much time left,"
"00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:36,443","and to solve these problems, to make sure that everyone gets through the game,"
"00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:39,712","it's really tempting to just kind of, like, short circuit all the puzzles and make sure"
"00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,714",that everybody can get through them.
"00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:46,719","But you have to kind of take a lot of time to actually really look, um, carefully at, like,"
"00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,255",each mental leap the player is making.
"00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:54,027","[Off camera] If people were saying the first one was too easy and you're taking out a lot of the hints,"
"00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,995","I mean, are you afraid you went too far in the other direction?"
"00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,731","-It seems like there's a lot-- Schafer: Well, I'm hoping-- I'm hoping we went way too far."
"00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,434","Rice: But yeah, like Tim said, in general I think we're gonna keep play testing"
"00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,004",in hopes that anything that we find that is a problem
"00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,873",down the road could be changed.
"00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:13,012","Crook: Are we gonna have-- with--with Ben leaving, are we having any other-- another GP coming on"
"00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,248",or are we gonna be able to just absorb?
"00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:19,285","Peck: Um, well, it's my second to last day here at Double Fine."
"00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:25,458","And, uh, just trying to, like, put a bow on as many things as I could before leaving."
"00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:31,264",The place I'm going to is quite a bit-- it's like a larger company so...
"00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,466","I'm--yeah, I'm gonna miss the..."
"00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:39,706","like, the small little scenes at the lunch table or, like, company meetings and stuff like that"
"00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:46,746","where, like, it's okay to make a dick joke or, like, it's okay to..."
"00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,015",to just kind of be yourself a bit.
"00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,584",Um...
"00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:58,324","I'm hoping I can kind of take a little bit of that for-- like, with me wherever I go, you know?"
"00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:02,996","I feel bad I'm not gonna be there for, like, when the shit inevitably hits the fan, you know,"
"00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,098",and the game needs to be finaled.
"00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,199",Kipnis: That jerk.
"00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,802","No, I mean, it sucks."
"00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:15,675","It sucks. I mean, Ben--Ben contributed a lot to the--to the game and, you know, we're--"
"00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:21,781",we're having to kind of figure out some stuff in the code that he wrote when he could have been here to help us out.
"00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:27,754","I mean, it sucks, but, um, we'll just have to finish without him, you know?"
"00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:35,595","Crook: I mean, I will say, you know, we've had to transition because, um, Lee left the project"
"00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:40,400","and, um, that was-- that was scary, um, because he--he seemed to know"
"00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,035",what was going on with everything.
"00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:47,440","And so I think Anna's had to take on a lot of some of the responsibilities that Lee had, um,"
"00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,244",as far as puzzle chains and--and how those are all put together
"00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,379",and--and the logic.
"00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,316","Um, so I'm sure that's been stressful for her."
"00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,852",[Offscreen] Do you regret not getting to see Broken Age through to the end?
"00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,087","Petty: Yeah, you know, I'm trying to think."
"00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,224",I think this is the only time I haven't stayed on a project
"00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,558",all the way through.
"00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,128","It was a lot of those, um, small decisions right at the end of the project"
"00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,698",that have a big impact on the game 'cause all the content's there
"00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:12,832",and it's all connected.
"00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,401",And sometimes just pushing and pulling a few things
"00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,671","can--it, um, can really help the game, and it's nice to be part of that."
"00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:23,843","But, uh, I don't think I'll be part of that for Act 2 anyways, but--"
"00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:30,350","I think I'm--I'm excited for Act 2 to come out, because I think Act 1 had a lot of great things about it"
"00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,721","but it was incomplete, and, you know, you can sort of see the whole arc or play the whole game,"
"00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:38,825",might get a better sense of whether that was successful or not.
"00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:45,531","But hopefully I've helped set that up, um, to be a--to be a great experience."
"00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,866",Schafer: But we don't need anybody.
"00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,868",Broken Age team.
"00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,703",We don't-- we don't need nobody.
"00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,272",We'll finish it ourselves.
"00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,841","So where are we supposed to be right now, Alpha on the finale?"
"00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,509",Rice: Yeah. You wanna look at the...
"00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,312",Schafer: When is beta on B2 and G2? Is that there?
"00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,781","Rice: Yeah, so we'll show you the timeline as it is right now."
"00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:06,719","Um, but Matt and Vic and I, and Malena are gonna meet this afternoon now, uh,"
"00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,423","and want to get a lot more clarity into just closing out the project,"
"00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:14,160","but also, like, these beta sprints and--and things like that as well."
"00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,764","Hansen: Right now there's a tendency for people to gravitate towards whatever is the, you know,"
"00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:22,769","maybe the most interesting work, and that's not-- might not be the most, uh, highest priority work."
"00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:26,739","We just need to do some load balancing and some estimates as far as, like, how long is it gonna take"
"00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,876","to get this shit done, 'cause people-- if people don't tell us that,"
"00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:32,045",we might be fucked already and we don't even know it.
"00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,813","Rice: Um, but, yes, Ray, you're correct."
"00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:40,753","The, um, the right reaction to this is, it's a lot to do in two-- in two months and change."
"00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:44,023","Crook: Yeah. Rice: So, um, I think that's why we wanted to make sure that these dates"
"00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,826",get in front of everybody's eyes and that people are looking at it differently.
"00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,329","Hansen: Is it reasonable? I mean, or are you-- or you're like, I don't know, man,"
"00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,666",'cause your gut checks are usually pretty good.
"00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,735",Crook: Wow.
"00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:58,104","Yeah, but I think it's-- I think it'd be all right."
"00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,773","Do you think the GPs are gonna be--I mean, 'cause there was a time where"
"00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,775",there were gonna be four of them.
"00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,477",Now there's two of them.
"00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:10,550","Rice: We're getting all the box stuff ready to go and actually manufacturing in, like, February, um,"
"00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,253",to where discs would be pressed in mid-March.
"00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,824","Kipnis: Yeah, and the game--does the game run on the PS4?"
"00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,692",Franzke: Nope. Kipnis: Yeah.
"00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:25,865","And--and I think it's really important to have a, ""Okay, Tim, this is it, like, you can't..."""
"00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:30,770","Hansen: Yeah. Kipnis: Like, absolute content complete from, like, Tim content complete maybe."
"00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,105",Hansen: Last call for alcohol.
"00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,272","Kipnis: Yeah, last call."
"00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,242","Let's just call it that, last call."
"00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:40,213","It's really hard to, as a creator, to turn yourself off."
"00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:44,817",What I want to do is be able to account for that and I want Tim to be able to do that.
"00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,720","I want him to be able to, like, ""Oh, God, this is it, that's right,"
"00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,225","I can't add anymore after this."" And I want him to be able to, like, have that time"
"00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:56,562","and account for it in our--in our milestone, like, timeline and stuff."
"00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,799","Because I want him to be, like, happy with what we come up with."
"00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:06,405","Because we know his creative process, it's important for us to schedule it appropriately."
"00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:10,343","Rice: Yeah, um... Kipnis: Yeah, I didn't realize, like, how soon the beta was."
"00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:15,014","Jesus Christ. Rice: Yeah, and I don't know, Matt, like, right now every-- there's a lot of hands on Grim,"
"00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:18,151","but, like, obviously that's just a near-term problem that's being solved soon."
"00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:23,689","But after that, um, yeah, I don't know what kind of, uh, strings"
"00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,693","we can pull with people on other teams, um, as needed."
"00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,797","Hansen: They can't. I mean, we have milestones. We won't get paid."
"00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,165",If we don't get paid then the studio shuts down.
"00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,866",Rice: That's what I thought.
"00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,301",So I was just making sure that that was the case.
"00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,404","Hansen: I'm just gonna be totally blunt with you guys, but you can't touch (redacted)."
"00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,872",Kipnis: Yeah. Hansen: I'm sorry.
"00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,474",Franzke: Yeah.
"00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:42,742",All right. Rice: Cool.
"00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:43,776","Franzke: Let's make this happen, huh?"
"00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,878",Rice: Yeah. All right.
"00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,147","Like, you guys are the right people to ask about this."
"00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,416",Like what--what does gut say about the timeline?
"00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,319",It's basically two months till pencils down.
"00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:58,157","Inversin: I'm not totally scared just yet, but I might be terrified."
"00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,226",We'll see.
"00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:03,763",[Offscreen] Did you get to learn anything from Lydia when she was still here?
"00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,231",Panya: No.
"00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:09,769","She had a lot of the Act 1 shader stuff, so, like, her signature's over everything"
"00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,737",so I can pick up where she left off in that sense.
"00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:15,241","Uh, but she's not here for me to kind of ask questions."
"00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:19,011","Scheduling with effects is always kind of scary, 'cause there's always this, you know,"
"00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:23,382","four-week window at the end for polish, and, of course everybody wants to polish at the end,"
"00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,519","even design wants to polish, and that trickles down."
"00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,857","Animations get tweaked at the end, and then visual effects and sound effects"
"00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:34,694","are the last two guys to kind of get, uh, to touch it."
"00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:40,600","So as long as everyone knows that the sound effects and the visual effects guys are last and they give some buffer,"
"00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,402","then we shouldn't be too, uh, too screwed."
"00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:49,041",Stoddard: I want to make sure German gets hit because we have to re-volume graph
"00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:56,082","and re-special effects process all of the German recording for Act 1 and Act 2, and that's a tall order."
"00:16:56,082 --> 00:17:01,854","Rice: Yeah, and it's getting delivered beginning of February, right, and then don't we--is the plan to have outsourcer on it"
"00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,556","that should take, like, three weeks?"
"00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,258",Stoddard: We--yeah. Hansen: We have Ashley coming in.
"00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,792","Stoddard: Yeah. Hansen: And she'll be, uh, helping..."
"00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:09,794",-...specifically for this work. Rice: Yeah.
"00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:13,699",Schafer: I would like to ask you to join me in welcoming Ashley Coull to Double Fine.
"00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,834",There she is over there.
"00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,103",Ashley.
"00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:21,807","Coull: You know, a contract. It's a short amount of time and, you know, there-- there's no--there's no guarantee,"
"00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:25,845","and it was a staggering amount of work as well, but, uh, the opportunity to be here"
"00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:29,715","and be a part of this community, uh, Camden even pulled me out-- pulled me out of work one day,"
"00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:34,553","and I think he got about halfway through the sentence of, ""Hey, so there's this contract thing,"" and I was like, ""Yes."""
"00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:40,826","And he was like, ""I--uh, yeah,"" and I was like, ""Yeah."" Um, and that's kind of how--how"
"00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,828","the balls got--got rolling, I guess."
"00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:46,532","Schafer: Because we have German VO in the game, which is awesome, and it sounds crazy. I started playing it."
"00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,735","I mean, I don't mean crazy, I mean in a language that is not my own."
"00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,737",-German Vella: Hallo? Schafer: There we go.
"00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,274","[Coughing] That's a German cough, obviously."
"00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:59,045",[Disproving sigh] [Laughter]
"00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:02,148",I really like the German version. I'm gonna play through the whole thing in German.
"00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:05,184","Stoddard: Yeah, that was-- that was a-- the was a big, big thing,"
"00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,154","so she's just-- she's kicking ass, Paul is kicking ass."
"00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,555",He really is stepping up.
"00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,358","I mean, it's like kind of both their moments to step up."
"00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,794","O'Rourke: I mean, it's always enjoyable. Tim's writing is hilarious most of the time"
"00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:17,063","and it's really good to just-- like, usually when I'm editing--"
"00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,165","I don't want to talk bad about, like, sports games or anything,"
"00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,367","but if I had to edit, like, Madden dialogue all day,"
"00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,468",probably kill myself.
"00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,204",But going through Tim's stuff is actually pretty enjoyable.
"00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,207","Um, I gave him a huge cut scene the other day."
"00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,376","Dude, here's a big moment, go do it,"
"00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,345",come back when it's done.
"00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:35,815",And he came back and it was damn near perfect.
"00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:39,485","Like he nailed it, so I'm like, okay, I'm not worried anymore."
"00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,623","The layoffs were not good, um..."
"00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:47,793",It's definitely-- This--this company is under stress.
"00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:52,765","Everybody is being super pro and they're making good product, but, like, it's-- it's heavy duty right now."
"00:18:52,765 --> 00:19:00,639","And I'm just really happy to see this team kind of gel, uh, you know, in the trenches and really get it."
"00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,775",Me?
"00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:12,018",(speaking in German) [Offscreen] What was that? Franzke: I--what?
"00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:19,492","[Laughter] Coull: Uh, I said I'm editing all the German lines."
"00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,793",Franzke: Can I read-- can I read this?
"00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,631",[Laughter] Franzke: Oh.
"00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,467","Rice: We've gone through this now with all the leads, yeah,"
"00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,137","but, um, yeah, now we wanted to present it it to you."
"00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:34,040",The next week is-- Schafer: Last set call.
"00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,841",Rice: Huh? Schafer: Tim last call...
"00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,343","Rice: Yeah, we'll get to that."
"00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,814","So like, tomorrow the hope is during stand-ups to, like, relay this whole thing to the entire team,"
"00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,315",not just the leads.
"00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,651","And I feel like we gotta kinda give, like,"
"00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:49,688","a bit of a sense of urgency and just, like, that kind of thing."
"00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:54,827","But I feel like it's also trying to put people's fears to rest, which would--I think one of the big ones is that,"
"00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,629","like, we're gonna continue to iterate on the game..."
"00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:00,166",-...and things like that. Schafer: So terrify them with the deadlines and put all their fears to rest.
"00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:05,471","Rice: And then hopefully, uh, just pep rally, pump people up?"
"00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:10,843","Schafer: If we use the words ""dig deep"" at any point, I'm just-- Hansen: Will you say it? Schafer: No."
"00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:13,279","Rice: No. Schafer: There's always a point where someone talks about digging deep,"
"00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,482",and I just-- I don't want to say that.
"00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:17,817","So we all gotta dig deep, you guys."
"00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:21,053","Hansen: All right. Rice: Yeah, I pro-- I think I might put the dates"
"00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,824","on the whiteboard again, too, just so everyone can look at them all the time."
"00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,826","Schafer: If they view that, they'll film it."
"00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:27,827","Rice: Yeah, red, white, and blue."
"00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,795",Romero: That's encouraging.
"00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,031","Broken Age, fuck yeah."
"00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,669",Schafer: Does that help?
"00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,338",Romero: Tim last call. Is that a milestone?
"00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,840",Rice: Fuck yes. Romero: Okay.
"00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,877",We submit to ratings boards on the fourth?
"00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:48,481","Rice: Yeah, I think it's that-- Kipnis: When do we know what line...?"
"00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:52,017","Crook: Tim said he would try to call him. When he said you're hitting the line, it's okay."
"00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:55,721",Maybe I just gotta try to find one that...
"00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:59,425",Rice: Ready? So we've been meeting production team with the leads
"00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,161",to come up with closing plan stuff.
"00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:06,265","So next Friday we have our next Sony milestone, which Oliver is working on."
"00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,768",I think the big thing is PlayStation 4 running.
"00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,837",Schafer: Is there anything on there new or shocking to anyone?
"00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,706","Crook: It's all shocking, but nothing's new."
"00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,241",There's nothing new.
"00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:17,743","Schafer: There is a lot of stuff to do in a short amount of time,"
"00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,846","but there's no big unknowns to me, at least, on it."
"00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:26,552","There's no design yet to do, dialogue yet to write, and big ques--"
"00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:31,190","things that could explode into-- I mean, like, it seems like it's a known amount of work now"
"00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:38,130","that can't expand, and, um, and it's clear that it can't slip"
"00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,866",because you can see the commitments that are on it.
"00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:45,771","As far as I'm concerned, like, everything is just no-- everything just has to be pushed through the machinery,"
"00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:50,442","and that's the easy part, except for it's hard."
"00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:54,280","No, we're--we're the dream team, all here together."
"00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,150","For some reason, to me it's always relaxing when it's finite even if it is tight"
"00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,452",because you know when it's gonna be over.
"00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:04,823",These next three weeks are really where the game goes from being good to great mostly.
"00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:12,031","So, um, it's gonna be exciting and, uh, if we have to order food,"
"00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,799",we'll order food.
"00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,234",Crook: Food.
"00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:16,836",Boston Market?
"00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:20,306","Schafer: No. Crook: Promise Boston Market, I'll-- Schafer: Wait, you want Boston-- Crook: I'll work late if you--"
"00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:21,473","No, I'm just kidding. Kipnis: Wow."
"00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,677",Crook: Just kidding.
"00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,746","Schafer: If you've gotta lure a man away from his family, make it Boston Market."
"00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,215",Crook: Yeah.
"00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,749",Schafer: It's like there's love in that meal.
"00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,752",Kipnis: That's--that's what Caroline did for us during Psychonauts.
"00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,387",Remember that? Rice: Boston Market?
"00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,590","Kipnis: Boston Market, like, every night."
"00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,293","Crook: Yep. Kipnis: And, uh, and I gained-- I gained, like, 15 pounds during during crunch."
"00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,761",Schafer: That's to keep you in your seat.
"00:22:43,380 --> 00:23:11,290","[Music] Schafer: Uh, on ""Reds,"" we did a whole play-through of the team"
"00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:16,495","of the finale of the game to figure out how to push that towards, um, completion."
"00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:21,400",We are also starting on the PS4 version.
"00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,536","Hansen: So we have a milestone on the 23rd, and that's to have it, like,"
"00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:28,807","""playable,"" um, on that platform, so-- But it looks like that's come along really well,"
"00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,377","so good job, Oliver."
"00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:34,680",Schafer: Look at it playing on the PS4.
"00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,049",[Offscreen] How's the port process been going in general?
"00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:40,519",Franzke: It's good. We essentially added PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita
"00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,689","to a list of platforms, but kept the ship date the same,"
"00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:46,725","um, so that makes things a bit more interesting."
"00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,695","I love working on consoles, but it's a very different kind of challenge, like,"
"00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:54,466","for example, the Vita is very memory constrained, um, so that, you know,"
"00:23:54,466 --> 00:24:01,874","it's--it's a very tight memory budget for--for the game, and if you're just leaking some memory somewhere,"
"00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:05,744","like, you're gonna have a bad time later on, so there are, like, a lot of really interesting things"
"00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,413",you need to take into consideration.
"00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,748",Or can you compress the data in some way and stuff like that.
"00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,785","And I think the end-- the end will be tough, for sure, shipping."
"00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:18,991","Like, so, for--for consoles, um, what you have to do in order to release games"
"00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:21,560",is you have to go to something that's called certifications.
"00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:27,032","The next milestone is on the 20th, which is-- like, it's very ominously called, like, beta"
"00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:31,370","which is supposed to be TRC complete, uh, essentially for Sony"
"00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,039",so there's a lot of stuff that needs to happen before that.
"00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:38,777",Those are all the requirements you need for shipping a game on a--on a Sony platform.
"00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,012",Schafer: I'm sure we're TRC complete.
"00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,214","Franzke: Oh, yeah, no problem."
"00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:48,754","Um, so they will essentially, like, run a game and make sure that every one of those requirements is met."
"00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:53,425",[Offscreen] How does stuff like Assassin's Creed happen?
"00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,195","Oliver: Uh, I'd rather not comment on that."
"00:24:56,195 --> 00:25:00,399","It's really sad, because I'm pretty sure all the people who worked on the game, you know,"
"00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,736",didn't want to release something that's substandard.
"00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:08,273","Um, so very often, it's--it's-- actually really sad for the developers,"
"00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:12,678","but there's a lot of, like, pressure from various departments"
"00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,647",to make the game happen essentially.
"00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,117",Are you feeling some form of pressure like that now?
"00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:23,088","Well, I mean, but if you-- if you don't have a publisher who's, like, does what, uh, needs to happen,"
"00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:29,228","but as you can see, everything is so tightly packed, uh, that there's really no time to slip any of those milestones."
"00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,832","Franzke: Yes, please. -Okay."
"00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,267","See, crunch has already started."
"00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:38,404","Schafer: Yeah, we're getting near the end where some nights people are working late"
"00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:41,874","and we're ordering food, and, um..."
"00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,777",and hopefully that won't be too long till it's over.
"00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:47,813","And people who are staying late now, it's 'cause they want to make sure the game is really good."
"00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:59,324",[Music] I know the biggest hurdle is just the amount
"00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,193",of work there is to do.
"00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:04,830","Uh, we have to do a whole bunch of cut scenes."
"00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,098",Still have to go in.
"00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:10,269","Crook: Camden there was the issue with, uh, Bob Chothra coming out of the mountain"
"00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:13,872",that we were gonna-- did you talk to Tim about that and Peter?
"00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,041",I don't know about-- I'm in that scene still.
"00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:19,244","We're making some changes, so I just-- Stoddard: Okay."
"00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,013",Schafer: Just saying that gave Ray a headache.
"00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:24,249","Offscreen: How is the ending cut scene coming along, since that was sort of, uh-- that had to be--"
"00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,151","the music had to be done, so that was kind of locked."
"00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:30,389","Schafer: Yeah, yeah, 'cause we kind of locked it, but I feel good about the pacing of that, just based on the music."
"00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:35,594","Um, and it was so big we had to split it between two animators, Miyuki and Chris Lam."
"00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,864",So Miyuki was doing the first half and Chris was doing the second half.
"00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:41,333",And then we're gonna stitch it back together.
"00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,534","Oh, I like that. That's a good idea."
"00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:43,569","Crook: Yeah, that was really good."
"00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:45,003",That's cute.
"00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:52,010","Richardson: Like, uh, so many characters, and..."
"00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,145","and it's kind of a big thing, right?"
"00:26:53,145 --> 00:27:00,385","It's ending, end of the game, so that's kind of exciting, but still goin' like,"
"00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:04,690","""Ooh, that's a lot of things to do."" Crook: Maybe not the happy eyes? Lam: No."
"00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:09,394","Schafer: Yeah, like, the delirious eyes, like yay, he's more like..."
"00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,230",Hm.
"00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,700","""You run, I got this."" Crook: All right. Schafer: ""Save yourself."""
"00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,468",Thumb's up.
"00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,505","Crook: Yeah, he got that on film. We might need to..."
"00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,773","Schafer: This ping pong ball, his face."
"00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:26,845","Lam: The parts that I have to do that are kind of those, you know, resolution moments,"
"00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:32,317",they're gonna be a little challenging but-- to get the expressions on the characters right
"00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:37,055","so that you know that they're thinking, they're not just staring into dead space and stuff like that."
"00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,790",Crook: Think you got enough info there?
"00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,825",Okay. Lam: Yes.
"00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:43,595","Crook: The plan is to just take it to that, um, shippable stage."
"00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:49,635","And then, uh, that will allow all the effects and the sound to get put in, um, 'cause all the timing will be locked down."
"00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:53,539","So the--the plan is that they'll go back to it, uh, to do some polish, um,"
"00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,073",after we get all the content in.
"00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,742",Schafer: Is this a good time to look at it?
"00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:59,478","It would be a good time to look at it, yes."
"00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:03,048","It doesn't--sometimes it seems like in that whole thing, there's not a shot that shows--"
"00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:06,418",that really shows the entire scene.
"00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,854","Schafer: But, I mean, you know what's left and you know what's right."
"00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,556","Crook: Yeah, like, this is the only shot we have."
"00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:15,227","Rice: That's the shot that shows most-- Crook: What--uh, I don't know."
"00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:18,830","I just kept thinking that, like-- You could almost do-- Rice: if it's a flip book,"
"00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,166",you could almost--you could have other people that we don't know
"00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,235",that are on the sides from both villages.
"00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:24,870","Crook: All these people, like here."
"00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,705","Schafer: But where do they come from? Crook: Well, they came from..."
"00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,075","Rice: From the monster lands town, like, there's a big battle going on."
"00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,843",They've come to gawk.
"00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:37,349","Crook: That's fine. I mean, if you're-- But we--but we can't-- we don't want..."
"00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,117","-...to animate more people. Stoddard: Yeah, yeah, I know."
"00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,219",Rice: But that's what you're saying. Schafer: It's really important not to add features to the game
"00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,654",at this point Ray.
"00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,856",I like the melting you're adding.
"00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:47,826",I wouldn't jump to that melting platform.
"00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:48,794","Crook: Yeah, that's true. She has no shoes."
"00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:51,396",Camden: She's tough. She's a baker.
"00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,399",Crook: She walks on coals. Schafer: She doesn't use oven mitts anymore.
"00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,401","Oh, that's good. That's perfect."
"00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,573",So I think this would be-- this needs something here.
"00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:06,445","Inversin: It--it has something, not in this scene, but there is-- I can--I can move it into that scene also if you want."
"00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,347",Schafer: 'Cause it seemed like he was backing up from nothing.
"00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,616","Inversin: So, like, it's in there, too, so I can add it to the other one."
"00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,217","Schafer: I just think it--think it could be, like, half as much?"
"00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,619",Crook: That looks really cool.
"00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:16,188",Schafer: It kind of explains why he jumps now.
"00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,557",That's perfect. I think that's perfect as far as the rain goes.
"00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,758",-Awesome. -Yeah.
"00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,792",-Then we're done. -Yeah.
"00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,060",That was easy.
"00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,195","Boop boop. Yeah, that was really good."
"00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,130",Thanks.
"00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,036","Oh, crying for us."
"00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:34,573",Crook: Yeah.
"00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:42,481","[Music] Rice: But we're finally now getting down to-- to final days, I guess."
"00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:54,793","[Music] Crook: But, yeah, we're all a little on edge, a little stressed out,"
"00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,262","but, um, it'll be okay."
"00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:03,602","Hansen: Anna's here almost constantly, and, you know, I can-- I see the light at the end of the tunnel."
"00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:08,140","We love these games, but, you know, we all kind of need to take a break."
"00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,075","And people need to get some sleep, too."
"00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:12,711",It's been a rough few months.
"00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:16,615","Crook: I mean, we're gonna be pushing to the very end."
"00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:19,184",[Off screen] Like that guy there. Crook: Oh yeah he is.
"00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,019",I think he didn't go home last night.
"00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,855","But apparently he has, like, a little bed over there."
"00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,425","So I'm just like, that's not a good thing."
"00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,793",Stoddard: I don't want to romanticize it.
"00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:30,729","I know--I know that Tim wants to show how the sausage gets made,"
"00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:35,500",and this has been-- this has been hard.
"00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,372","Schafer: We're also getting kind of griefed by, um, certain fringe organizations"
"00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:44,476","and attack groups organized, and, uh, that was a bummer."
"00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,611",And then we had the layoffs which were a huge bummer.
"00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:50,649","And, um, a bunch of bad news."
"00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:56,755","Rice: There is, like, a group of people that are hoping that we won't succeed for some weird reason,"
"00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:59,858","um, or that are at least heavily scrutinizing us."
"00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,061",And it definitely has been something that's been weighing on a lot of people.
"00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:07,733","Franzke: The endless thing of, like, people, like, oh, well, maybe they shouldn't have taken the--the money"
"00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:11,703","and only make half the game. Well, you know, all I can say to that is, like,"
"00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:15,841","if you would be, like, we're sitting here, you know, working our asses off to make this game."
"00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,375","Kipnis: And, like, you do, you question yourself."
"00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,812","Like, yeah, maybe we-- what the fuck, maybe we don't know what the--what we're doing."
"00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,514",Who knows?
"00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:25,383","But you just have to trust and know, like, this is actually-- game development"
"00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,486",is not an easy thing.
"00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:30,856","Schafer: And now we're gonna ship Broken Age, and that's all gonna be great."
"00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:35,060","So, um, it's a relief to get out of that-- out of that period."
"00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,134",[Offscreen] What's going on right now at this stage of the project?
"00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:46,271","Romero: So where we are is, we're less than a month out from our first submission,"
"00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:50,675","which is the, um, where you submit to Sony and we release the mastering for the PC,"
"00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,844",physical copies that we're doing with Nordic.
"00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:58,083",So the 20th is the big day where just everything has to sort of be done by that point.
"00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:03,789","Rice: Uh, yes, I've been working on some Nordic stuff, too, along with Vic. Um... We got the box prints"
"00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:07,092","from them and they just look a little bit dark so we're doing, like, another round on those"
"00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,694",before they actually start printing them in bulk.
"00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,596","Uh, but hopefully that'll happen soon."
"00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,332",Schafer: But we don't get a sample before they make a zillion of them?
"00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,134","Rice: No, unfortunately. Schafer: Exciting."
"00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,169",Rice: Yeah. Schafer: That's exciting.
"00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:19,304",This is just one of Cory's mock-ups of the box.
"00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,006",This is the box.
"00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,674",This is--the disc's not gonna look like that.
"00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,576",I wanted the disc to be the O from Broken Age.
"00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,245","This is gonna be like the O, and that's the box."
"00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:31,483","And we're first looking at it, we're like, this is cool 'cause it shows the split thing,"
"00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:36,621","but it really overemphasizes Vella over Shay, 'cause Shay's upside down so he's, like, easier to ignore."
"00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,090","It was like, wouldn't it be crazy if we could print Vella and Shay"
"00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,527","on a separate clear slipcover, and then you could slide it off"
"00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:46,731","and turn it around and slide it back down and then Shay would be in Vella's world and vice versa,"
"00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:50,335","Which, no spoilers, but that's some foreshadowing there."
"00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,403",And it would be so neat.
"00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:52,771",It would be like Led Zeppelin.
"00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:53,872",Rice: We'll nail it. It'll be great.
"00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,074",-Um... Kipnis: Wow.
"00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:03,615",Romero: So right now the big tasks are-- or the big areas are bugs.
"00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:07,185","O'Rourke: Yeah, we're in Starship Troopers mode basically, just killing all the bugs."
"00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:10,689","Schafer: Taking showers together or what are you-- Coull: No. Schafer: I'm sorry, that's..."
"00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:11,857",not the first thing I think about.
"00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:16,294",O'Rouke: There's the daily shower scene in the audio room.
"00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:19,164",Kipnis: I'm a little bit concerned about our deadline.
"00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,100","Like, right here it says A and B bugs only."
"00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,537","Like, that's not likely gonna happen, especially since we have brand new cut scenes."
"00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:26,605",Schafer: Starting now or next week?
"00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:27,672",Kipnis: Next week.
"00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:32,677","Uh, that's likely not happening because we have a bunch of new, um, cut scenes coming."
"00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:38,016",Content is still coming in and we can't actually do that until all content is in the game.
"00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,551",Schafer: What's this selective bug fixing?
"00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:43,755",Almost sounds more open-ended than A and B 'cause we select to do a C.
"00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,056","Right, that's how that works?"
"00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,625",Kipnis: Nope. Rice: I don't think so.
"00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:49,794","Kipnis: But if you play the game all the way through, um, from Act 1,"
"00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:54,165","that Act 1 is very clean, and we have to make Act 2 look that clean,"
"00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,668",and that's a lot of C-bug fixing.
"00:33:56,668 --> 00:34:00,105","And so, like, we can't suddenly switch to A and Bs only next week."
"00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:04,309","Like, it's just not-- it's gonna be basically like a, I don't know,"
"00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:07,312","not a very clean game, I guess."
"00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:12,583","Romero: Uh, Act 2 is interesting because we're not just doing PC, Mac, and Linux digital,"
"00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:16,755","um, we're doing physical, when--and really that goes back to the old school way,"
"00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:21,226","which is you get to the point in the project where you're gonna ship a physical disc,"
"00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,527",you have to cut off bug fixing.
"00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:25,496","You have to be certain that the build you're shipping is the one,"
"00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:29,868","because someone's gonna, in theory, buy the box and get the game,"
"00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:34,806","and that has to have all the, you know, be bug-free as-- as bug-free as possible and as solid as possible,"
"00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:38,109",so they'll just have the disc and the game that's on there.
"00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,444",That's it.
"00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:42,746",Kipnis: I don't have confidence at the moment that we have--we're really
"00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:45,349",at the bug count that we are.
"00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:49,554","Or, like, I--I expect that the bugs will increase tremendously,"
"00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,690","or should, because I think they are in there."
"00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,358",Romero: They're still there. Kipnis: Yeah.
"00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,360","Franzke: It's still gonna be good, like, I mean, this game has been out for such a long time, I think"
"00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,431","it's gonna be stable and it's gonna be good, but there's always, like,"
"00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:04,202","so much more that we would have liked to do and, like, we're now at a point where"
"00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,503",that's just not gonna be possible.
"00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:08,773","We need to, you know, make sure that the game is stable."
"00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:12,644","You know, you look-- you look at your bug database and you list some issues that you have in there"
"00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:16,781","and it's, like, a lot, and it's like, how are we gonna be able to--to finish that?"
"00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:28,560","We'll have to probably do some bug triaging next week to just see kind of, okay, well, all of these issues"
"00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,765","that are in the bug database right now, which one are we realistically gonna be able to even do now?"
"00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:37,202",And then they have to-- there will have to be some hard decisions.
"00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:41,606","It's like, okay, well, we can only do one or the other, so which one of these issues,"
"00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,808",polish items is more important to you?
"00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:46,811",And then we're gonna do that but not the other.
"00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,147",And it's just the nature of the beast.
"00:35:49,640 --> 00:36:07,198",[Music] Hansen: Resources in 12. Schafer: That would be great.
"00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:11,136","Uh, and yeah, we'll have to re-- and I mean, obviously,"
"00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,638",analyze the bugs every day and how they're tracking.
"00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,407",Are all the GPs back from sickness?
"00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,175","Hansen: No, Anna's still out. Stoddard: Two down."
"00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,810","Hansen: But-- Schafer: She's gonna be out today, too?"
"00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,779","Hansen: She's trying to get some medicine that'll allow her to work this week,"
"00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,414",so she's that bad.
"00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:23,715",Schafer: Holy cow.
"00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,418",Crook: She was working really late hours.
"00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:28,853",I think she was probably-- Her immune system was already
"00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:35,126","pretty vulnerable, and, um, and she--she got whatever, I don't know."
"00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,528","I hope--I don't know, she hasn't said."
"00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:37,796",She went to the doctor.
"00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:41,032","Hopefully it's not pneumonia or something, but, um,"
"00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,634",hopefully she'll be back with us on Monday.
"00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:46,838",But--but we know that the most important thing for her is just to get better.
"00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,074","You know, it's just a video game."
"00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:52,811","You know, she's, you know, her health is the most important thing,"
"00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:56,314","so, um, so that's why it's been great."
"00:36:56,314 --> 00:37:00,852","Everyone has just jumped in to try and help out, and nobody blames anybody for anything."
"00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:06,157","-It's just one of those things. Boehle: I'll probably just filter, like, Anna's open or new bugs, like, priority two and higher,"
"00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,993","and then if there's anything UI related, I'll just grab those and--"
"00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,728","Franzke: Right. Yeah, I think we have to."
"00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:14,432","I mean, it's just kind of-- sounds like Anna's hit pretty hard."
"00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:17,769","Hansen: But it's still difficult because, you know, there's a lot of ownership over the code,"
"00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:22,607",so Anna will be able to get something done a lot faster than anybody else just 'cause she's so familiar
"00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,843",with all the inner workings of how this stuff is all hooked up.
"00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:28,012","That makes it more difficult, for sure, 'cause all the pressure's on her right now."
"00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:31,182","Rice: I guess at least through the week and then, I just--I guess I wonder when we're gonna get"
"00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:34,719","to other platform work, but for now it's obvious."
"00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,287",It seems like this is until we're locking stuff down.
"00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,724","Franzke: I mean, like, whenever there's an actual pre-cert issue coming in from Sony,"
"00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,861","I'm jumping on it right away because I want to get them,"
"00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:44,129","like, fixed as soon as possible."
"00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:45,430",But so far it's been pretty good.
"00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,000",I think actually not that many bugs been reported from pre-certs.
"00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,136","Rice: So, yeah, whathaveibeenworkingon? We have a couple things."
"00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:54,706",Today we set up a bug triage meeting with all of the leads.
"00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:59,344","So, um, producers and leads and Tim, are gonna kind of read through everything in the bug database,"
"00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:01,813",reevaluating where we are with that.
"00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:03,748",So that'll be happening this afternoon.
"00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,784","Schafer: Hey, everybody, hello. Rice: Hi."
"00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,387","Schafer: This is probably the last meeting of the project, right?"
"00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,788",Rice: Um... Probably not.
"00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,590","Schafer: We're so close. Rice: Big one, though."
"00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,794",Rice: It's a big one. Franzke: Apart from the meeting where we get all the royalty checks?
"00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,228","Schafer: Yeah, that's after. That's after."
"00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,497","We have to ship it first, Oliver."
"00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:23,801","But yeah, so we're gonna look over the bug database and see if we can get rid of some bugs."
"00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:28,106",Rice: I think the hope is really just trying to get an idea of which ones we definitely need to fix
"00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:29,841",and which ones might be okay to drop.
"00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:37,315","And this is specifically for the date in two weeks from now, which is like pressing it to the disc for PC."
"00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:43,621","So I guess it's, like, what are we gonna not feel comfortable having fixed before that disc is pressed."
"00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,023",And how bad is the situation right now?
"00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:47,225",'Cause I'm hearing things like the bugs aren't gonna be fixed
"00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:48,393",by the ship date and all that.
"00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:52,197","I mean, from Vic's last email, it sounds like we're tracking about half the speed"
"00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:55,300","um, that we would need to be for fixing these 250."
"00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:00,805","Um, I guess it's just, like, what's the line we can draw where we're comfortable that it's a solid build"
"00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,541",that's not gonna crash that gives a good experience.
"00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,844","And, yeah, maybe there's, like, some polish stuff that would have been nice to be in there"
"00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:11,049",but at least it's in versions that get patched.
"00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:14,052","Hansen: I mean, every game that ships ships with bugs, period."
"00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,753","They're--I mean, it's just unavoidable."
"00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,422",You can keep testing a game forever.
"00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,757",It's just you have to get to the point where you feel like
"00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:23,995","you found things that are-- you know, that most people are likely to run into"
"00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,530",and you've addressed all that stuff.
"00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,132","Rice: Then, like, there's certain cut scenes when you interact with things"
"00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,401",in the spinning mode where she'll then just not be spinning
"00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,503","all of a sudden and talking, then it'll go back into"
"00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:36,207","spinning, like-- Schafer: I haven't seen that. Rice: You haven't seen that?"
"00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,676","Schafer: Okay, we should find those. Rice: I just saw it, like, last night, so..."
"00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:39,811","Crook: Oh, okay."
"00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:42,113",Schafer: What stretching arms show?
"00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:44,515","Crook: When, the wakeup scene? Schafer: Mm-hm."
"00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:48,286","Crook: The arm--It happens twice, when it grabs him and then you can see at the very top,"
"00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:50,855","you can see, like, the arms are all wacky."
"00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,724",Like they're all stretched out and weird.
"00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,692",Schafer: Is it really ugly? Romero: Is that...?
"00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,729",Rice: I think I've seen it. It's like the top point is off the side and then where they come in.
"00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:00,832","Schafer: If you were a player, would you say that's the science fiction, uh..."
"00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:03,134","Crook: It's a sliver of, like, pulled out stuff."
"00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:08,506","Franzke: It is a potentially really risky fix, though, because touching-- Getting that camera to work right in that scene"
"00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,542",was--we spent weeks-- Schafer: It's not just reposing the hand?
"00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:16,080",Franzke: Right. And I really would not feel comfortable messing with the cameras unless we really have to because...
"00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,149",Schafer: Would you fix it with the camera or fix it with the animation?
"00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:21,252",Crook: We can try and change up the animation-- Schafer: But you can't just straighten up the arm.
"00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,155",Crook: That's a scary scene. Schafer: Hm.
"00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:29,160",Crook: We are trying to take things that maybe-- small things that we normally might ask
"00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,831","the game play programmers to do, uh, we're trying to fix those things ourselves"
"00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:36,134",just because they're so swamped.
"00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:38,836",But we're not programmers and we have to be careful.
"00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:40,305",We don't want to break things.
"00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,140",So I'm kind of learning a lot of things.
"00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,376","Um, I'm learning a few things about game play programming."
"00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:50,448",Schafer: What if Ben Peck is super miserable at his new job? Has anyone called him lately?
"00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,817",Crook: I saw--I saw him at GDC. He looked a little miserable.
"00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,586","Schafer: Yeah, see what I'm saying? Crook: That was only 'cause Anna was giving him mean looks."
"00:40:57,255 --> 00:41:00,658",Franzke: I saw him on Friday and he seemed relatively happy.
"00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,794","Schafer: Wait, can we see how many of these we have to go through?"
"00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:06,164","Romero: Uh, so we're at 155."
"00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:08,733",The bottom goes all the way to 252.
"00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:10,201",So we're about a hundred away.
"00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,738","Schafer: Oh, my God."
"00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:20,144","Hansen: We don't have a lot of time in general, so yeah, in aggregate, all that stuff is a lot of work."
"00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:26,050","'Cause what we're trying to do is, like, get to a point where we've addressed everything we're gonna address"
"00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,520",and then have the game sit without anybody working on it.
"00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,157","Just--it's just sitting just in QA for, like, a week."
"00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,260",And that's the hard part 'cause we-- we've already eaten into that week.
"00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,865","And so we're kind of faced with the decision now of, like, do we just work up to the deadline"
"00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:42,600",and just ship what we have?
"00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,335",And there's a huge risk involved with that.
"00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,672","But even, like, the small, minor polish bugs, it's like, you get enough of those"
"00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,408",and it does make a huge impact on the quality of the game.
"00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:52,643","Schafer: Yeah, it looks really bad."
"00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:56,714","Um, when we print this disc, how would people get the patch?"
"00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,116",Franzke: Steam.
"00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:00,551",Schafer: So that's the only way to get the patch for their disc-based version
"00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,719",of the game is by using Steam?
"00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:04,789",Franzke: Yeah. Schafer: They can't download it from our website or anything like that?
"00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:07,058","Franzke: Our infrastructure--like, we would require to have"
"00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:10,828",some kind of login service for people to register accounts.
"00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:16,701",Schafer: That could be a huge consumer thing of them saying I need to--
"00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,670","in order to get the patch, I need to join Steam, and I don't want to join Steam."
"00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,105",I bought this disc. Franzke: Yeah.
"00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:25,510","Schafer: So it's not like in the old days, where a patch was just a bunch of LUA files"
"00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:29,046",that you could just unpack into the directory of your game and it would fix it?
"00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,617","Franzke: We could, but we have no infrastructure for that right now."
"00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:34,385",Schafer: On the server side or in the game?
"00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:39,624",In the game would have to have that kind of-- Franzke: We right now have no software to create an incremental patch.
"00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,797",Schafer: People are gonna freak out.
"00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:48,666","Rice: Yeah, well, we don't want to have to support a whole 'nother platform."
"00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,869","And, like, it would mean, like, building ground up an infrastructure"
"00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:54,705",for them to be able to sign in to something.
"00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:57,875","For us to be able to host something, for us to support a whole 'nother platform."
"00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,312","Schafer: Well, I just think the other stuff is-- like, just 'cause it's hard for us doesn't mean"
"00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,080",we're not gonna have to deal with it as a company.
"00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,850","You know what I mean? Like, as a huge community or PR problem."
"00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:10,988",Rice: This was a red flag waved as soon as we said we were gonna do a box copy.
"00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:14,325","Franzke: Right, I mean, that's one of the first things we talked about is how the patching would work."
"00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:19,030","Rice: Yeah, well, we can handle it case-by-case and give them a DRM free code whenever we have to"
"00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:22,733",for GOG or whatever if you think people care that much about DRM.
"00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,404","Schafer: I mean, probably be they wouldn't notice all these things like a flicking shadow or something under the seat."
"00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:32,410","But it's just that people who buy DRM free copies of games are like, ""I'm not signing on to anything."
"00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,714","I don't want to sign on to Steam."" Rice: Right. Franzke: They hate--they hate Steam."
"00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:39,684","Schafer: And they were loud about that until we made the DRM free version of the game,"
"00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:42,587","the first game, so..."
"00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:44,856",And then what happens if we ship late to Nordic?
"00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:47,125",What does Nordic do if we ship late to them?
"00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,394","Rice: Uh, the disc is late, then all the dates shift."
"00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,562",Schafer: And then what happens?
"00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:53,631",Rice: Then all the dates shift.
"00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,832",Schafer: And then what happens.
"00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:59,770","Rice: Tell Sony and Justin's mad, and, yeah."
"00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:06,377","Rice: Yeah? I'm just trying to balance that out like how bad it would be if-- okay, anyway."
"00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,445",Maybe they wouldn't notice issues.
"00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:10,014",Rice: This is why we never wanted to sim ship a disc.
"00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:12,250","This is why we wanted to, like, have the game out there,"
"00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:16,387","have it be patched and finished before we did. So as soon as we signed a contract to sim ship,"
"00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:19,824",we knew it would mean either finishing it all and having this period
"00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:23,494",or having a build on a disc that wasn't fully patched.
"00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,664",Schafer: Say we slipped the disc date by two weeks.
"00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,401",Does that mean moving that revenue out of the plan for two weeks is Justin's problem
"00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:33,838",or that there's something bigger with Nordic where they have a truck idling
"00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,439",in the loading dock for two weeks?
"00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,642",Rice: It's that. They want us to right now announce a date.
"00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:39,076",And Sony wants us to commit to a date.
"00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,545",Everyone wants us to commit to a date.
"00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:43,347",We've been holding it off because of all these moving pieces.
"00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,250",Schafer: But it sounds like we already are committed to a date if we're saying we can't slip it.
"00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,487","Rice: We haven't totally, but we should and that's what he wants to know."
"00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:52,056",Schafer: Why don't we just move it two weeks and then commit to it?
"00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:53,357",Rice: 'Cause I don't know that Justin can.
"00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,194","They've been talking-- so there's, like, million pieces in place."
"00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,762","Schafer: Like, these are all the ones we know about."
"00:44:57,762 --> 00:45:01,299","I'm talking about there's a bug that we ship on the disc that is, like every--"
"00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:03,267","it's like the elevator, Manny locked in the elevator bug."
"00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:06,837","Rice: Okay. Schafer: Everyone's posting vines about it all over, it's all over Twitter the next day."
"00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,706","And everyone's like, everyone's freaking out about this bug."
"00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:12,743","Say I can't this patch 'cause I bought the disc, or I was dumb enough to buy the disc version."
"00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:17,648","You know, and it's just like we're ripping off everybody and that's the story."
"00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:22,987","And if it's that on one hand or slipping the date by two weeks, I would slip the date by two weeks."
"00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:25,456",But I want to know what's the consequence of that?
"00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:26,824","Rice: Yeah, we'll talk about it after."
"00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,726",Schafer: Yeah.
"00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,297","Romero: Uh, all right, almost to the forest."
"00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:34,832",Let's see.
"00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:37,368",Rice: That was the first thing I thought when we had that conversation.
"00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:39,837","I was like, oh, is there wiggle room in their production schedule"
"00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,872","for, uh, the box?"
"00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:45,376","And I looked, and no, their drop dead is, like, the 24th."
"00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:49,146","And that's why they wanted it on the 20th so they could, like, prepare everything."
"00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:56,120","Uh, so it would mean pushing the box date out, which I think, since it would be our fault for delivering a build later"
"00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,855",that we'd have to push everything.
"00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:02,727","'Cause I think, like, if we delivered the build on time and they were the reason that the box showed up late,"
"00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:05,196",then we could have shipped and not have it sim shipped.
"00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:07,999","But, um, yeah, we have to sim ship with them."
"00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:14,038","Uh, so, yeah, it would mean, um, moving all the other stuff, which is possible."
"00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:18,042","It just is, like, going back to everybody and making sure that they're okay with it."
"00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:21,212","And especially since Anna's been out all week, it's made it even trickier."
"00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:25,650","We've got, like, all the other programmers piling on now to try and help out."
"00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:32,156","So that's helping, but, yeah, I mean, I guess we're still gonna end up with looking like"
"00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:35,826",at least another week or two of game play bugs.
"00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:39,330","There's just also this unknown question of, like, is there a big bug that we're missing"
"00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,765",that we don't know about?
"00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:46,404","I think that Tim is a little bit worried about, like, our patching solution on the disc, too,"
"00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:51,609","and even if that's, like, um, gonna be well met by customers."
"00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:54,278","Yeah, I guess the question is whether we are gonna be okay with"
"00:46:54,278 --> 00:47:02,086",now rolling out to all of our partners and potentially having to move it back a week or two.
"00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:04,121","Bailey: Yeah, I mean, that's problematic."
"00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:07,858",We--it's in our best interests to stick to the April 28th date.
"00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:14,031","Rice: Mm-hm. Bailey: So, um, it's just there's not a whole lot of wiggle room left."
"00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:19,370","Rice: Yeah. Hansen: Yeah, he's trying to-- he's trying to lay out the whole thing to Justin."
"00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:23,708","I mean, honestly, what we've got to do is present options for Justin."
"00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:25,676","You know, there's pros and cons for each one of them, right?"
"00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,879",And it's--we need to make a business decision on this.
"00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:35,319","Bailey: Because it's a double hit for us to, like, take on more expense for Broken Age to go a week longer."
"00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:38,255","But then also not to have the money that's being brought in, so..."
"00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:43,694","Hansen: You know, Tim's already made his decision, but, you know, Justin needs to weigh in on it also"
"00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,263","because there's a lot at stake for this, so..."
"00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:51,102","There's ramifications of all these decisions, but, I mean, we want to push for the one that's gonna give"
"00:47:51,102 --> 00:47:53,170",the highest quality game at the end.
"00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:59,110","Rice: Yeah, the question is whether we can maybe just push the date back of starting burning all of those discs"
"00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:03,013","and still make the 28th, because the rest of it actually looks like"
"00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:10,154",it's kinda on track for the 28th as far as digital release across all of our other platforms.
"00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:13,090",So I don't think that really affects the digital dates.
"00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:17,394","Hansen: One week of bug fixing and then one week of-- you know, nobody's touching the build."
"00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,796","Rice: Yeah, exactly. Hansen: It's just in QA."
"00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:24,435","Rice: If we can go to them and see if they can move their date for manufacturing back and not touch the final date,"
"00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:26,003",then that seems like it should be good.
"00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:28,873","Bailey: Okay. I mean hearing this, you know, you're probably right."
"00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:31,008","Let's just go ahead and, um..."
"00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:36,614",I think it'd be good to maybe just even get a call and just get all the major stakeholders on the line at once
"00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:40,484",and then we can talk about what the date's looking like and then talk about some stuff
"00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:43,854",that we can give as well and figure it out.
"00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:47,758","Hansen: I almost don't want to, like-- the way we phrase this is kind of important 'cause we don't want to, like,"
"00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,794","ask them as much as like, we have to do this."
"00:48:49,794 --> 00:48:51,695","I don't see an alternative, so. Bailey: We're just telling them."
"00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:54,598","Hansen: About getting them onboard. Bailey: We're like, ""Hey, we're in the production, you know,"
"00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,735","so we're definitely not gonna make the five weeks that's, you know, ideal for you guys."
"00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:58,736",Hansen: Yeah.
"00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:16,520","[Music] Um, so I guess we can start any time,"
"00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,322","uh, any time you want."
"00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:20,825","Bailey: Um, are you guys okay-- we have our camera crew."
"00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:22,827",They want to film this for the documentary.
"00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:28,799","So are you guys okay with being on camera, or your voices being on tape?"
"00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,434",Nordic Rep: Sure.
"00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:35,406","Bailey: The bad news is that we had about a five week, um..."
"00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:39,310","On your production schedule, it had five weeks out when we actually gave you guys the build,"
"00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:44,682","like, for us to actually get the build to you, and for you then to be able to get this pressed."
"00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:50,221","So with the bugs and other things we're running up against now, it looks like--"
"00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:53,324","I don't know if we're gonna need to go right up against that deadline,"
"00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:57,495",but we're gonna need more time than the five weeks we planned for
"00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,763",in that schedule you guys sent over.
"00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:04,235",Rice: I think the date we know we'd be confident at having a stable build ready for you to press disc
"00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:06,070",is April third.
"00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:10,441","So, yeah, I guess that's where the question comes in is if there's a little bit more wiggle room on your guys' side"
"00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:15,212",to try and push back that disc pressing date a little bit.
"00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:18,382","Nordic Rep: So you're saying April third would be ready to replicate, right?"
"00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:19,650",Rice: Yeah.
"00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:28,759","Nordic Rep: Well, I mean, that would give us enough time for an April 28th release."
"00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:29,793",Bailey: Good. Rice: Cool.
"00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:31,795",That's what we were hoping.
"00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,397",Bailey: Yay. All right.
"00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,766","Rice: Okay. So, yeah, I guess we just didn't know if there was, like, buffer"
"00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:39,470",built into that schedule or not.
"00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:43,374","Nordic Rep: I mean, it's tight, you know."
"00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:46,043",Rice: Sounds great. Hansen: That'd be awesome.
"00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,646","Nordic Rep: But let me--you know, if we can--you know, if that's a reliable date,"
"00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:53,017","if April 3 is reliable, you know, then I'm cool with it, you know."
"00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:58,756","If we actually do have a master going into replication on April 4,"
"00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,824","you know, that works for us."
"00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,826",-Okay. -But there's no-- I mean there's absolutely
"00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:04,795",no buffer in there anymore.
"00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,264","Rice: That's what we figured, but that sounds great."
"00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:10,000","I mean, I think the team's gonna be excited about that for sure."
"00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,704","Bailey: And having you guys in here as well, you know, this could be probably the biggest launch"
"00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,706",I think Double Fine's ever done.
"00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:17,875",Nordic Rep: Very good. Bailey: Yeah.
"00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:18,809",Exciting time.
"00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,878",Rice: So April 28th.
"00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:22,513","Hansen: Yep, April 28th."
"00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:23,881",Bailey: Awesome. Nordic Rep: All right.
"00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:28,252","Hansen: Yeah, yeah, it's-- we would-- basically it would be pencils down on the 27th."
"00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,754",Rice: Cool. Hansen: And then we'd just-- it just cooks in QA after that.
"00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,223",Rice: Right. Hansen: That should be really good.
"00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:35,826",We'll have a really solid build at that point.
"00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:38,095","Rice: Cool. I mean, it seems like best case scenario."
"00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:41,098",I didn't think they were gonna be so easy to move.
"00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,700","It's 'cause they had that buffer, waiting."
"00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,301",Bailey: I think the camera helped.
"00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,136",The camera probably did help.
"00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:48,806","Bailey: Thanks, 2 Player! Hansen: Yeah."
"00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:50,507",Schafer: Okay.
"00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:53,444",So I heard that I could add a character.
"00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,546","Yeah, okay. No, that's awesome."
"00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:57,881",Hansen: Maybe....two characters? Schafer: That's really good news.
"00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:04,555",I did not want to go into this knowing that we'd have to ship depending on a day one patch for basic stability.
"00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:06,991",So that's much better. That's awesome. Thank you.
"00:52:06,991 --> 00:52:11,795",Hansen: So this week's really important. So we need to make sure the team remains focused and we are reviewing the bugs constantly.
"00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,797",Rice: Sweet.
"00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,766","Cool, and Nordic's gonna be putting testers on it, too,"
"00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:17,434",looking at German.
"00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:19,269","Perfect. Coull: So, um, yeah."
"00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,271",Rice: Awesome. Sounds good.
"00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:23,440","Almost there, man. Almost there."
"00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:26,777",-I know.
"00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,416",Hopefully everyone will make one more week...
"00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:33,617","-...and we'll be, uh... -All right."
"00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:36,754",She's in. She's in right now.
"00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:37,788","Yeah, she just got here."
"00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:38,789",We should go talk to her.
"00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,026",Hi Anna. Kipnis: Hi.
"00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:43,260",Rice: Are you feeling better?
"00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,628",Kipnis: A little bit.
"00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:47,364","Rice: But they could turn around in three weeks they said, so --"
"00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:50,434","If it got to where we had to move it to the third, we probably could."
"00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:52,569",Yeah.
"00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:54,605",Kipnis: Well...
"00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:56,106","Rice: Well, I'm glad you're feeling better."
"00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:57,141",Kipnis: Yeah.
"00:52:57,141 --> 00:53:00,177",That was the worst week to have missed of work.
"00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,646","I mean, of all the times to get sick."
"00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:06,884","I would get emails every once in a while where I was like, fuck."
"00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:11,789","Well, I felt like I was letting the team down, but that the game wasn't gonna go in the toilet"
"00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:14,258",or anything while I was out so...
"00:53:14,258 --> 00:53:17,194","Yeah, I mean, it's nice to really trust your colleagues."
"00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:21,265","That's a good feeling that they actually, like, took the time to do it and stuff."
"00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:24,835","That's, I don't know, that's great, too, so."
"00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:30,340","Hey, I'm still not a hundred percent right now, but, um, I--I feel confident"
"00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:35,846","that we'll-- you know, we'll make it, especially with the little bit of extra time that we got."
"00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:38,048",Rice: Sounds good.
"00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,283",Crook: Okay. Rice: Good plan.
"00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:50,060","Boop, boop, boop."
"00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:55,065",Yay!
"00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:39,143","[Music] Crook: Yeah. Yeah, I'm just excited to be done, uh, soon."
"00:54:39,143 --> 00:54:41,345",Three years.
"00:54:41,345 --> 00:54:42,746","Kipnis: Yeah, it, uh, it's great."
"00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,481",It feels weird.
"00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,416",It feels weird that it's almost done.
"00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,885",It's the strangest thing.
"00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:49,419","Franzke: Yeah, it is kind of weird."
"00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:53,624","It's kind of weird to-- Well, it's kind of weird that it took three years."
"00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:57,394",I don't think--I don't think we kind of thought in the beginning it would take that long.
"00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:31,628","[Music] Schafer: Well, you know, three years is not that long for a game."
"00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,798","People will laugh at that, but Brutal was four years."
"00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:38,435",Grim-- I mean Psychonauts was five years.
"00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:45,442","Grim was three years, so it's the same amount of time as Grim with a smaller team and less crunch mode."
"00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:49,613","Grim was really, like, six years if you count all the evenings that we worked."
"00:55:49,613 --> 00:55:55,752","Um, but it's weird--it's weird to look at the old episodes and just think about how long we've been working on this"
"00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,788",and how different it felt in the beginning.
"00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:11,868","[Music] Look, Broken Age alumni."
"00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,538",We're wrapping it up. We're remembering the old people like Levi.
"00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:15,706","Ryken: Hi, everybody."
"00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,541",Rice: We miss you.
"00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:21,879","Schafer: Hello, everybody. Can you remind us, Greg, where we are, what's the schedule, and what will be happening now?"
"00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:26,550","Rice: So the next thing is locking down the build, which is happening at the end of the week."
"00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:34,858","Franzke: So really, it's not actually all that super glamorous, but essentially what you can see is all these files here"
"00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:37,661",that have the exclamation mark on it.
"00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:45,669",And what that means is that these files are different from the version of the file that's already in that branch.
"00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:51,074",So that's the release candidate branch and so I just say accept this and it will say okay.
"00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,878",That means I will overwrite all your files that you have right now
"00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:57,848",and then just let Perforce do its thing.
"00:56:57,848 --> 00:57:03,720","Have the little guy walking, which is still my favorite-- one of my favorite icons in terms of tools."
"00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:11,194","This is really a lot of programming, and especially release engineering"
"00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:18,802","is just sitting around waiting for files to be copied and for certain operations to be performed on files,"
"00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:22,406","which is just kind of weird, like one would expect that, you know, shipping a game is, like,"
"00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:24,808",super exciting kind of stuff.
"00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:28,278","But really, in the end of a day, it's a lot of copying files from A to B"
"00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:32,015",and sitting around waiting for those files to be copied.
"00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:38,822","Um, all right. So now we essentially have, like, all the yellow exclamation marks are gone,"
"00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:43,727","which means we now have a list of files, all the files that were changed."
"00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:47,597","And I'm just gonna say, okay, I want to commit these into the release kind of branch,"
"00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:51,134",so I'm gonna say integration from main.
"00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:55,505","And this is actually also lock down, so I'm gonna say content lock."
"00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:58,075","Oh, I actually have to spell it correctly."
"00:57:58,075 --> 00:58:02,679","And then I say submit, and that's essentially it."
"00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:09,219","So now we grab all the files from the main line and copy them over into the release candidate branch,"
"00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,788",and we lock down the build.
"00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:16,059","Rice: Right now all the, uh, disc stuff is basically off to Nordic and on their plate,"
"00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,195",so that should actually go into manufacturing this week.
"00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:20,831",And they said they said they're gonna talk with us for photos
"00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,866",and gonna update as they go along.
"00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:27,771",But this should be tracking towards same day launching the disc as the game digitally.
"00:58:27,771 --> 00:58:30,173","Schafer: I know what you're saying, why are you wearing luau clothes, Tim?"
"00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:33,510","-Yeah. Rice: Why are you wearing-- -No, it's pretty normal."
"00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:40,517",Schafer: I am wearing both pants and luau pants because tonight we are going to have a bonfire down at the beach
"00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,286","to celebrate the completion of Broken Age, everybody."
"00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:46,857",[Applause] Yay!
"00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:49,826","He's like, son of a-- about fucking time!"
"00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,495","Yes, okay."
"00:58:51,495 --> 00:58:53,330","It's just about done, right, Oliver?"
"00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,031",No way it could ever bounce out of cert now?
"00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,100",You only have time to eat now during meetings.
"00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,838",Yeah! Yes!
"00:59:02,440 --> 01:00:14,620",[Music]
