"00:00:25,347 --> 00:00:29,341","Cameraman: How are we going to continue making this documentary without spoiling anything?"
"00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:31,249","Schafer: I don't know."
"00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:36,089","People know now if they've, hopefully they're not watching this episode before they finish Act One."
"00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:39,143","You really shouldn't watch this episode."
"00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,379","Should we you shoot that now?"
"00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:43,248","Hi. I'm Tim Schafer."
"00:00:43,248 --> 00:00:46,808","Please don't watch this episode until you finish Act One of Broken Age."
"00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:53,663","Offscreen Voice: Backers that play it, or are you more nervous about the money,"
"00:00:53,663 --> 00:00:55,380","like how much it's going to sell?"
"00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:02,323","Schafer: No. I mean, I feel like it's tense about the money because we want it to do well, because I have big plans for Act Two."
"00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:07,457","And if we don't do well, Justin will be like, look, look, we can't, we got to, you know."
"00:01:07,457 --> 00:01:11,916","Because basically, just spending our own money from here on out."
"00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,499","And probably like a few months back."
"00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:20,212","So if no one buys the game tomorrow, maybe Act Two will be a much smaller than Act One."
"00:01:22,322 --> 00:01:25,409","I hope one person buys it."
"00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,800","If no one buys it, it's going to be really awkward."
"00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,847","But I guess that's a good clear, I can say that to the backers."
"00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:33,282","Look, nobody bought it, except for you guys."
"00:01:33,282 --> 00:01:34,722","I'm sorry."
"00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,941","But it serves me right for investing our own money in a game."
"00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:40,801","I should have just played with their money."
"00:01:42,664 --> 00:02:10,928","[Music] Schafer: We are launching Red's tomorrow."
"00:02:10,928 --> 00:02:14,182","Crazy times."
"00:02:14,182 --> 00:02:16,802","All of our backers."
"00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:21,044","Thank you to our team for working so hard."
"00:02:21,044 --> 00:02:30,000","We are going to the backers tomorrow and the rest of the general population, future backers, if you will on the 28th."
"00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,751","Rice: The game is up."
"00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,002","Preorders are up."
"00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:35,156","Schafer: Whoohoo! Rice: Yeah."
"00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,873","Schafer: All right, next game."
"00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:38,773","Rice: I will send the press release."
"00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:49,699","One of the reviewers said he didn't go to bed."
"00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:51,047","Finished the game last night."
"00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:52,040","Remo: Finished it last night?"
"00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,309","Rice: Yeah. Remo: Wow."
"00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:55,628","Rice: Yeah, I sent the codes at like..."
"00:02:55,628 --> 00:02:57,237","Remo: Did he say how long it took him?"
"00:02:57,237 --> 00:02:58,613","Rice: 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. Remo: Oh, right."
"00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:00,222","Rice: So I mean, I guess there's time."
"00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,469","But yeah, he just didn't stop."
"00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:03,309","That's kind of awesome."
"00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:05,947","Schafer: Man, this is weird."
"00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:07,187","People are playing Broken Age."
"00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,910","Seven people watching him and I'm one of them."
"00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:17,465","I don't want them to know this is what I do."
"00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:18,469","I've never done this before."
"00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:23,692","We've never been able to do this before and have live streams, like after Grim Fandango."
"00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:30,159","Remo: People are already posting screenshots."
"00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,314","Bailey: I'm still waiting."
"00:03:31,314 --> 00:03:34,470","I'm just curious who's going to be the first one to like post a review."
"00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,682","Remo: Yeah, right."
"00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,349","Rice: Tim, did you hear that? Schafer: What?"
"00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:46,864","Rice: Digital Trends posted an article, ""Why We're Breaking the Broken Age Embargo."" And how they're going to review it."
"00:03:46,864 --> 00:03:49,142","Schafer: Well, what embargo are they breaking?"
"00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:49,933","Rice: The review embargo."
"00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:52,123","They're going to put a review up."
"00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:53,525","Schafer: They're just announcing they're going to break it?"
"00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,761","Rice: Yeah. Schafer: Why?"
"00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:58,666","Rice: Because they paid for the game and they're a backer."
"00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:02,784","And they're getting it because they paid for it."
"00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:06,267","Schafer: But we, but they're not, they're in the Beta..."
"00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:08,488","Rice: They haven't reviewed it yet, but Digital Trends, I know."
"00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:10,748","They emailed me about this yesterday and that's what I told them."
"00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:14,453","Remo: Technically no one signed anything so there's nothing we can actually do about it now. Rice: Yeah."
"00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:16,046","Schafer: What do you think about that? Bailey: I'm sorry?"
"00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:17,637","Rice: Yeah, I don't think there's anything we can about it."
"00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:18,743","Bailey: Well, unless we have something in writing."
"00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:21,375","Remo: No, we don't. Embargoes are not really enforceable."
"00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,451","Bailey: Exactly. It's a professional..."
"00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:24,738","Remo: I know, I know. It's a courtesy."
"00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:26,324","A professional courtesy, yeah."
"00:04:26,324 --> 00:04:29,565","Schafer: Well, maybe he didn't agree to anything but he knows he's being a shit."
"00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:32,373","Schafer: It's like people don't realize that everything's embargo."
"00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:38,223","Like every review they read has usually been embargoed, because your game's coming out and people want the press for the game"
"00:04:38,223 --> 00:04:41,706","to come up on launch day or around that time people can buy it."
"00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:45,944","'Cause if it comes out before, then all that energy, people see that article, they can't go buy it."
"00:04:45,944 --> 00:04:46,837","So anyway."
"00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:52,697","You want your, you want to time your press to that day, but different reporters can come in at different times"
"00:04:52,697 --> 00:04:57,213","and they're like hey, I want to, you know, just because this guy came in a week early,"
"00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,515","does that mean his review gets to go up a week earlier?"
"00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:05,252","So you say it's embargoed, so that all the press has a fair chance of getting their story, not getting scooped or whatever."
"00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:10,191","And they also have time with the build to do a thoughtful build instead of racing to like getting it out early."
"00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:15,874","But we were going out to backers and 90,000 people had the build and I think most of the regular backers were like,"
"00:05:15,874 --> 00:05:17,330","OK, yeah, this is private information."
"00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,963","I won't spoil it for people who can't buy it yet."
"00:05:19,963 --> 00:05:21,990","And the press understood it."
"00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:28,983","But there's kind of this grey area of people between backers and press, like a, kind of like a blogger, you know, who's a backer,"
"00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:30,964","who's like, hey, I paid money for this."
"00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:36,677","This guy's amazed to see consumers suggest the press should stick their heads in the sand because Double Fine asked them to nicely."
"00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:39,999","For the evening crowd, the Broken Age embargo's a bit of a joke."
"00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:44,495","Has anyone else contacted you from actual news outlet? Rice: IGN."
"00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:46,553","Schafer: Do they want to review it or just, what'd they say?"
"00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:47,647","Rice: Yeah, it was just yesterday."
"00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,981","It's like I just want to be clear on what's expected."
"00:05:49,981 --> 00:05:53,856","He says like I feel like there's so many people that are going to be having the game."
"00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:58,535","Like if other people start running their reviews, we're going to feel like we're going to have to run ours."
"00:05:58,535 --> 00:06:00,075","That's basically what they said."
"00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,804","Schafer: Why don't we just let the people who are not being jerks about it break the embargo?"
"00:06:07,804 --> 00:06:08,829","Rice: We can't do that."
"00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:12,127","Schafer: And that would scoop all the people who are being jerks about it."
"00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:14,763","Why, we can't do that?"
"00:06:14,763 --> 00:06:17,674","Rice: I don't know how to enforce that."
"00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:21,544","Schafer: Just pick the ones that are being nice about it and just tell them they can."
"00:06:21,544 --> 00:06:24,986","Then one day later tell everyone else."
"00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:31,815","Rice: Yeah. I think that only serves to inflate the issue, because then they think the embargo is still there"
"00:06:31,815 --> 00:06:34,906","and then it's being broken and then it's a mess."
"00:06:34,906 --> 00:06:37,972","So I think we have to, Schafer: It's kind of a mess, though, I think now."
"00:06:37,972 --> 00:06:42,272","Rice: Well, then, that's the case and I think we have to talk about lifting it."
"00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:49,523","And then I'm fine like, I've been saving the list of people I've emailed all the review stuff"
"00:06:49,523 --> 00:06:56,443","so it would really be like a two second Kickstarter update and emailing them all, if you want to just totally lift things."
"00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:02,635","Schafer: Maybe we could just open it in a couple days, kind of."
"00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:04,052","Rice: Just sit on it for a second and see."
"00:07:04,052 --> 00:07:06,161","Schafer: Yeah. Rice: OK."
"00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:08,528","Schafer: God, that embargo's a disaster."
"00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:15,534","Schafer: And so because like one or two people were threatening to like break it, that all of a sudden made everybody else who wasn't breaking it like a chump."
"00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:18,725","And I didn't want them, you know, to feel, so we just like, look, OK."
"00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:21,147","We take back our request that no one's, go ahead."
"00:07:21,147 --> 00:07:22,716","Post all the reviews and stuff."
"00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:26,153","So a bunch of our reviews went up when people couldn't buy the game."
"00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:31,208","So that was kind, it took away a lot of our, like our press hit for the launch day, which is too bad."
"00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:34,760","But it seemed like it was, it would, we just couldn't, it was out of control."
"00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:41,862","There was just like 90,000 people, even if like 80,000 of them are totally like, yeah, it's cool."
"00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,637","But if like just a few took one or two breaks, then the whole thing just falls apart."
"00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:50,998","Schafer: All our backers are so cool, but the backers who are in the press feel a little differently."
"00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:52,878","They feel they have the option to not be cool."
"00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,393","It's an awkward situation."
"00:07:56,393 --> 00:08:00,653","Next time we wouldn't, I think actually have private forums for that reason."
"00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:07,713","Schafer: I mean, I feel in end that I just don't, I just don't want to have this fight any more about private stuff and all."
"00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:14,228","It just puts, I mean, being in this antagonist relationship with the press is just not comfortable,"
"00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:18,740","'cause you need them and they're usually really good friends of ours."
"00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:24,944","I'm just getting mad at them one by one for breaking the faith of the backer agreement."
"00:08:25,926 --> 00:08:27,707","It's annoying."
"00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:33,110","Bailey: You know, one third of our, of all the articles that were written about Broken Age were about the embargo."
"00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,077","And then another third were about us going from early access changing it to a regular release."
"00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:43,697","And then one third were about the game. Yeah. So."
"00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:50,926","Rice: If we're saying backer Beta's the 14th and public release is the 28th, that would give the press builds like the 12th or something."
"00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:57,932","And embargo them, Bailey: This is an interesting one, because I think this is the next one that could lead to a PR blowup."
"00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:01,852","Bailey: Yeah. I was not in favor of the embargo."
"00:09:01,852 --> 00:09:03,824","Rice: But preorders are there like you said."
"00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:06,944","So people can still at least go and get the preorder."
"00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:13,188","Bailey: So the preorders are, they're less than we expected."
"00:09:13,188 --> 00:09:17,431","They are, we were hoping that they'd come in higher."
"00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:27,959","If I had to project off the preorders we received so far, that would be a kind of bleak outlook as far as how many we'd actually sell,"
"00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,040","you know, for the lifetime of Broken Age."
"00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:39,328","But I'm basing everything off if different historicals for other games that Tim has sold and none of those have had this kind of Kickstarter story."
"00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,748","So this is definitely unique."
"00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:49,445","I don't think it's time for us to panic right now, but it puts a whole lot more emphasis and importance on January 28th"
"00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:50,887","when it comes out for real."
"00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:55,007","'Cause I think it will do well in the long-run, but it's like how long is that run."
"00:09:57,102 --> 00:10:04,209","The other piece that I think is kind of silver-lining in all this is the reviews are coming in really good."
"00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:09,677","You know, I foresee that the game's going to have a great word-of-mouth buzz."
"00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:11,531","Most of Tim's games actually do."
"00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:14,510","And they have a, it has a very long tail."
"00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:20,900","There're games, what people call ""evergreen games"", they keep on selling at a certain, certain level and they just keep on,"
"00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,586","which keeps on accumulating over the years, which is different than most games."
"00:10:25,586 --> 00:10:28,825","Most games have that huge spike, that hump, that six-weeks hump."
"00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:30,875","Tim's are different."
"00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:38,067","So that's one good thing to take into account with all the good reviews and all the social media and the good word of mouth we're having."
"00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:41,183","You know, it's like we can't get to a place where we could sell this game quick enough,"
"00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:47,472","because that's where we're really going to be able to see and project, you know, what the success of the game's going to be."
"00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:51,808","Rice: So the other thing Tim was talking about is just that now that we have to move the embargo up and reviews are out now,"
"00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:56,916","the idea of flipping the switch on Steam earlier."
"00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,672","Schafer: Releasing it a, a week earlier."
"00:10:58,672 --> 00:10:59,770","Like next Tuesday."
"00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:03,283","Schafer: Sure, whatever."
"00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:07,007","and like, you know, Schafer: Well, that's the question."
"00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:10,728","I mean, and there's, I mean there's a legitimate business reason, I think about it just because it's out there,"
"00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:14,503","it's getting a lot of attention right now and there's a lot of press I'm going to do in the next week."
"00:11:14,503 --> 00:11:20,977","And it'd be nice if people, I mean can go pre-purchase it, but they can't buy it."
"00:11:20,977 --> 00:11:25,270","Rice: It'd be nice to have a story about the game being pushed forward."
"00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,980","Franzke: I voiced my concern about this plan."
"00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:34,957","I mean technically it does make like, like just looking at how the long the things take, just doesn't really make all that much sense."
"00:11:34,957 --> 00:11:36,643","Franzke: And you know, I explained like that."
"00:11:36,643 --> 00:11:43,198","That we can certainly do it but it will be very unadvisable, especially considering that time when that was first proposed."
"00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:46,757","We still had big problems with crashes and people not being able to play the game at all."
"00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:54,311","So that was my main worry, that you know, we were still like trying to find the really big issues and so."
"00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:57,477","So we didn't feel like it was ready to ship it then."
"00:11:57,477 --> 00:12:04,773","But I think now, basically I don't think anything will have changed if we final release it on the planned day we had initially,"
"00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:09,384","just because technically time-wise it doesn't really work out any other way, anyways."
"00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,388","Schafer: But it's good."
"00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:16,160","So now the official reviews, now they are rolling in."
"00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,024","The great thing is that they're all really great."
"00:12:18,024 --> 00:12:21,484","I mean, that Polygon one was nine out of ten, which is great."
"00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:25,407","I mean, I would give it a ten, but I'll accept a nine."
"00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:31,422","Polygon Review: Broken Age may be unfinished, but it's also delightful, beautiful, utterly charming"
"00:12:31,422 --> 00:12:35,690","and you really should play it right this second."
"00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,537","Stapley: No, it's cool."
"00:12:36,537 --> 00:12:40,587","It's awesome that it sounded like, that we all made an awesome thing now."
"00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:42,526","Like this is the cool part, you know."
"00:12:42,526 --> 00:12:48,226","Like we made this awesome thing and now it's out in the world for everybody to look at."
"00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:52,510","Rice: Yeah, I guess. Stapley: OK. How many reviews are there now."
"00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,416","Crook: But it feels good."
"00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:57,166","And people seem to be really responding to the game."
"00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,591","The reviews have been really good."
"00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:05,778","And even comments about animation, which you don't get that often."
"00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:08,810","It seems like in games a lot of times, maybe you will a couple of times."
"00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:14,903","But there's been several other reviews that have mentioned the animation, that they really, that they really liked it."
"00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:17,146","And that's, that's rewarding."
"00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:18,741","Oh, yeah. Yeah."
"00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:20,358","I saw a nine today; that's nice."
"00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:27,272","But you know, I actually, I feel kind of bad I don't really, I try not to read a lot of the reviews"
"00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:30,565","because the bad ones do kind of make me, put me down."
"00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:34,271","You know, they kind of, you know, when you're kind of on this high that you've released it"
"00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:40,717","and then suddenly, even though if there's like six good reviews and one bad one, that bad one kind of affects me."
"00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:46,405","So I try not to read a lot of the comments until a little bit later on."
"00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:48,939","Heatseeker Review: Broken Age gets by on the strength of its storytelling."
"00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:56,603","The puzzles aren't particularly complex or compelling with the exception of a certain vomiting tree."
"00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:59,997","And serve as a reason to explore the environments."
"00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:05,243","I can't say I recommend this to people who don't already have a fondness for this genre."
"00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:13,066","Compared to modern entries in the genre like those from Telltale Games, it may seem a little simple or even boring."
"00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:16,704","Schafer: This is actually just new posts, for new posts today."
"00:14:16,704 --> 00:14:18,925","Oh God. The guy wants a refund."
"00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:22,162","It's like, ah. This is a jerk."
"00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,004","I'm just going to say it."
"00:14:23,004 --> 00:14:24,270","This is a jerk."
"00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,514","Thanks for backing, jerk."
"00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:32,427","Franzke: You know, it's unrealistic to expect that people will be able to please everybody, obviously."
"00:14:32,427 --> 00:14:39,120","Unfortunately very often the people who are the most dissatisfied are also the loudest ones, you know, which can be difficult,"
"00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,394","especially if you're pouring a lot of effort and a lot of work and a lot of your like, like ""soul's"" the wrong word,"
"00:14:44,394 --> 00:14:47,604","but like a lot of your personal kind of effort into the game."
"00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:51,099","Like to see somebody come in and like just completely smash it."
"00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,416","I did the mistake and I should know better after so many years in games."
"00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:59,367","I think I went in Kotaku where they had an article about the ""Retro Mode""."
"00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:02,348","And like one of the comments, and you should never do that if you work in games."
"00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:03,331","Never read the comments."
"00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:05,580","Actually, generally don't read any internet comments."
"00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,749","I scroll down and somebody was like, this just look shit."
"00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:14,594","Like this is, you know, here, here's a comparison to a hand painted, hand painted sprites, versus down-res"
"00:15:14,594 --> 00:15:15,547","It's like, yes, obviously."
"00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:23,135","And then backers immediately jumped in ""Well they just put it in as a little add on"" Still the person was not satisfied with that at all."
"00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:27,999","And then he's like, well, if you were a backer you would see that, you know, they just put in during the weekend as a little side project."
"00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,356","I'm not a backer but this is shit."
"00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:30,496","I'm not going to buy this."
"00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,105","It gets, [throws hands up, exasperated]."
"00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,400","Having said all that, overall I think people are very happy."
"00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,711","I've got a lot of Tweets from people who are super happy with the project."
"00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:40,673","On the forums people are very happy, you know."
"00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:44,327","We saw someplace where some people like really, really enjoying the game."
"00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:50,950","And like, you know, it's good to see super-positive reactions of somebody just like laughing about all the jokes in the game."
"00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,290","And just generally like finding the game very beautiful and stuff like that."
"00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,110","So it's good."
"00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,240","Web Streamer: Fuck yeah!"
"00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720","Web Streamer: I don't know! Which one! What do I pick!"
"00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,160","Oohh."
"00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,300","Shay: This must be where Marek sleeps."
"00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,685","Web Streamer: So he keeps the costume on while he sleeps."
"00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:15,457","That's funny."
"00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,360","Man, this is a genius game, genius story."
"00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:28,194","Schafer: I'm super happy that no one seems to have guessed the big spoiler at the end of it."
"00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:29,814","I really thought that was going to get out."
"00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,120","And actually long ago on the forums, one guy guessed it."
"00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:36,397","And no one followed up on it."
"00:16:36,397 --> 00:16:40,006","Like no one, he just said his little thing, hey, what if this is the case?"
"00:16:40,006 --> 00:16:41,584","And no one answered him."
"00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,178","I was like, oh man."
"00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:45,109","I feel, oh God."
"00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:49,759","You know, I hate that guy for guessing it, but I'm really, it's worth something."
"00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,459","We should send him some chocolate."
"00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:58,107","But everyone else has just had the exact like experience that I was hoping for, which is that they were really like, oh my God!"
"00:16:58,107 --> 00:16:59,487","I didn't see that coming, that's crazy."
"00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,537","Web Streamer: It's Shay!"
"00:17:02,677 --> 00:17:04,777","Shay was controlling Mog Chothra."
"00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,970","Web Streamer: Uhhh, Shay?"
"00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:15,625","Web Streamer: What the heck?"
"00:17:19,058 --> 00:17:19,898","What the heck?"
"00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,868","That's Shay!"
"00:17:25,848 --> 00:17:28,512","Schafer: But they all seemed to really be enjoying the ending."
"00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:30,580","And so I'm really happy with that."
"00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:36,288","And I'm really happy with people's response to like the story, the characters."
"00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:46,884","And a lot of people, I think, will actually appreciate the difficulty level in the game once we get out of the most hardcore part of the audience."
"00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:55,302","I think they'll like that, that it flows more as opposed to hitting a series of really, really hard stops, for most people."
"00:17:59,275 --> 00:18:01,332","Schafer: I mean, you can tell they already anticipated that."
"00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:09,893","After play-testing the first part, I was like, I think this is a little easy, but I think rather than just throwing a monkey wrench, Monkey Island joke,"
"00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:20,357","in there, I'm really focusing on Act Two and making Act Two a little more, instead of things being one step, having them be a little more complex."
"00:18:21,411 --> 00:18:23,631","So I'm way ahead of them, way ahead of them on that."
"00:18:25,274 --> 00:18:27,363","Petty: You know, I think, yeah, it's interesting."
"00:18:27,363 --> 00:18:33,320","Like the, I don't, I don't think I read anything that I felt was unfair and it all seemed pretty balanced."
"00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:39,653","There were, I think, you know, there's some comments about length, maybe a couple of them."
"00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:43,787","And that's kind of difficult, because you know, I mean, this was the same on Stacking."
"00:18:43,787 --> 00:18:50,492","You know, you can, you can burn through an adventure game and, and that can really shorten your play experience."
"00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:54,503","But I don't know if that's the best way to evaluate that particular game."
"00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:58,263","You know, it's not a game that has a mechanic that just like is endlessly playable."
"00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:04,363","So it's a little, I don't know, you know, it's just, it's just something that happens with adventure games that, I've seen that come up."
"00:19:04,363 --> 00:19:09,602","I don't necessarily disagree with it, but I guess I don't know what to say about it, you know."
"00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:15,905","But I think, you know, in some other stuff is stuff that we discussed early on that I've seen like, you know, the lack of a verb coin or a verb page."
"00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:20,529","And I think that's just a choice Tim, and I think the correct choice Tim made early on, you know."
"00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:27,152","I don't think there's probably people played Machinarium that also was like, this would be better if I could have a look and examine and verb link."
"00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:31,292","But I don't really feel like the experience needed it in any way and I don't really feel like Broken Age needs it in anyway."
"00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:35,574","And I don't really feel like that's where we puzzle depth, mechanical depth anyways."
"00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:42,485","So you know, I mean, I wouldn't oppose it if someone really, really, like we had started the game and we really, really wanted to take that approach."
"00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:49,919","But I just like the idea of you know, I think Tim's initial vision for the game would be like, well, what if adventure games just kept going?"
"00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,512","And we just were keeping it working."
"00:19:51,512 --> 00:19:53,587","We wouldn't keep making the exact same thing."
"00:19:53,587 --> 00:19:57,883","We'd try and mess with the formula and advance things and I think that's what we tried to do with visuals."
"00:19:57,883 --> 00:19:59,987","We didn't want to make retro visuals, right."
"00:19:59,987 --> 00:20:07,227","We wanted to make visuals that were 2D and charming, but also took advantage of modern methodologies and technologies and resolutions."
"00:20:07,227 --> 00:20:11,067","And I think the approach to the game play is consistent with that."
"00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:13,613","And this is a choice."
"00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:21,294","You know, and some people will want that exact Monkey Island moment and some people are like, thank God, the puzzles aren't that confusing, you know."
"00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:23,709","It's hard, it's hard to get the right."
"00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:31,877","Petty: So what I would like to do is next week, since Bagel's out for two weeks and I wanted him to come out at this time so we could kick off Act Two."
"00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:35,646","So I would like to kind of, at the very least, we'll see who has time."
"00:20:35,646 --> 00:20:41,650","At the very least Bagel and Levi and myself to start concept jamming next week on early Act Two stuff."
"00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:46,701","And Tim hasn't delivered the final design or dialogue yet, but I already know some of high level stuff"
"00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:51,660","and then hopefully we can get him to kind of, I can kind of like mention all that and he can kind of correct me"
"00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,528","where he's changed things and just get us going."
"00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:59,948","So there's definitely a new, at least one new area that has no presence at all in the current act that we have to design."
"00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:04,638","And we had some very early stuff on it from before, but we haven't thought about it in 18 months."
"00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,042","So we'll probably start there."
"00:21:07,042 --> 00:21:10,946","Stapley: So are these the only new, this is like pretty much all we have to worry, really worry about, right?"
"00:21:10,946 --> 00:21:12,860","I mean, those only new things?"
"00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,742","Petty: Well, this is the new stuff we know about for sure."
"00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:17,582","So I thought we'd start there. OK."
"00:21:17,582 --> 00:21:21,912","So the thing that Tim, like he's going to be here after lunch, we can him some more questions"
"00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:27,374","but the thing that we know for sure is that we need a monster lands area."
"00:21:27,374 --> 00:21:33,096","It's probably also a good chance for us to think about where we want to go with, you know, as we're developing him,"
"00:21:33,096 --> 00:21:35,472","if we want to go anyplace different with Marek."
"00:21:35,472 --> 00:21:37,065","Here's another concept that we can think about."
"00:21:37,065 --> 00:21:40,497","Is we talked about, OK, what Alex's is."
"00:21:40,497 --> 00:21:44,516","And originally Tim kept saying, well, it's, oh, this'll be a copy of Mog Chothra to save time."
"00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:46,606","And I was saying, well, that's not really going to save us much time."
"00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:50,662","I mean, it'll save a week or so of production time, but..."
"00:21:50,662 --> 00:21:52,362","Stapley: It's got to be like older version."
"00:21:52,362 --> 00:21:53,426","Petty: Right. Like it's been buried."
"00:21:53,426 --> 00:21:55,233","It's not going to look the same."
"00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:57,180","I'd love to see it like a previous generation."
"00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,916","Because when we were starting to draw like, I don't know, maybe, like some of these older ones or whatever,"
"00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:05,187","like remember we had all those ideas like, oh, it's got diamond-shape eyes instead of hex eyes."
"00:22:05,187 --> 00:22:08,361","Ryken: Yeah, just like changes with times."
"00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:12,360","400 years, like, oh yeah, but then he came around to hexes again."
"00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,121","And then it went away for another 100 years."
"00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:15,504","Petty: We added two sides to our windows."
"00:22:15,504 --> 00:22:16,707","Stapley: That's awesome. That's always the best."
"00:22:16,707 --> 00:22:21,650","Like in Star Wars, you're like, well, that's R2D2, but it's a fucking red R2D2 and it's like different."
"00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,836","Awesome. I always love that."
"00:22:23,836 --> 00:22:27,773","Petty: Well plus it would be cool, too, like this one doesn't have, it's been buried for however long"
"00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:30,779","so it doesn't have to look as purely organic, you know."
"00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:34,011","Like we're not, we're no longer trying to make people believe it's just a monster."
"00:22:34,011 --> 00:22:38,479","So being able to see some combination of the mechanical and the monster..."
"00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:42,474","Ryken: Yeah, like the outer hull is just like ripped away and most of the parts."
"00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:45,859","Stapley: But it'll still be the same like rig kind of set up, right?"
"00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:48,155","Petty: I mean, it could be whatever we want."
"00:22:48,155 --> 00:22:49,790","Bog Chothra."
"00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,121","Stapley: Bog Chothra?"
"00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,147","Bog, I like that one."
"00:22:53,147 --> 00:22:54,464","I like Bog."
"00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,883","Ryken: Just Bob."
"00:22:55,883 --> 00:22:58,938","Stapley: Bob Chothra? Awesome."
"00:22:58,938 --> 00:23:00,338","That would be fucking sweet."
"00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:05,559","Stapley: All right. Should we call Scott and get pumped?"
"00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:12,593","Stapley: Yeah! Look, whoo!"
"00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:14,244","Hey, bro, get us pumped up!"
"00:23:14,244 --> 00:23:16,881","Get us pumped up!"
"00:23:16,881 --> 00:23:19,600","We're all like, boo, drawing is stupid."
"00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,827","He still in bed?"
"00:23:20,827 --> 00:23:22,276","Campbell: Chilling on the couch."
"00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:25,053","Stapley: Oh, man."
"00:23:25,053 --> 00:23:28,052","Campbell: I was just, I was just watching Triplets of Belleville."
"00:23:28,052 --> 00:23:30,055","Stapley: Oh, sweet, dude."
"00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:31,386","Campbell: What are you guys, what are you guys doing?"
"00:23:31,386 --> 00:23:32,479","Stapley: We're doing an art jam, dude."
"00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:37,321","We're doing an art jam and nobody's pumped up and like, like nobody fucking is as psyched as you."
"00:23:37,321 --> 00:23:38,981","You got to get us psyched."
"00:23:38,981 --> 00:23:43,226","You know, when you and Peter are here, you guys are like, ooh, ooh, ooh!"
"00:23:43,226 --> 00:23:45,040","So come on, bro, do it, go for it."
"00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,141","Ryken: We need some art cheerleading."
"00:23:46,141 --> 00:23:47,320","Campbell: Get psyched, man."
"00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,810","What are you guys working on? Tell me about it."
"00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,348","Stapley: All right, check it out. Rice: What are you doing?"
"00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:52,916","Stapley: Monster lands. Uh oh, look who it is."
"00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:57,000","What, tall man. Petty: Scott!"
"00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,471","Stapley: Yeah, we're all getting pumped. OK, cool."
"00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:04,702","This is one monster, man."
"00:24:04,702 --> 00:24:06,605","Schafer: Who are you talking to?"
"00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:08,489","Hi! Scott Campbell!"
"00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,068","Hi! Everybody's at the art jam."
"00:24:10,068 --> 00:24:15,447","Stapley: I'm excited to hear about what we're going to do, because, 'cause I know that we all like, this is like,"
"00:24:15,447 --> 00:24:19,602","not really trial and error but I got pretty much trial and error."
"00:24:19,602 --> 00:24:22,144","You get closer to the end, everything started working really smoothly."
"00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:28,614","So you know, it's going to be way better for sure, you know, 'cause we learned so much."
"00:24:28,614 --> 00:24:34,111","But I'm, I'm actually excited to see how we take all the things that we learned, trial and error-wise"
"00:24:34,111 --> 00:24:40,878","and try to get it, you know, see what happens with the next, how organized we are, what we learned."
"00:24:41,476 --> 00:24:43,764","Schafer: OK."
"00:24:43,764 --> 00:24:44,990","Stapley: Those are the new things."
"00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,720","Schafer: Monster lands and the gate Stapley: And there's only the pollution inside like the kingdom."
"00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:52,485","Schafer: Don't film his armpits."
"00:24:52,485 --> 00:24:54,625","Stapley: Oh God, are they like, oh God!"
"00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,265","Fuck. It's horrible."
"00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:00,772","Hey, bro."
"00:25:02,145 --> 00:25:04,385","Schafer: Aren't you glad you're not here right now?"
"00:25:04,385 --> 00:25:12,020","It would be nice to get the main characters some different outfits, just to make the game feel... Petty: So would she put on a space suit?"
"00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:18,146","Schafer: I see her with the radiation suit and I don't know necessarily if he, I can't think of, I haven't thought of a puzzle."
"00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:18,746","What?"
"00:25:18,746 --> 00:25:19,986","Stapley: He could be in a cake dress."
"00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,862","Petty: We should do a transgender thing where he starts dressing like a girl, 'cause he gets the maiden,"
"00:25:23,862 --> 00:25:26,898","leftover maiden's outfits and she dresses like a boy."
"00:25:27,198 --> 00:25:33,012","Schafer: I mean, he could put a druid cloak or he could, but he could put on a preener outfit."
"00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,180","remember we have those artworks, you had him masquerade as a preener for a while."
"00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,588","He could possibly have to do that."
"00:25:38,588 --> 00:25:41,288","I just think it would be more fun for the player to have them look really different."
"00:25:41,436 --> 00:25:43,264","Petty: He needs like a traveling cloak or something."
"00:25:43,264 --> 00:25:45,577","Piece it together. Yeah."
"00:25:46,320 --> 00:26:08,115","[Music] Franzke: Other than doing some concept artwork,"
"00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:14,553","nobody has to get started working on the second act anyways, so a lot of us are still working on bug fixes for this release."
"00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:18,366","And it's, you know, it's incremental update to the backer release."
"00:26:18,366 --> 00:26:23,674","So you know, I'm really optimistic that this is all like minor fixes to be put in."
"00:26:23,674 --> 00:26:27,435","But we're pretty solid, solid release."
"00:26:27,435 --> 00:26:36,293","Peck : We are investigating an issue with the track pad on Linux for laptops with track pads."
"00:26:36,293 --> 00:26:38,181","There's a little issue there."
"00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,255","A little oversensitive, you might say."
"00:26:40,255 --> 00:26:42,649","Franzke: You make a change and like, oh, it works on Windows and then you go into Linux."
"00:26:42,649 --> 00:26:44,834","Aaah! Gosh, it's broken."
"00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:46,115","What the hell is going on?"
"00:26:46,115 --> 00:26:52,020","Franzke: It was good to a have Beta release for sure, to kind of find a lot of issues and all the things we ran into,"
"00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,797","we were not unprepared for, but we didn't expect."
"00:26:54,797 --> 00:26:58,982","Like a lot of Window compatibility issue than we expected, for example."
"00:26:58,982 --> 00:27:02,978","And you know, that's why I have those guys here, like we had a lot of issues with compatibility,"
"00:27:02,978 --> 00:27:09,536","so we ordered a lot of graphics cards just to kind of, trying to reproduce some of the issues that users were running into."
"00:27:09,536 --> 00:27:11,565","Franzke: Oh, this is what compatibility is all about."
"00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:17,055","Finding really, really old hardware and putting in your machine and see what happens."
"00:27:17,055 --> 00:27:20,547","Franzke: You know, where here in the studio we didn't really have any problems running the game"
"00:27:20,547 --> 00:27:23,871","and like our external QA partner didn't have any problem running the game,"
"00:27:23,871 --> 00:27:30,951","but then as soon as we, you know, we launched it on, you know, on the day for the backers, like immediately people came back,"
"00:27:30,951 --> 00:27:34,438","oh, the game is crashing or sending out a black screen and stuff like that."
"00:27:34,438 --> 00:27:35,538","That's always like, crap."
"00:27:35,538 --> 00:27:40,276","If we would not have done it like that, we would have eventually run into this issues so you know,"
"00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:45,714","on the 28th we would have released the game and people would have had big problems with it and like,"
"00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:50,120","while crashes are not great, but at least acceptable during a Beta,"
"00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,060","like once the game is out there, you know, it becomes very less acceptable."
"00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,468","Franzke: This VGA out. Haven't seen that in a while."
"00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,947","I don't know if it's even still possible."
"00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:04,355","Franzke: I had, I think two crashes on Windows 98."
"00:28:04,355 --> 00:28:09,507","I mean, I was surprised that you managed to download Steam on that machine, I guess."
"00:28:09,507 --> 00:28:15,470","But yeah, unfortunately the game does not run on Windows 98 and I don't think it's part of the minimum requirement."
"00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,592","But yeah, that was, that was certainly very funny and surprising for sure."
"00:28:23,256 --> 00:28:25,539","Franzke: I knock on the graphics card right here."
"00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:33,607","Romero: And for right now we're in shooting crashes and blockers and people's progress is lost, saved and corrupted stuff like that."
"00:28:33,607 --> 00:28:39,135","I mean, for now it's like the forum is the bug list pretty much, 'cause there's so much coming in."
"00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:47,012","So before I was in, you know, I was looking through our bugs and now I'm looking through all these bugs."
"00:28:47,012 --> 00:28:48,127","Now they're the testers."
"00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:49,601","They're reporting the bugs to us."
"00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:54,562","We're merely the conduit through which, you know, we get the bugs to developer."
"00:28:54,562 --> 00:29:01,586","Lui: It's nice, I think, for the team to have an overview of how the overall progress is going."
"00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:08,286","So it's nice to be able to see, like look at the chart and be like, oh, we are constantly going down."
"00:29:08,286 --> 00:29:19,872","And there are spikes, like this spike over there is when Tim played through the game twice and submitted about fifteen pages of bug fixes."
"00:29:19,872 --> 00:29:22,466","Schafer: Should realize that it's gotta be done this week."
"00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:27,379","So if there's anything that I really care about getting fixed, I have to make a big stink about it right now."
"00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:31,735","But making big stinks is what I'm all about."
"00:29:31,735 --> 00:29:37,456","The camera's here and then when I click, ah, the camera moves."
"00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:40,377","So annoying."
"00:29:40,377 --> 00:29:44,696","Vella's first step makes camera twitch."
"00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:49,211","At the end of the game, there's just a million bugs with things flashing or twitching for one frame."
"00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:50,576","Drives me nuts."
"00:29:50,576 --> 00:29:54,735","When she gives him the cupcake, that's where the cupcake appears floating in midair for one frame."
"00:29:54,735 --> 00:29:59,374","Yep. The average player can't say what happened, but they'll just get this weird twitchy feeling"
"00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:03,990","when they're playing the game of like, aaah, something was just, it's like, just a feeling of it not being polished."
"00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,393","But I can see, like OK, that camera was wrong for one frame."
"00:30:07,393 --> 00:30:09,009","Sometimes I can't even tell if I saw a flash."
"00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:11,029","Like at the end of that cutscene, I swear I saw a flash."
"00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:14,181","I'm trying to fix everything."
"00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:16,149","You can't fix everything."
"00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,229","The mouse sensitivity is weird, though."
"00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:32,686","Peck: Myself, I've been, I got a couple of small little crashes in the UI, stuff like that, that I've been fixing."
"00:30:32,686 --> 00:30:36,034","And but yeah, mostly like, these are my bugs right now."
"00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:41,475","They all fit on one span of the window, so it's like, things are going well."
"00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:44,254","Schafer: How many bugs are left in Bugzilla?"
"00:30:44,254 --> 00:30:46,486","Is it really a sizeable amount still?"
"00:30:48,363 --> 00:30:51,588","Crook: Yeah. I mean these are all, they're all, they're, most of them are minor."
"00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:53,236","Schafer: Who's making all these bugs?"
"00:30:53,236 --> 00:30:57,344","Crook: I mean they're just minor but we know the game's coming out again, you know, as the final."
"00:30:57,344 --> 00:31:00,894","So, so we just want to make it as good as we can."
"00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:07,153","We're going to be, most of us will roll off on Monday, onto other things for a while."
"00:31:07,153 --> 00:31:08,124","And come back."
"00:31:08,124 --> 00:31:09,167","Schafer: OK, great."
"00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:18,493","Crook: We're going to have to assess at the end of the month, we got to figure out how much work is ready to just start doing."
"00:31:19,654 --> 00:31:24,352","Crook: Sorry. So yeah."
"00:31:24,352 --> 00:31:27,785","Which, you know, some of the script is written but there's still more to go."
"00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:33,785","So I'm not sure how much work there will be, just for the first, you know, couple weeks."
"00:31:33,785 --> 00:31:36,159","So we got to keep people busy, though."
"00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:41,359","We had three of our animators actually go off the project now, so they've moved onto other projects."
"00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,137","Roberts: I'm leaving Broken Age."
"00:31:43,137 --> 00:31:47,528","Because I'm moving onto another unannounced project."
"00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:57,205","And they'll be, the rest of the Broken Age team that's left on that project, they're going to continue on Broken Age Part Two."
"00:31:57,205 --> 00:32:06,887","So yeah, the nature of this new project is such that I don't see myself going over and helping out on Act Two at all."
"00:32:06,887 --> 00:32:11,725","But you know, that's famous last words, so it could happen."
"00:32:11,725 --> 00:32:17,348","I would love to, at least animate something, but we are getting pretty busy around here with other things"
"00:32:17,348 --> 00:32:23,410","so yeah, that, that I can't see happening."
"00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,844","Offscreen Voice: Was it nice while it lasted?"
"00:32:24,844 --> 00:32:26,257","Roberts: It was, yeah, yeah."
"00:32:26,257 --> 00:32:32,785","It was a nice, I wasn't really expecting to work on this project at all, so it was kind of a nice surprise."
"00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:35,920","And it was something that I wanted to work on."
"00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,752","Of course, you know, everyone here wanted to, well, most people here, I can't say everyone,"
"00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:44,477","but most people here wanted to, you know, at least put their hands on this because,"
"00:32:44,477 --> 00:32:52,589","just because it made history for you know, not to sound too grandiose about it, but that's what it did, right?"
"00:32:52,589 --> 00:32:55,332","I mean, there is history that was made here."
"00:32:55,332 --> 00:33:04,721","And so everyone that saw that, you know, thinks wow, yeah, that's something I at least want to put something in there."
"00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:12,447","So OK. Goodbye, Broken Age."
"00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:19,498","Goodbye 2HB. Goodbye, Maya."
"00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:23,148","Goodbye Double Fine."
"00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:29,653","Schafer: So we'll launch the game tomorrow and hopefully if we're not all here fixing bugs, we'll get to go out and have another,"
"00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:31,982","we'll go back to Red's, I hope."
"00:33:31,982 --> 00:33:33,994","If it's still standing."
"00:33:33,994 --> 00:33:35,829","And take the team out for drinks."
"00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:41,230","And before they all roll off, temporarily, onto other projects, I'd like to have them all hang out."
"00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,125","Go have a drink and celebrate."
"00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:49,622","'Cause it's weird, it's like, you wish these launches were super-clean, like everyone could just say, everything was great!"
"00:33:49,622 --> 00:33:53,864","So hopefully, I mean, time usually just washes away all the smaller things that happened,"
"00:33:53,864 --> 00:33:58,428","like that embargo thing and all that other stuff will be forgotten."
"00:33:58,428 --> 00:34:05,440","And people will just remember how we didn't have mouse sensitivity when we launched and now we do."
"00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,960","No, that won't be the thing. Maybe."
"00:34:09,835 --> 00:34:13,161","Rice: It's Elijah Wood's birthday today. Bailey: Oh wow."
"00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:16,020","Rice: So this is a good birthday present, right? Bailey: Yeah."
"00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:19,190","Rice: Tim, call Elijah and wish and wish him a happy birthday."
"00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,978","Schafer: Call him? Rice: Yeah, like you do with your mom."
"00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:25,118","Schafer: Hey, Elijah! Happy birthday. Oh, shoot."
"00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:31,458","[Phone rings] Bailey: Yeah. It's interesting, though."
"00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:34,336","You think about Tim, like he's been working on this game for two years."
"00:34:34,337 --> 00:34:39,829","It's now being commercially released but so much goes into, you know, the lead up to this."
"00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:40,949","And I guess I could understand."
"00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:47,525","It's a little anti-climactic when you sit here and you just kind of like refresh the webpage and look at numbers."
"00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:55,686","The interesting thing about price, though, is you know, we can charge 29 bucks and because I used to actually work with, you know,"
"00:34:55,686 --> 00:35:03,479","at a publisher who did, you know, significant retail presence, I know the PNLs and like, literally our profit margin"
"00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:11,399","and the profit margin we have for like a $59 box product, are the same thing, because with the box product you got to like,"
"00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:12,469","you got preprint the stuff."
"00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:17,349","You got all the materials, you got to ship it and you got to store it, you know."
"00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:19,094","The extra store will take their cut."
"00:35:19,094 --> 00:35:21,623","There will be price protection involved."
"00:35:21,623 --> 00:35:24,156","There's a huge amount of expense that goes into it."
"00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:27,612","That like, yeah."
"00:35:27,612 --> 00:35:29,449","Profit margins are equal."
"00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:34,569","So we just got a lot, we got rid of a lot of waste."
"00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:36,689","Oh, there it is."
"00:35:36,689 --> 00:35:38,447","Rice: All right, Justin. We're live."
"00:35:38,447 --> 00:35:39,749","Bailey: I see it."
"00:35:39,749 --> 00:35:41,454","Rice: I'm going to push the update."
"00:35:41,454 --> 00:35:45,065","Bailey: Good. Do it."
"00:35:45,065 --> 00:35:49,425","Bailey: And it's interesting, 'cause they'd like, when you get in a top position, it's probably at least a hundred, a hundred thousand,"
"00:35:49,425 --> 00:35:51,133","a hundred fifty thousand dollars."
"00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:56,937","But it actually could be way north of that and I'd have no idea, because you're number one, right?"
"00:35:56,937 --> 00:35:59,655","So you could be very, very high up."
"00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:03,926","But that would be, that would be an amazing day for us, we could, we get in that top position."
"00:36:03,926 --> 00:36:06,846","Schafer: Sitting at my desk, looking at a picture of me sitting at my desk."
"00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:18,745","[Hums to self] Bailey: It's about an hour and twenty minutes delayed."
"00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:25,516","Bailey: Yeah. That will be when we actually see something."
"00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:29,181","I'll know at 11:00, 11:30 I'll have like the first indication."
"00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:32,801","I think the hour of celebration or reckoning or both has come."
"00:36:35,144 --> 00:36:36,401","Schafer: No, it's not Raz."
"00:36:36,401 --> 00:36:39,092","I don't see any boobs or penises on anything."
"00:36:39,092 --> 00:36:40,312","Choy: You have to look more closely."
"00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,020","Are you guys doing a standup?"
"00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,000","Schafer: We are going to do standups. Standups? Rice: Yeah."
"00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,141","Schafer: Whoever's left, whoever's left on the team, come on to standups."
"00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:55,357","We're now live for everybody in the world to buy the game on Steam."
"00:36:55,357 --> 00:36:56,818","That's it. That's all I had to say today."
"00:36:56,818 --> 00:36:59,368","OK. So Part Two."
"00:36:59,368 --> 00:37:00,248","It's like a back massage."
"00:37:00,248 --> 00:37:01,620","Bailey: Oh yeah, it's pretty good. That's not bad."
"00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,920","It's not, it's not as good now."
"00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,084","Schafer: It feels nice, yeah."
"00:37:10,084 --> 00:37:15,825","Schafer: So if the sales aren't good, I'll immediately smash your head with this so that you won't ever feel the pain of seeing bad sales."
"00:37:15,825 --> 00:37:17,376","Bailey: That's good. Deal."
"00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,383","All right, we doing this?"
"00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:25,688","Let's do, let's first just look at the, let's see, Top Ten List."
"00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:27,103","Schafer: I'm not going to look."
"00:37:27,103 --> 00:37:28,083","Bailey: Not looking at Top Ten List?"
"00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,120","Schafer: I don't care."
"00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,319","I'm not going to look."
"00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:32,019","Oh, oh! Look at that! Schafer: Holy cow!"
"00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:35,034","Bailey: You're number two on new releases."
"00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:37,483","That has no component to sales."
"00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:41,257","But top sellers, we are number four."
"00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:43,871","All right. Whoa!"
"00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:45,271","Oh, this is refreshed, the new releases."
"00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,500","Still number four. OK, cool. Sweet!"
"00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:54,496","Fifty thousand, five ninety-nine."
"00:37:54,496 --> 00:37:57,885","That is 2,000 units on Steam. Schafer: Hm?"
"00:37:57,885 --> 00:38:00,023","Bailey: That's 2,000 units on Steam."
"00:38:00,023 --> 00:38:01,158","Yeah, this is good."
"00:38:01,158 --> 00:38:02,567","This will, this will be good."
"00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:09,722","If we get over 100K today, I think that's a, it's a very good day and I expect that European sales usually hit overnight."
"00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:11,782","So I would expect that to double."
"00:38:13,736 --> 00:38:15,671","Schafer: Double today. Bailey: Yeah."
"00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:16,814","Schafer: By the end of the day."
"00:38:16,814 --> 00:38:18,178","Bailey: Between now and the end of the day."
"00:38:18,178 --> 00:38:19,479","Probably more than double."
"00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:28,554","This'll probably be like, I would say like 125 to 150, which means that would take us over nine million for Double Fine lifetime revenue."
"00:38:28,554 --> 00:38:31,840","Schafer: Hm. Bailey: It should be very, very cool."
"00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:38,338","And I actually expect, I do expect the trend of the game to, to stay, we'll have a spike right now,"
"00:38:38,338 --> 00:38:41,778","but I think it'll actually be pretty steady after that, so that's good."
"00:38:45,052 --> 00:38:47,314","Schafer: OK. Now pretend the cameras are off now. Bailey: Now pretend?"
"00:38:47,314 --> 00:38:48,789","Schafer: Tell me what you really think."
"00:38:48,789 --> 00:38:50,416","Bailey: It's, it is what I expected."
"00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:55,916","Schafer: OK. All right. Exciting. Cool."
"00:38:57,852 --> 00:38:59,178","Now I don't want anyone to look at it."
"00:38:59,178 --> 00:39:01,838","I guess I'll go deisgn Act Two. Bailey: Yeah."
"00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,995","Offscreen Voice: It's not earth shattering."
"00:39:04,588 --> 00:39:11,901","Bailey: It's not earth shattering, but it's on track to do what we need it to do, you know, to get the game finished this year."
"00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:18,628","The only unfortunate part about this whole thing is that I was looking at all of our news broadcasts"
"00:39:18,628 --> 00:39:25,488","and basically, you know, basic, all the news, all the exposure went out when the backers got it, like two weeks ago."
"00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:32,648","And people didn't have a chance to literally like, you know, hey, I'll, I'll buy it now and I can play it now."
"00:39:32,648 --> 00:39:41,600","You know, that's hard to, as like a, you know, value proposition for consumer, it's hard to see everybody talking about this and be like,"
"00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,963","oh, I can pay for it and still not get to play it."
"00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:48,063","But it'll hopefully come out in the wash."
"00:39:55,221 --> 00:39:59,801","Rice: It was the last, I think it was very last bar."
"00:40:03,886 --> 00:40:08,052","Schafer: I think we can confirm now that we chose the right code name."
"00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:11,299","It didn't sound like the right code name, but now look at it; Red's."
"00:40:11,299 --> 00:40:35,980","[Music] Schafer: Yeah. Let's talk about that."
"00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,483","We shipped Red's last week."
"00:40:37,483 --> 00:40:38,544","I don't know if you guys noticed that."
"00:40:38,544 --> 00:40:40,193","We shipped the game, it was awesome."
"00:40:40,193 --> 00:40:41,364","Yah, Red's."
"00:40:41,364 --> 00:40:43,079","[Applause]."
"00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:46,121","It has, everybody claps just for shipping it."
"00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:48,891","I think I've gotten claps out of you guys for like..."
"00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,406","Schafer: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,235","And next week we're shipping Red's."
"00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:56,644","Next week it'll mean two weeks since we shipped Red's."
"00:40:56,644 --> 00:41:02,279","It has, it has made about $800,000 so far on the old Steam thing, which is fun."
"00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:09,578","And so that is an interesting number, because it was kind of a relief in one hand because we were like,"
"00:41:09,578 --> 00:41:12,504","get a lot of possibilities here, one of them is that we don't make any money."
"00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:14,275","No one buys the game, we can't make Part Two."
"00:41:14,275 --> 00:41:17,554","But I think we, luckily, because that would have been an easy update, though."
"00:41:17,554 --> 00:41:23,240","We would have called all the haters on Twitter and just been like, you guys were totally right."
"00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,804","I'm a huge a-hole and we're not going to do Part Two."
"00:41:25,804 --> 00:41:28,701","But that doesn't seem to be a risk anymore."
"00:41:28,701 --> 00:41:33,370","We are also kind of hoping like, what if it made so much money that we didn't ever have to make games anymore?"
"00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,881","We could just hang around and play games all day in the office."
"00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,314","Schafer: And we also don't make Act Two."
"00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,280","Yeah, either way Act Two is like."
"00:41:43,591 --> 00:41:52,019","Yeah, I mean, that's not a big enough number that we're going to be immediately, completely independent of publishers this year,"
"00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:54,438","like it was a secret back in my head, kind of hope."
"00:41:54,438 --> 00:41:57,043","Where all my hopes are in the back of my head."
"00:41:57,043 --> 00:41:58,554","Any other questions?"
"00:42:04,485 --> 00:42:10,028","Schafer: It's just under 20,000, I think. So, so far."
"00:42:11,424 --> 00:42:14,084","Schafer: We are. Yeah, so that's just to finish the whole Red's update."
"00:42:14,084 --> 00:42:18,499","What the team is working on now is a lot of, instead of diving into Part Two, is actually platform work."
"00:42:18,499 --> 00:42:25,139","You get it out on more platforms to sell it on like IOS and the other platforms."
"00:42:29,658 --> 00:42:32,215","Schafer: Sooner than we had previously thought we were going to do it."
"00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:35,012","Skillman: So it would be Act One available on iOS."
"00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:37,613","Schafer: Yeah. OK. Let's talk about PR."
"00:42:37,613 --> 00:42:39,345","PR. What happened in the world of PR last week?"
"00:42:39,345 --> 00:42:41,246","Rice: Well, like you said we launched Broken Age."
"00:42:41,246 --> 00:42:43,308","So it's been a lot of, yay! Yay!"
"00:42:43,308 --> 00:42:46,411","[Applause]."
"00:42:46,411 --> 00:42:50,917","Yeah. So it's been trying to keep that conversation going in the public as much as possible."
"00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:53,463","So those are ongoing kind of conversations."
"00:42:53,463 --> 00:43:00,561","But yeah, now we're kind of shifting focus to AF stuff and getting everything ready to announce and launch that thing."
"00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,860","Schafer: Yeah, OK, that's it."
"00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,540","I think all of you would agree with me that Chris Remo's a big jerk."
"00:43:08,943 --> 00:43:10,548","I think, yeah."
"00:43:10,548 --> 00:43:16,043","[Scattered applause] And furthermore we were all talking about it and decided we didn't like him."
"00:43:16,043 --> 00:43:24,103","So I don't want that to influence you at all, but I think we need to have, Chris Remo is moving onto hang out with his friends,"
"00:43:24,103 --> 00:43:26,873","which is bad news for all of his, whatever you guys are."
"00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,500","But, I've been saving that one all week."
"00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:41,663","So, but you're still here right now so, what happened last week in the world of the community of Double Fine?"
"00:43:41,663 --> 00:43:49,410","Remo: An important thing for our community is that we launched Broken Age [applause]."
"00:43:52,472 --> 00:43:59,756","That actually has been a cool thing to see because I'm seeing a lot of stuff from people who have never even necessarily played adventure games before."
"00:43:59,756 --> 00:44:01,349","Schafer: I love all those people."
"00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:06,657","Remo: Yeah. I mean there's, it's actually been kind of awesome to see, because a lot of them, you know, like with adventure game fans,"
"00:44:06,657 --> 00:44:13,159","people come to, people come to it with like preconceptions and like all the, you know, the history that they have with the genre."
"00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:16,765","And that's cool because that's the people that the game was inspired by in the first place."
"00:44:16,765 --> 00:44:24,070","But it's also really cool to see all the reactions from people who don't have those preconceptions, because they'll be like, yeah,"
"00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:26,778","so I was playing this thing and like I didn't know what it was and it seemed pretty cool."
"00:44:26,778 --> 00:44:29,450","You just kind of walk around and like cool stuff happens."
"00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,370","And like it was actually really awesome."
"00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:34,511","And that kind of thing is surprisingly cool to read."
"00:44:34,511 --> 00:44:40,426","So I've been trying to keep up with that stuff, just around the web and it's been really inspiring and awesome."
"00:44:40,426 --> 00:44:41,046","Schafer: Anything else?"
"00:44:41,046 --> 00:44:45,026","Mr. Remo? Anything? Anything else."
"00:44:45,026 --> 00:44:46,913","Remo: I will miss you guys a lot."
"00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,829","I really loved working here a lot and I'm bummed to be leaving."
"00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:53,531","Schafer: Well, we'll miss you, wish you well and we still think you're a big jerk."
"00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,691","Who agrees with me?"
"00:44:56,691 --> 00:45:38,341","[Applause] [Music]"
"00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,942","Offscreen Voice: [singing] I guess he's not a monster, but he's so far away."
"00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:56,160","Shay, we're meant to be for longer than forever."
"00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,683","Offscreen Voice: Who cares about Shay?"
"00:45:57,683 --> 00:45:59,339","I have evil deeds to do."
"00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,072","I used to be good like everyone else and Shay, but no!"
"00:46:03,335 --> 00:46:05,475","I am actually evil."
"00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,111","Offscreen Voice: [singing] for longer than forever."
"00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,434","As constant as the stars."
"00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:18,734","I close my eyes and I am where you are."
