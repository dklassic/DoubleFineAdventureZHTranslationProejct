"00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,180","Schafer: Mmm, my new notebook."
"00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,575","did you notice I brought my old and my new notebooks?"
"00:00:39,395 --> 00:00:41,663","Can you believe I filled this up?"
"00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:46,287","Remember? This old notebook."
"00:00:46,287 --> 00:00:47,682","It's all full."
"00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:50,921","Now there's the design for the last shot in the game."
"00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:53,239","Can't show you, you guys always use those."
"00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:54,400","So yeah, this is the new notebook."
"00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:01,996","And this is kind of a disaster first, because this, I didn't notice until I started it, it's wide ruled, instead of college rule."
"00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,736","And this game is definitely college level."
"00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:10,024","But I decided actually this will make me feel like we got a lot more work done, 'cause my free writing will fill up more pages."
"00:01:10,024 --> 00:01:13,733","Yeah, I purposely got white so it'd feel pristine and fresh."
"00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:17,345","It's smaller This is like totally like a baby notebook."
"00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:19,968","It does! It makes me look stupid, doesn't it?"
"00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:23,849","But then again, I'm getting older so it's hard to see stuff."
"00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:25,149","New notebook."
"00:01:26,593 --> 00:01:55,112","[Music] Schafer: Yeah. Let's talk about stuff."
"00:01:55,112 --> 00:01:56,629","We shipped Red's last week."
"00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:58,120","I don't know if you guys noticed that, we shipped a game."
"00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,180","It was awesome."
"00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,040","Yay, Red's."
"00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:08,283","[Applause] It has, it has, it has made about $800,000 so far on the old Steam thing,"
"00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:09,772","which is fun."
"00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:17,582","And that's not a big enough number that we're going to be immediately completely independent of publishers this year,"
"00:02:17,582 --> 00:02:20,169","like was a secret, back of my head kind of hope."
"00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:22,371","Where all my hopes are in the back of my head."
"00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:30,439","It's a little, it's a little tricky financially because, pretty much, you know, I think conservatively we would estimate that"
"00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:33,234","we've made most of the money that we're going to make off of it."
"00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:35,905","We might make more when we release Part Two, but it's not going to be equal."
"00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,341","It's not going to be like the equal amount of sales."
"00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:45,930","So we're working on something that is, we're usually working on something like, oh, when this, when we release it, it'll make a bunch of money for us"
"00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,621","and that'll pay for more stuff and so we already got, or kind of got that money in advance twice."
"00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:55,230","Offscreen Voice: So you're making a bigger, more complex game that you know isn't going to sell as well?"
"00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,185","Schafer: Yeah. Yep. Just from love."
"00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:01,616","This time it's just for love."
"00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:03,919","That's our slogan."
"00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,019","The money is gone, now we're just running on love."
"00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,345","No, I mean, the first part made enough money."
"00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:13,879","It definitely made its numbers."
"00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:20,761","I mean, it was, we went through these phases of like let's, let's estimate, you know, conservatively, because it's an adventure game"
"00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:25,539","and you know, we had a conservative estimate for it, how much it would sell."
"00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,316","Schafer: Everyone think in your head, how many units this game is going to sell."
"00:03:29,316 --> 00:03:30,940","How many do you think it's going to sell?"
"00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,933","Rice: A million."
"00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,185","Schafer: A million?"
"00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:34,665","How many you think's going to sell?"
"00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:38,616","Bailey: 150,000 year one."
"00:03:38,616 --> 00:03:39,763","Schafer: What do you say?"
"00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:42,956","Stamos: I was going to say 200, but I was thinking more lifetime."
"00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:47,221","Schafer: So let's say it was 300."
"00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:53,363","And then somewhere along the line we got really excited about people's response to it and excited by the game itself and how much we liked it."
"00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:59,837","And you can see this, you know, part of us were like, hey now, if this does really, really well, it might change a lot of stuff for us."
"00:03:59,837 --> 00:04:06,904","Stoddard: A lot of people here kind of hang on because like, they know, they know Tim, they know, they know the management,"
"00:04:06,904 --> 00:04:11,059","they know the vision and if it hits, it'll, it'll be really good."
"00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:12,029","It'll be really good."
"00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:15,831","So we're just hanging in."
"00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:17,451","Schafer: And you could see that in like Camden."
"00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:20,683","I think Camden was like a lot of people were, kind of hoping for it."
"00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:21,995","And it didn't sell that much."
"00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:25,138","It didn't sell so much that it changed our whole business plan for the year."
"00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:27,750","It sold what we kind of estimated originally."
"00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,491","Schafer: So far it's made about 1.6 million dollars on Steam, which is awesome."
"00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:36,465","And it's, by, that's about 70,000 people purchased it; about 80,000 were the backers."
"00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:39,048","So that's about 150,000 units out there."
"00:04:39,048 --> 00:04:42,566","Schafer: And so that's, I don't want be too sad about it [inaudible 00:04:41]."
"00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:47,965","Just a little part of me was like, what if, you know, it's always part of you that hopes what if something really,"
"00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:52,601","like a big, you know, outlier thing is just crazy, hits."
"00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:54,723","It just unexpectedly, like our Kickstarter."
"00:04:54,723 --> 00:05:00,001","Once you have an experience like that, it's hard to go back to the normal world where things sell what you expect them to."
"00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:05,461","Bailey: One thing I am a little interested in, I'm not, not sure, is that, you know, we just don't have, we're not doing any marketing."
"00:05:05,461 --> 00:05:08,014","We're not spending any money on marketing."
"00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:13,311","And one thing I'm just looking at is to get around that, you know, we do a lot of press presence, a lot of social media."
"00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:19,607","We rely upon features on the distributors, in this case with Steam and Valve."
"00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:23,502","But it's like what, how much does banner ads help?"
"00:05:23,502 --> 00:05:25,978","And you know, those other traditional forms of marketing."
"00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:30,357","And it is something I'd like to look at in the future, 'cause that will be the one thing I think publishers"
"00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:32,947","have done different than we haven't done."
"00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:35,328","I think, any of our fans want us to be successful commercially."
"00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:40,675","This whole thing is for naught if, you know, if we don't come out of it able to be more independent and then, you know,"
"00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:44,447","be able to create more creative works independently."
"00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:50,225","So you know, I think we need to take that into consideration when we come up with our, our plans for Act Two."
"00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:55,672","Maybe we're really lucky to have split the game in two, because then it gets some more chances."
"00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:59,431","And then we have more platforms coming up, so yeah, I think it will be good."
"00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:04,405","Schafer: We are. Yeah, so that's just to finish the whole Red's update."
"00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:09,070","What the team is working on now is a lot of, instead of diving into Part Two, is actually platform work."
"00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:15,470","You get it out on more platforms, to sell it on like IOS and the other platforms."
"00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:22,595","Schafer: Sooner than we had previously thought we were going to do it."
"00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:27,613","Schafer: The sales of the game make it look like the people who bought the game are people who played adventure games before."
"00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:29,802","It seems like we found those people."
"00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:33,166","But we haven't quite gotten yet to all the people who've never played adventure games before."
"00:06:35,971 --> 00:06:44,591","Rice: The idea was while we were waiting for design and writing for Act Two stuff, that we can try and jump on some of these platform work to fill time."
"00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:48,804","And potentially even move forward some of those platform releases."
"00:06:48,804 --> 00:06:50,341","Kipnis: Hi, we have some questions for you."
"00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:51,837","Rice: We do have a pressing question for you."
"00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:55,371","Schafer: There's a lot of work that Oliver has to get done before the iPad version can come out."
"00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:58,033","But that's a version I'm waiting for."
"00:06:58,033 --> 00:06:59,922","Well, all of them, waiting for all of them."
"00:06:59,922 --> 00:07:03,195","Hansen: From a studio standpoint the most important thing is still the platform work,"
"00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:06,857","because we want to make sure that we can get the ports out as soon as possible."
"00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:08,580","Franzke: Right."
"00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,165","Franzke: And yeah, it's been going pretty well."
"00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:19,069","It's just, you know, it's a lot of work, just kind of looking at those platforms and seeing kind of how is the game performing on that"
"00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:22,229","and what other kind of very specific issues."
"00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:26,023","Schafer: It's awesome."
"00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:27,369","So I get to keep this, right?"
"00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:33,165","Franzke: Also just generally us getting the infrastructure in place to, to kind of launch games on those platforms."
"00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:40,135","Very often, you know, different storefronts require, have different requirements when it comes how you deliver the product."
"00:07:40,135 --> 00:07:47,918","You know, it's very different delivering something to Google Play store versus the iOS app store versus the Mac app store and things like that."
"00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:53,364","So there'll a whole bunch of infrastructure things that we need to put in place."
"00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:56,296","And so I've been working on those a lot."
"00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:59,483","So as you can, there's still some stuff that's broken."
"00:07:59,483 --> 00:08:03,022","For example, some invalid textures here and there that shouldn't be there."
"00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:04,791","I need to investigate what's going on."
"00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:09,388","You should be able to play through the game from the beginning to end, which is huge."
"00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:16,467","But as you can see, you know, the game, the game runs and I would even have sound."
"00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:23,785","[Sound from iPad] Franzke: Oh, great. All right."
"00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:28,748","Offscreen Voice: I mean, traditionally, like port houses handle moving stuff to different platforms."
"00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:32,402","So like why do it internally and not just hand it off to someone?"
"00:08:32,402 --> 00:08:38,864","Franzke: Because the intrinsic goal for an external port house is different than what our intrinsic goal is."
"00:08:38,864 --> 00:08:44,091","For a port house, it's like, well, our contract says we have to get it done for this platform, for this amount of money."
"00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:48,010","So we will employ any hack that we can think of to make this work."
"00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:57,840","Like, we'll, like essentially you're throwing out any, any kind of way of like clean software development is the first thing that goes."
"00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:04,395","And that's OK as a developer, if it's a product that's done and you're never going to touch it again"
"00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:07,778","and you get the code back and you just archive it and that's it."
"00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:13,357","But if it's something that you will have to work with in the future, you don't want to do that."
"00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,541","Franzke: I don't know."
"00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,924","Criticism makes me always smile."
"00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:30,866","Franzke: We'll find out."
"00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:33,639","Let's hope so, right?"
"00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,018","Schafer: I made it for the hardcore fans, only the hardcore fans."
"00:09:37,018 --> 00:09:40,770","I was only thinking of the hardcore fans and I hate everyone who's not a hardcore fan."
"00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,065","Someone came up to me at PAX and was like, hey, I really like Broken Age."
"00:09:44,065 --> 00:09:46,232","It seemed really short, though."
"00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:50,326","It seemed like they cared more about getting Elijah Wood than putting money into puzzles."
"00:09:50,326 --> 00:09:52,658","It's like, first of all, who are you saying ""they""?"
"00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,451","That's me."
"00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:57,611","And that's not how the money worked on the project."
"00:09:57,611 --> 00:10:00,606","Go and, oh why am I talking to you?"
"00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:02,915","Schafer: [High pitched voice] I was disappointed in your game."
"00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:04,199","I just wanted you to know."
"00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:05,727","Schafer: You have a good point."
"00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:07,211","I should quit the games industry."
"00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:13,405","Schafer: Yay! You fans."
"00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,083","I am excited about all the things you're asking me about."
"00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,772","I am really, I am excited about coming on the iPad."
"00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:23,990","I'm hoping people who have never played adventure games will give it a shot and like it and play it."
"00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,045","But we didn't, you know, dumb the game down for them."
"00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:29,984","We just made it the way we wanted to make it."
"00:10:29,984 --> 00:10:32,001","Offscreen Voice: How much time do you have left to work on this?"
"00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:35,722","'Cause it seems like people are starting to roll back into Broken Age."
"00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:36,874","Franzke: Yes. Yeah."
"00:10:36,874 --> 00:10:40,132","I mean, this is the other thing that's always been happening right now."
"00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:45,442","We're kind of also working on starting to work on Act Two, which is nice."
"00:10:45,442 --> 00:10:46,856","Schafer: Let's talk about Red's."
"00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,233","Remember Red's, it's not done yet."
"00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,583","Part One is up."
"00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,225","Part Two we got to do now."
"00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:52,231","Schafer: That was crazy."
"00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:58,577","I've never, would never have done anything like that where we shipped something and then immediately, except for like Kinect Party."
"00:10:58,577 --> 00:11:01,031","But I've never had to go back into a game after finishing it."
"00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:07,863","Usually like, I finish the game and I immediately like look away from it and just walk off into the desert and never look at it again."
"00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:10,068","Until like ten years later or something like that."
"00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:13,849","Schafer: Well, we're so used to like shipping a game and then mentally your brain starts to heal and close off,"
"00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:17,559","like, it's like you would like, like you have a baby."
"00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:20,605","You know how it is when you guys have a baby, right?"
"00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:23,786","You like, and then your body starts, all right, let's pretend that never happened."
"00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:25,098","Let's just heal up, umm."
"00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:29,098","But no. It's like, there's twins."
"00:11:29,098 --> 00:11:30,277","There's another one coming."
"00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:32,472","Rice: Yay, twins."
"00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:35,571","Schafer: And so, normally I would just be like, OK, that's done."
"00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:36,610","You know, what's next?"
"00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:41,267","But it's like, oh yeah, there's a whole other part of the meaty part of the story that we have to get into."
"00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:45,024","Like explaining all the crazy stuff that happened in Act One."
"00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:48,044","Schafer: And Lee, you're still on, you're still working on it or you're?"
"00:11:48,044 --> 00:11:50,194","Petty: You seem surprised."
"00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:51,830","Schafer: I just know you're in demand."
"00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,230","Petty: You're in the office?"
"00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,598","Petty: Here's all Act Two's threads I started."
"00:11:54,598 --> 00:11:57,325","So these are all some of the concepts works we've been doing."
"00:11:57,325 --> 00:12:05,193","So you can see some of them are revisiting characters or like changes to recurring characters or scene modifications from Act One, new props."
"00:12:05,193 --> 00:12:07,498","Or here's, here's like a puzzles one, you know."
"00:12:07,498 --> 00:12:13,231","Curtis is now into metal working so he had all these, he needed a table in his room."
"00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:16,830","So we were trying to figure out the positioning of the table and what they needed to do"
"00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,817","and Tim was like, yeah, that looks too useful with all those tongs on there."
"00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:21,798","Get rid of the tongs."
"00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:22,889","And hey, those guys are too far apart."
"00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:24,177","They can't be in a cut scene together."
"00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:27,519","So I'm like, oh, what I'm hearing is like, yeah, that's great but now they're blocking the molds."
"00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,833","So put them here and here."
"00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:34,186","So we're kind of like, I'm trying to just work through as much as that as fast as possible without having to program anything."
"00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:39,114","And I mentioned story beats so Bagel's did a lot of these early on as he kind of went through that."
"00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:43,941","Yeah, so a lot of this stuff is just like, you know, we're both kind of working on different aspects of the same thing, you know."
"00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:46,295","Just kind of like print a breakdown, what the characters might be doing."
"00:12:46,295 --> 00:12:50,115","I was trying to breakdown what changes to the space and puzzles would have on that."
"00:12:50,115 --> 00:12:56,620","Schafer: Right now on the project I think our animators are all out in the field, free-ranging across the company, helping out."
"00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:02,021","But our programmers are still on and we're going to meet today with anyone who's still around"
"00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:05,400","to talk about the puzzles for Act Two and get that kicked off."
"00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,268","Schafer: Welcome, everybody."
"00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:10,429","Thank you for coming and still being on the Red's team, even though we shipped some of it."
"00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:11,848","Kipnis: Unlike some people."
"00:13:11,848 --> 00:13:14,459","Petty: Yeah, I'm like, Schafer: What is wrong with the artists?"
"00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,020","Johnny-come-lately's."
"00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,441","Petty: That's not everybody at all."
"00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:18,441","Schafer: Johnny-leave-early's."
"00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:19,320","Kipnis: Johnny-leave-early's."
"00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:28,928","Schafer: Those people who do what we've asked them to do Schafer: So we could get this design all straightened away"
"00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:32,286","and start implementing it, Franzke: We're done?"
"00:13:32,286 --> 00:13:33,444","Schafer: And then we're done, right?"
"00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:34,715","I don't even know if there's a schedule."
"00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:36,758","We have a schedule?"
"00:13:36,758 --> 00:13:40,804","But we'll probably have a better schedule after we get this design all, actually tasked away."
"00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:41,604","Petty: Well, yeah."
"00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:45,144","I mean, I think the high level picture hasn't really changed in a long time."
"00:13:45,798 --> 00:13:49,635","You know, even before we finished Act One, I think the high level picture was still the same."
"00:13:49,635 --> 00:13:51,888","Yeah, it's like story beats from a long time ago."
"00:13:51,888 --> 00:13:54,350","And he and I have talked about it on a high level."
"00:13:54,350 --> 00:14:01,644","So I don't think that's changed, but a lot of the very specific puzzles or cut scenes haven't been designed or written yet."
"00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:03,970","And some of that has changed since Act One, you know."
"00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:09,724","So I think Tim took the feedback of a lot of people wanting a more challenging game."
"00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:13,947","Schafer: So how much harder are we going to make the second half of the game?"
"00:14:13,947 --> 00:14:16,557","Franzke: Much harder. Schafer: Much harder?"
"00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,889","Schafer: Every once in a while I design something, like there's no way anyone would ever get, OK, let's put that in."
"00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:26,367","Kipnis: You want hard?"
"00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:28,142","We'll give you hard."
"00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:29,345","Franzke: We're going to give you hard."
"00:14:29,345 --> 00:14:32,733","Schafer: Well, it did seem trying to reconcile people complaining about the difficulty with how it felt in play-testing"
"00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:36,311","when like people weren't getting out of the train thing."
"00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:41,851","And like, 'cause it was a reaction to like how miserable people appeared to be when they were stuck."
"00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:50,507","Kipnis: Yeah, someone, someone made a post on the forum that was really astute about how a lot of the difficulty that the old adventure games had was obfuscation."
"00:14:50,507 --> 00:15:00,480","Like the fact that you had like ten verbs and you had like 20,000 items made it seem a lot harder than if it was, you know, a more limited choice or whatever."
"00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,916","Franzke: And no Internet."
"00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,510","Kipnis: Yeah, and no Internet, exactly."
"00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,870","Franzke: No, seriously. Schafer: Yeah."
"00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,918","and no real play testing."
"00:15:06,918 --> 00:15:08,510","Some play-testing, but not like we did."
"00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,813","We've kind of gone for like slicker, slicker inventory."
"00:15:10,813 --> 00:15:12,773","And we did that over the course of those adventure games, too."
"00:15:12,773 --> 00:15:17,465","Like Throttle had like a very small inventory and of course people said that was too easy and short."
"00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:18,686","There you go."
"00:15:18,686 --> 00:15:20,936","Schafer: I mean, would we want to add another row to the inventory because of that?"
"00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:22,538","Would we want to have a double stack inventory?"
"00:15:22,538 --> 00:15:25,729","Like Vella shrinks down and then Shay can carry her around?"
"00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:30,589","And you can open her up and get her inventory. Whoa."
"00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:36,860","I'm trying to just, just general good design stuff is watching out for things where you find a solution before you find a problem."
"00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,641","And you know, I mean I was trying to find those in Act One, too."
"00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:45,154","But some things you just never, are not clear."
"00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:50,743","Well, let me fly through this and then we can just highlight some things to come back to later."
"00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:56,684","Well, there's some like challenges I'm trying to achieve with the second act, like the interaction between Shay and Vella."
"00:15:56,684 --> 00:16:02,852","Maybe not in direct interaction, but more relevance of the switching back and forth, making that more relevant."
"00:16:02,852 --> 00:16:06,630","Even if it's just information that passes back and forth in your brain."
"00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:14,643","And I'm really thinking about how to wrap up the character arcs in the end, 'cause mostly with adventure games you have a story"
"00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:17,383","but you tend to think about the progress of the story as being the puzzles."
"00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:21,281","And I solve a whole bunch of puzzles and then they win, do you know what I mean?"
"00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:27,457","Whereas if you're writing a movie you'd be thinking about the total ups and downs these characters are going through."
"00:16:27,457 --> 00:16:34,089","And so I'm focusing a lot more on that, 'cause I really want it to be satisfying, how the characters end up in the end."
"00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:41,409","Not just they achieved all their small goals and add it to one big goal, but they actually had a moment of you know, some real lows and highs"
"00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:45,179","and that the ending actually meant something to the characters."
"00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:46,913","Hopefully."
"00:16:46,913 --> 00:16:52,506","But it's easy to get distracted by the mechanics of solving puzzles and think that the story is kind of resolving."
"00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:55,417","And the ""A"" plot does resolve in adventure games."
"00:16:55,417 --> 00:17:04,291","Like your action plot resolves because the character achieves their goals, but the ""B"" plot's like the emotional plot often, it's kind of left."
"00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,803","Where it's summed up by the two characters kissing at the end or something like that."
"00:17:07,804 --> 00:17:13,810","But to have actually sum up in a meaningful way for the characters is something I have to do."
"00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,620","Schafer: The game?"
"00:17:19,382 --> 00:17:21,827","Schafer: May? No."
"00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:26,502","I really am trying everything to make sure the game comes out this year."
"00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:27,850","And then people always go what?"
"00:17:27,851 --> 00:17:31,445","And then I say, the first act took two years."
"00:17:31,445 --> 00:17:37,333","And so if the second act can take less than one year, it's a miracle."
"00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,553","And that's what we're doing."
"00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:46,022","Rice: If the directive is we want to ship by the end of the year, I think we've talked a lot about like things that would need to happen"
"00:17:46,407 --> 00:17:52,245","to make that doable, to like where if we timeboxed a scheduled to December,"
"00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:55,183","we'd still have to do some stuff to pull it in a little bit."
"00:17:55,183 --> 00:17:58,420","I think that's the conversation that we need to have, I guess."
"00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:05,570","'Cause if not, like it's going to be very easy to just keep pushing stuff back like we did on Act One."
"00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:11,518","Schafer: Well, the two big reasons, two of the big reasons are, or three, there's like backer expectations because they,"
"00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:14,239","a lot of people thought it was going to come out like two months after Act One."
"00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:17,166","So that message thing that we kind of have to get out to people."
"00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:22,197","Like a couple people I've talked to, it's like I hope it's coming out this year, so there's like that."
"00:18:22,197 --> 00:18:28,809","There is financial, just that Justin has been working with December in all his financial planning, you know."
"00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:31,045","So that's a pretty hard thing."
"00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:34,360","Rice: Yeah, both for getting profit in and for spending on the project."
"00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,206","Schafer: Yeah."
"00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:40,586","And for me, just the possibility of actually being up for awards because we shipped the first half this year."
"00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:50,409","So we're either going to be not eligible for 2014 awards or really coming out in January or March of 2015,"
"00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:53,135","when everyone will forget about it by the time the '15 awards come out."
"00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:54,773","So there's that."
"00:18:54,773 --> 00:19:00,659","Rice: I think those are all the right reasons and all the reasons that I feel like everyone I've talked to about this wants to really make December happen,"
"00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:08,731","but I think that it's, it's just going in knowing that that would mean like, doing whatever it takes to make that happen."
"00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,834","And sacrificing in some ways."
"00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:13,935","Petty: It's possible. It's possible."
"00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:18,095","You know, most video game productions are a series of bottlenecks."
"00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:24,056","And trying to get everything unblocked with minimal bottlenecks is what's going to make or break December."
"00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:28,646","Although the other problem with December is there's a lot of unknowns as it comes to puzzle playability and testing."
"00:19:28,646 --> 00:19:33,439","So we can take certain steps, like we can try and work through earlier versions or script early versions and test them,"
"00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:38,919","but you know, ultimately that's the fun factor and that's a little hard to know how that's going to hit."
"00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:45,329","And when you don't leave yourself a lot of iteration time, it may not be enough and you don't really know."
"00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:47,017","Schafer: I think we can do December."
"00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:49,524","To me it's like an infinity far away."
"00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:53,379","I always think we can do anything."
"00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:56,411","That's why my games are sometimes late."
"00:19:56,411 --> 00:20:01,862","Schafer: It's really just the best game that we can make and we feel like we can actually make without crashing the company into the ground."
"00:20:01,862 --> 00:20:06,203","And they also just want to finish it because it's, while it's fresh in people's minds."
"00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:11,010","And I do want to get the team back and there's a pressure to keep them on other projects because they have these publisher milestones."
"00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:16,645","And publisher milestones are always scarier than internal milestones, because there's no outside force threatening to"
"00:20:16,645 --> 00:20:19,749","not pay you if you don't meet the milestones."
"00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:22,584","So we have to be that threatening outside force."
"00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:25,582","Can you make some phone calls from outside the building with a funny voice?"
"00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:26,641","Hansen: I can."
"00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:31,183","Schafer: And be like, we won't pay you guys if you don't meet your milestones on this project."
"00:20:31,183 --> 00:20:33,123","Hansen: I'm pretty sure they're going to figure out that it's me."
"00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:36,393","Schafer: Well, that's the other big factor, right."
"00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:41,327","Is we went to this smaller team, which I think from a budget standpoint was a good idea, 'cause you were writing."
"00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:44,239","Bagel and I could do some early concept work and stuff."
"00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:48,549","If we were working from a no, this is the target deadline, that is not a good way to work."
"00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:53,552","If it's a, this is our target budget and so we're lowering the berm while we figure stuff out."
"00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:59,801","But if we were like, no, this is an unmovable time here in December, then we should have, I mean this is in hindsight,"
"00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:06,352","but we probably should have tried to get more of the team and start full production like right after AF or something."
"00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:07,986","Hansen: Yeah, but we couldn't have."
"00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:11,861","There wasn't enough design to execute on at that point."
"00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:15,703","Petty: Perhaps. But I mean, I'm just, you know, that's, I think it's just one of the other factors,"
"00:21:15,703 --> 00:21:20,502","I think, is that it felt good to have a small team for a while, while we sort of like could digest some of these things"
"00:21:20,502 --> 00:21:21,958","and Oliver was working on a platform."
"00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,775","But it did sort of put this maybe end date a little bit in jeopardy."
"00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:26,326","Team Member: That's very true."
"00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:31,089","Schafer: So maybe Oliver's stuff will make so much money we can have more time to make Act Two."
"00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,125","Rice: It sounds like we're not going to have more time, though, right?"
"00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,261","It sounds like we could have more money to throw at the problem and put..."
"00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:40,181","Schafer: Oh yeah. Maybe that will make more, we'll buy some more people."
"00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:46,976","Franzke: Yeah. It works pretty well."
"00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:51,336","I'm overall, like pretty happy with how it turned out."
"00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:53,376","The load times aren't terrible."
"00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:57,576","You know, we were able to get a lot of visual fidelity out of the game."
"00:21:57,576 --> 00:22:04,989","You know, essentially making it look as good as on PC, which I'm pretty happy about."
"00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,809","So if I go on the app store."
"00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:10,828","What is cool, is like obviously if you go to games, it's right there, Broken Age."
"00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:13,296","It's also in Best New Games, which is nice."
"00:22:13,296 --> 00:22:16,441","And that seems to be trending pretty well also in the charts."
"00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:19,968","So I would say overall, so far it's been a really successful launch."
"00:22:19,968 --> 00:22:26,109","Schafer: Last night I spent unknown hours playing through Broken Age and I'm so glad I did but I didn't know I was going to end unfinished."
"00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:28,109","Uh oh."
"00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:32,445","We don't really call it Part One on the app store."
"00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:36,672","I should say Part, should I say, does this guy say Part Two coming soon."
"00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:38,066","Should I say ""soon""?"
"00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:43,121","If children love this as much as Day of the Tentacle or Psychonauts, then please mark me as fuddy-duddy and ignore me."
"00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:44,588","OK, where do I do that?"
"00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:45,958","It was like no game I've ever played."
"00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,538","It doesn't glitch or crash."
"00:22:49,095 --> 00:22:51,596","The story is great and I can't wait for Act Two."
"00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:52,394","Two stars."
"00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:53,577","Not as advertised."
"00:22:53,577 --> 00:22:58,172","This game says ages 9 through 11 and that's about all I think would be fun for."
"00:22:58,172 --> 00:22:59,539","Oh, and the fake train wreck?"
"00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:00,969","Why are we doing this over and over again?"
"00:23:00,969 --> 00:23:04,573","The kid actually says he'd rather jump off a cliff than do it again or something like that."
"00:23:04,573 --> 00:23:05,778","That's how I feel as well."
"00:23:05,778 --> 00:23:07,092","Please refund."
"00:23:07,092 --> 00:23:09,112","There's no way this game is worth the price."
"00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:15,825","I think he' stuck on the train."
"00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:18,325","So maybe that wasn't too easy after all."
"00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:22,991","Anyway. Overall it's really good."
"00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,700","On the iPad."
"00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,221","Schafer: Very happy with the iPad launch."
"00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,300","I'm good."
"00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:35,169","Franzke: I think we will know in a few days, kind of from some of our third-party tools that send us information about app sales."
"00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:38,489","But yeah, fingers crossed."
"00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:43,415","Bailey: So moving on, Broken Age did decent sales on iPhone."
"00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,400","Stamos: iPad."
"00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,727","Bailey: iPad, sorry."
"00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:51,100","Decent enough that we're looking into doing iPhone and potentially android tablets with it."
"00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,591","So that was good."
"00:23:53,591 --> 00:23:54,875","It's meeting forecasts."
"00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:58,355","It's not like a runaway hit, but it's, you know, it's good."
"00:23:58,355 --> 00:23:59,735","It's decent cash flow."
"00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,500","So the numbers right now are about 100,000 for, you know, four days."
"00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:09,450","So expect for the actual feature week, while I'd say editor's choice, it'll probably be around 150,000"
"00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:15,387","and then it'll probably go down about one-fourth of that for the next week, while it's as a previous editor's choice."
"00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,707","So yeah, decent, decent numbers."
"00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,623","Bailey: So it was received well."
"00:24:19,623 --> 00:24:25,391","It looks like it's, it's, it's doing what our expectations were sales-wise."
"00:24:25,772 --> 00:24:28,548","Offscreen Voice: Expectations?"
"00:24:28,548 --> 00:24:34,382","Bailey: Yeah, I mean you can expect, you know, about 100 to $150,000 is what I expect out of a week"
"00:24:34,382 --> 00:24:38,941","for an iOS game that's a content-based game. Yeah."
"00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:41,677","Schafer: I think he was telling me they performed to his expectations."
"00:24:41,677 --> 00:24:48,163","They met his sales forecast, but of course forecasts are always pretty conservative."
"00:24:48,163 --> 00:24:51,339","So he's always secretly hoping that his sales forecasts are wrong."
"00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:57,304","Bailey: My expectation, just to be clear, though, they're more about, my expectations are more reflective of the current market"
"00:24:57,304 --> 00:25:01,010","on like iTunes for premium based games."
"00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,291","And like paid content based games."
"00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:09,391","So it's less of a reflection about the game and more a reflection about the market."
"00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:13,566","Schafer: We were at number four, now we're at number ten."
"00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:19,319","We might not be number ten anymore, but it was fun to be number four for a long time."
"00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:22,804","Well, we finally got pushed off ten."
"00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:28,123","Let's see how far down we are. Twenty-two."
"00:25:28,123 --> 00:25:30,969","This looks dirty."
"00:25:30,969 --> 00:25:33,965","Beaten by ""Frozen Karaoke""."
"00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:39,776","Schafer: Yeah, I mean, I'm happy with the performance on iPad, but I don't think it made a lot of extra money that's going to allow us"
"00:25:39,776 --> 00:25:42,655","to like hire another programmer and throw him at the team."
"00:25:42,655 --> 00:25:46,333","So I don't think it's going to change the schedule, unfortunately."
"00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:48,272","We can always hope."
"00:25:48,272 --> 00:25:56,481","I keep promising that I will stop hoping for those kind of things, but it's hard not to think about like, what if it was a big hit,"
"00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:58,641","then we could totally hire a programmer to help finish it."
"00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:04,691","But I don't know."
"00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:07,371","But I'm just happy it made enough that we can stay in business."
"00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,840","Bailey: It's just there's no magic bullet, basically."
"00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,133","So you know, it's, everything's a grind, especially in the game industry."
"00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:25,246","Like, you know, you have to have an amazing press and get the feature spots and get huge VO and have amazing polish and then do OK."
"00:26:25,246 --> 00:26:28,414","But if you didn't have any of that stuff, you'd do horrible."
"00:26:28,414 --> 00:26:33,300","So the, yeah. The hit."
"00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,600","The hit has been, has been elusive, for sure."
"00:26:39,980 --> 00:27:21,498","[Music] Schafer: What did you guys think of it?"
"00:27:21,498 --> 00:27:24,305","Offscreen Voice: What's that notepad that says, ""the end"" on it, right there."
"00:27:24,305 --> 00:27:26,722","Schafer: Oh. This is how things are going to end."
"00:27:26,722 --> 00:27:33,374","This is the guy who guessed that Shay's ship was Mog Chothra."
"00:27:33,374 --> 00:27:37,675","I'm super happy that no one seemed to have guessed the big spoiler at the end of it."
"00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:39,283","I really thought that was going to get out."
"00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:43,774","And actually long ago on the forum one guy guessed it."
"00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:45,606","And no one followed up on it."
"00:27:45,606 --> 00:27:49,188","Like no one, he just said his little thing, hey, what if this is the case?"
"00:27:49,188 --> 00:27:50,876","No one answered him."
"00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:52,682","I was like, oh man."
"00:27:52,682 --> 00:28:01,748","Schafer: By the way, since I was the guy who guessed that, by the way, here's how I figured out how it, how this, why I'm so smart."
"00:28:01,748 --> 00:28:04,993","And then here's how what I think is going to happen in Act Two."
"00:28:04,993 --> 00:28:06,455","Offscreen Voice: He's done it for you."
"00:28:06,455 --> 00:28:08,183","Schafer: Yeah. What if I get a bunch of ideas from him."
"00:28:08,183 --> 00:28:11,412","Might be bad."
"00:28:11,412 --> 00:28:14,859","People send me stuff as if I have time to read anything."
