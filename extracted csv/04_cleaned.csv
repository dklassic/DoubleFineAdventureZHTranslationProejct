"00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,328","Cambell: Hello? Schafer: Hello!"
"00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,796","Cambell: It's open."
"00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,015","Oh, god."
"00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:51,618","How many flights of these stairs are there?"
"00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,140","[Heavy breathing] [Coughs]"
"00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:04,831","[Gasping] So out of shape."
"00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,234","Gonna die."
"00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:15,360","[Deep breaths] [Knocking]"
"00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:24,284","[Wheezing] Cambell: Hi, dude. Schafer: Hi."
"00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,886","Scott Campbell. Cambell: You made it up the stairs."
"00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,188","Schafer: Do you wanna work on our adventure game?"
"00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,124","Cambell: Yes. Schafer: Okay."
"00:01:31,880 --> 00:02:04,291","[Music] Schafer: Ah, you wanna come to the stand up?"
"00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,625","Crook: Come and do our stand up. We're gonna have it right here."
"00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,060","Cambell: You guys stand up for the whole thing?"
"00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,395","Schafer: Come to our stand up. Cambell: Okay."
"00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,628","I kind of have to use the..."
"00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:10,796","you know... Schafer: Nope."
"00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,165","Cambell: ...you-know-what first. Schafer: Nope."
"00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,467","Oh yeah?"
"00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,701","We were doing stand ups when you were here."
"00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,136","Kipnis: Ah, Scott, holy shit."
"00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,038","Hey! Cambell: Hey!"
"00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:20,640","Kipnis: Hey! Cambell: How are you?"
"00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,376","Is this how you guys always do it, just standing in the middle?"
"00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:26,079","Schafer: You stand in the middle and then you close your eyes and you lean and we pass the body around."
"00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,382","Rice: Good, how's it goin'? Cambell: Good, man."
"00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,617","Schafer: You know Brandon? Dillon: No, we haven't met before."
"00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,754","Schafer: Brandon, Scott Campbell. Cambell: Hey man."
"00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:38,592","Skillman: Oh man, we're being filmed. Man, this is so awkward, but it's nice to see you."
"00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,660","McGarry: Oh, it's on camera. What's up, buddy?"
"00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,062","Good to see you."
"00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,664","Hackett: That's all we do around here is hug."
"00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,600","Cambell: Hey, buddy. Hug sounds good, man."
"00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,335","Muir: I never met Peter Chan in person."
"00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,470","McGarry: I never met him either. Crook: Really?"
"00:02:50,860 --> 00:03:07,554","[Murmuring] Schafer: Bap-bee-dee-bap-bup-ba-da, buh-bum, ba-da-dum-dum-dum."
"00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,223","Ya-da-za-ha."
"00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,527","Let's see, are we all here? Everyone here?"
"00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,429","Hello, hello, everybody."
"00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,197","Hi, thanks for coming."
"00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,600","Uh, please join me in welcoming some special guests we have here today."
"00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,803","We have from--some out-of-towners."
"00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:26,740","We have Mr. Peter Chan over here, Peter Chan."
"00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,308","Hello."
"00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:34,147","[applause] Uh, we have Mr. Scott Campbell. Where's Scott Campbell?"
"00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,149","There's Scott Campbell! Yay, Scott Campbell."
"00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,389","[Applause] And we have, uh, Nathan ""Bagel"" Stapley."
"00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,657","There he is."
"00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,295","[Applause] Anyone else coming in from out of town?"
"00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,796","Is anyone here? Great."
"00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:53,733","Um, we are doing, um, uh, an art jam for Reds."
"00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,869","Reds is the code name for our Double Fine Adventure."
"00:03:55,869 --> 00:04:01,475","This last week, we did one of my favorite things, which was the art jam, which we got all our artists from across the country"
"00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:08,048","here in this room sitting around one table just drawing and talking and pitching ideas back and forth."
"00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:13,019","And we had Peter Chan who has been working with me since ""Monkey Island 2."""
"00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,423","We have Scott Campbell, who's here since the beginning of Double Fine."
"00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:22,796","And Nathan ""Bagel"" Stapley, who, um, whose art is gonna be featured front and center"
"00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:28,502","in the Double Fine Adventure, and who has also been here since the beginning of Double Fine."
"00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:33,573","It's good to see you guys, I haven't seen, you know, a lot of you in the office for a while, so it's awesome to have you here."
"00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:38,345","Um, people who don't know who these guys are, ask somebody."
"00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:42,749","[Laughter] Cambell: You know, I'm excited. It's like a total reunion."
"00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:50,323","The last time we were all together was, um, beginning of ""Brütal Legend."" Peter was--Peter's been on, I think, every one of his projects."
"00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:54,494","Chan: Here that, uh, hired me. Right here."
"00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:58,064","Gilbert: I hired more people in this industry than you know."
"00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:03,203","Chan: Tim and everyone was going, ""We would like you to come back and help us out on this."""
"00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:07,374","And that was the friendliest you've seen Ron right there, fellas."
"00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:14,848","To collaborate with, uh, these guys Ron and Tim again is, you know, is like the good old days, you know?"
"00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,117","So I didn't want to pass that up."
"00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,085","Schafer: Art is obviously really critical to graphic adventures."
"00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:23,690","It's part of the defining thing of like, ""Let's have an adventure game, but let's add not just text to it."
"00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,528","Let's actually show the world."" And seeing beautiful worlds laid out in front of you"
"00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,330","that inspire your imagination."
"00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:36,069","Your desire to explore them is such an important thing, 'cause they don't have, um, you know,"
"00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:42,642","an RPG's progression drive, you know, or an addictive hook like collectables or something like that usually."
"00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:52,018","It's just the--the thing that pulls you forward and keeps you going is the-- the extent to which we've ignited your desire to explore."
"00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:57,824","So I was gonna go over the state of the game like storywise and what design there is on the game,"
"00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:04,297","and then talk about, uh, art jam, too, a little bit, 'cause this is a little-- this is a little earlier than I think we did--"
"00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:09,703","Like, when Peter--by the time Peter visited on ""Brütal,"" we already had a bunch of art that we then kind of bundled up"
"00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,338","and made the factions and stuff like that."
"00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,273","This is, I think, a little earlier in the process."
"00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:20,747","I was hoping to-- I asked Greg to kind of get you guys here as soon as possible to help generate ideas while I'm designing the game,"
"00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,316","'cause, um, the game could go so many different areas."
"00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:28,288","And I have this idea about the boy and the girl, but, you know, there's the spaceship, but there could be anything on the spaceship,"
"00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:36,296","and there's this pastoral world, but it could be any level of-- it could have anything in it right now, and I think a lot of these, I think coming up"
"00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:40,233","with just visual ideas for cool places to go are just as valid a place to start as anything."
"00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:48,875","Petty: This one is, we're at such an early state on, uh, Reds, that, um, you know, Tim-- Tim's only really identified"
"00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,144","a few very specific things for us."
"00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:55,181","Schafer: Right now, the green cards are characters-- these are the characters so far--"
"00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,584","and the yellow cards are just story points."
"00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:03,523","Um, I'm gonna be adding locations here and, um, puzzles in different colors."
"00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,525","I mean, I told them a lot about what we have."
"00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:12,299","That's really as far as the game has gone because, um, I've been doing a lot of business stuff, which is annoying."
"00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:16,336","Yeah, so I'm way behind on the design and the puzzles, but we did hire a business guy."
"00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:17,737","Rice: So that's good."
"00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,606","Schafer: Which means I won't have to work on Hausen anymore."
"00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:24,344","But luckily, we just hired a business guy to come in and take care of that stuff."
"00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:29,683","Trying to get Brad's new project signed, and, uh, there were a lot of meetings at E3 and stuff."
"00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:35,789","Um, you know, there's a few more details that only make sense to me, but, uh, um,"
"00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:41,094","I mostly gave those guys the heads up about where-- where everything is right now, yeah."
"00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:45,031","Uh, it's a story about a boy and a girl, and they both have two different parallel stories going on,"
"00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,434","and the player can jump back and forth between them."
"00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:54,007","And the girl is, um, a young girl who's been chosen for this big honor that she finds out is actually being sacrificed"
"00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,476","to a horrible monster in order to save her town."
"00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:02,282","And her story is about choosing to break out of that arrangement and endanger her town"
"00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,051","and hopefully fight the monster and save her town."
"00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:12,292","And then the boy is a, um-- has grown up alone on a spaceship, a giant, kind of organic spaceship"
"00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:17,597","that takes care of his every needs and creates entertainment for him and takes care of his food and his health and everything,"
"00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,733","but he's all by himself out in space."
"00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:24,804","And it's about him actually finding out, um, how to take control of that ship"
"00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:30,577","and get access to new secret areas and find out that he has the ability to actually, uh,"
"00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:33,545","have a higher purpose than just hanging out in this ship being entertained,"
"00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:37,583","but he can actually go on rescue missions and save helpless creatures around the galaxy."
"00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:44,056","Chan: Like all the other adventure games, I think he had more landmarks already established."
"00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,092","More tent poles, right?"
"00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:52,198","And, um, and then my job was to connect between them."
"00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:58,371","And this time around, yeah, there's less tent poles, and so it's our job to go in and try to figure out"
"00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,673","what the other places are right now."
"00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:08,481","Basically, all we're doing is giving him enough of inspiration for him to run with it."
"00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:15,288","Once he sees an image and his imagination starts, you know, uh, walking around in our drawings,"
"00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,358","he can then start to expand on that."
"00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,760","That's how it always works with Tim."
"00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,466","Petty: On a creative direction standpoint, you know, Tim--I think Tim fishes a lot, you know?"
"00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:32,372","And, um, he kind of gets these elements and then he makes unusual but cohesive connections"
"00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,007","between those elements, you know?"
"00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,509","And I think that this will help that process for him."
"00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:41,815","Other people maybe have-- have in mind a very specific mythology, and I think Tim's different in different games."
"00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:47,187","Like, I think ""Brütal Legend,"" you know, he had a very, like, ""It's a roadie in this heavy metal fantasy world,"
"00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:51,191","and it's based on the look of album covers,"" and Frazetta--some of the very early stuff."
"00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:57,297","A little more--a little more specific than some of this, but I think in the end, he just takes different ways to get there"
"00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:01,434","depending on what he feels the game needs or what the theme of the game is really about."
"00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:07,040","Schafer: But, um, it's still in the phase where just, like, everything is like, ""Yes, and that could be cool and this could be cool"
"00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,143","and this could be cool,"" and just like, coming up with tons of art."
"00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:14,614","That's my goal. All right?"
"00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:21,054","Petty: There's these big gaps in the first two acts past the intro, and that's where I think we can help Tim the most."
"00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:32,298","[Music] Schafer: It is--I'm joking, but it is like a dream team."
"00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,368","I mean, these are the best artists I know, and they're all here together."
"00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:49,716","[Music] Cambell: Man, these are a little dry, dude."
"00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,620","Chan: Who makes this? Petty: Copic."
"00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,590","These are Japanese markers and they're the best, because first, they got a square shape so they don't roll on your table."
"00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:02,362","Right, and they got nice-- nice medium-sized tip, a very nice chisel tip."
"00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:07,667","And they--and they really can lay it down, so all you do to refill it is you just pull this sucker off like that."
"00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,570","And you can buy just tip replacements, too."
"00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,473","-Yeah. -Oh yeah."
"00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:17,076","It's like, uh, I met some-- I met Chris."
"00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:20,246","Cambell: Like a steak--it's like a meat-- it's like a bacon steak root."
"00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,348","-Very nice. -One down."
"00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,517","Bagel: Yam. -Who else?"
"00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,852","Chan: So she starts exploring."
"00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:30,657","When she reaches, like, pathways which are made of twigs, all right?"
"00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,625","Schafer: Mm-hm. Chan: So there are some paths."
"00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:37,430","Once she's on it, she won't sink anymore, so that--that automatically guides her through."
"00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,199","Schafer: Textural. Chan: Now--awesome."
"00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:43,803","Petty: When he wasn't looking, or when they needed to operate the ship, they started to like fold back, and they have all these like,"
"00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:47,774","um, like A.M. clock radio innards, and the arms come out and they start doing stuff"
"00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,076","and he turns around and they're like back as a little bunny."
"00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:56,215","Cambell: So, like, these people would be cruisin' around on like combs and brushes, dude, and they'd be combing the land like farming."
"00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,652","So it'd be like farming style, but they'd be farming the trees and shit."
"00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,020","Schafer: Are they pulling out lice to eat or anything?"
"00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,555","Cambell: No, it'd just be really pretty."
"00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:08,428","That's the thing, they can be farming, harvesting all the bugs and shit, and then they could put it in their little harvester,"
"00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:13,466","but also making really cool shapes from the stuff that they create like that, you know what I mean?"
"00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,836","Chan: So, that's what we've got."
"00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:24,177","Bagel: Yeah, I think we're getting closer to-- I think we're just trying to figure out like a language because-- since these things are gonna be 2D painting,"
"00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:28,281","I think we really just have to figure out the language of both worlds."
"00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,450","And I think we're like getting..."
"00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,721","I think all these drawings, once we put them all up tomorrow and see what Tim says,"
"00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:39,425","it'll even be just that next level of direction, you know?"
"00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,128","Cambell: But he just gets worried when you throw away your drawings."
"00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:48,267","I don't know if you saw that today, but we had some--some run-ins with some of the artists throwing away their work"
"00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,470","'cause they don't think it's good enough."
"00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,606","Schafer: Don't let me bother you, I'm just looking at what you're drawing."
"00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,874","Those are pretty."
"00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:58,244","Where'd that squid go? Bagel: Squid?"
"00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,445","Petty: You were painting a squid earlier."
"00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,780","Bagel: Oh yeah, I threw it out, I threw it away."
"00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,181","Schafer: You threw it out? Petty: Oh!"
"00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,383","Schafer: You son of a-- Petty: We all liked it."
"00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,584","Cambell: Why'd you throw that away, dude?"
"00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,152","Bagel: Son of a monkey. Which one?"
"00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,322","Petty: Get a whole sheet. Schafer: Oh my God, and you tore it in half?"
"00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,491","Bagel: I can make another one."
"00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,759","Bagel: We'll make another one."
"00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,027","Cambell: Dude, that whole fuckin' page."
"00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,295","Bagel: You guys liked it?"
"00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,196","Schafer: Yeah, we paid for that, we paid for that."
"00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,399","You pretty much just stole from the backers by tearing that up."
"00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,101","Bagel: Yeah. Cambell: Why'd you rip that up?"
"00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,836","-You crazy, man? Bagel: I know."
"00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,805","Cambell: That was the best shit, man."
"00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:30,009","Bagel: Now, uh-- I didn't think it was that great."
"00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:34,480","Yeah, he picked it out of the trash, my drawing."
"00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,150","And then he told me to do it over again."
"00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,484","Cambell: He'll probably Frankenstein that one and that'll be the..."
"00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,154","Bagel: Oh, speak of the devil. Cambell: ...the biggest idea."
"00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,658","Schafer: You guys talking about something?"
"00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,193","That's cool."
"00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,462","Weird porcupine guys."
"00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,464","Bagel: It's like moving, uh, on land. Schafer: That's awesome."
"00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:55,768","Chan: I have a lot of faith in Tim, and all we have to do is plant a few seeds"
"00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,137","and he'll start running with it, right?"
"00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,772","Cambell: Yeah, planting seeds."
"00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,675","Yeah, you don't know what seeds will turn into rad stuff, man."
"00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:24,664","[Music] Cambell: So it's just a list of possible room ideas and experiences, you know?"
"00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,200","Just kind of--like, some of them are just words."
"00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,103","They may make us think about some interesting things, you know?"
"00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,405","Like wild jungle. It's fun for people."
"00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:39,078","A sunny beach, candy room, garden zone for, like, the tender side of boys."
"00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,817","[Laughing] Maybe those seeds will grow into amazing things"
"00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,554","and then we'll realize that those amazing things are actually terrible."
"00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,458","So we'll just cover them up with a sheet and then move on to the next thing."
"00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,293","Who knows?"
"00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:58,598","You know, fireball, soccer, playin' with fireballs are really fun, probably, for boys."
"00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:02,735","Laser zone--anything can be made into lasers, so you can eat sandwiches of lasers,"
"00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,272","you could just shoot 'em, ride 'em, dodge 'em. You know."
"00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,142","I'll just do drawings and try to get people pumped."
"00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,444","It's my--That'll be my role."
"00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:16,282","So this is like, just, could be waterfalls and different things of goop, and it could be falling down,"
"00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,884","or this could be barf, you know?"
"00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:23,256","And it could be like animal, or, you know, creatures made of barf kind of unhappy or happy, you know?"
"00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,224","Like, and they can be barfing new creatures."
"00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:28,194","It could just be barf zone, you know what I mean?"
"00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:31,030","Schafer: Was there a period in your life where you had a barf thing?"
"00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,465","Cambell: People love barf, dude."
"00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,567","Schafer: Oh, no, they don't."
"00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,703","Cambell: At this point, everything is disposable and stuff, so."
"00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:43,876","That's the thing about creative processes, like, you wanna go down every road fully"
"00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,511","to realize that road is wrong."
"00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:50,750","You can't just go down a little bit and be, ""Ooh, uh..."" You gotta really test that water fully"
"00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,618","before you can realize that's a terrible road."
"00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,421","And then you go down the next road."
"00:15:55,421 --> 00:16:01,394","Rice: This is a list of locations from our backers on the forums."
"00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:06,032","Petty: You know, some of the stuff, we're just incorporating backer-- uh, backer ideas, which was cool."
"00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:09,335","You know, but they don't really know anything about the story, which is kind of cool at this phase, right,"
"00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:13,339","that they don't really have to, that maybe some of those things will wind up working in ways."
"00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,374","Rice: I went through the first ten pages so far."
"00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,676","Schafer: Oh my God, how many pages are there?"
"00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,878","Rice: I know, there's 38 or something like that."
"00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,346","Um, we're still in girl world."
"00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,014","Sand castle world?"
"00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,115","That's a new one. Bagel: Sand castles."
"00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,617","Rice: Sand castle world."
"00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,118","Boy world."
"00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:29,388","A haunted lighthouse on the moon."
"00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,090","Schafer: What? Bagel: I didn't see that moon comin'."
"00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:37,530","Rice: Um, this dude says, ""Inside of a computer."" This dude says, ""An entire city made of blanket forts."""
"00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,832","That was something. Cambell: Yeah."
"00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:44,070","Rice: MS-DOS world, where everything's made from words."
"00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,172","Schafer: That's a text adventure, that's called a text adventure."
"00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:52,645","Rice: ""It is a place where you play connect-the-dots to build the location."" Cambell: Fuckin' creative people, dude."
"00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,180","Rice: Yeah. Cambell: It's okay if we use that shit?"
"00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,581","I mean, dude, we're gonna get..."
"00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,517","Schafer: Yeah. Cambell: ...sued."
"00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,320","Seriously, man, fuck, like, I'm so excited to see these lists."
"00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,991","I feel like--I feel like it's cheating, kind of."
"00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:07,792","Bagel: It's like, uh, they're stoked."
"00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:11,162","Like, if somebody gets their idea made, like, that'd be awesome."
"00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:20,238","Cambell: And there's all these sequels based on that one idea that someone said, then they're gonna start being like, ""Hm, maybe I should have held onto that idea."""
"00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,407","Schafer: The hair trees, wanna mention that."
"00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:27,346","I love all these guys and that whole story, like, whatever-- I don't even know what it is yet, but like,"
"00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,250","the idea of going into this, like, grass-covered thing that comes to life."
"00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,621","And this behavior is really cool, it's just like, there's something lazy about it that I like."
"00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,623","Cambell: We've just been trying to get as much stuff as we can."
"00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:41,594","All right, with the big--I just think it's a round hunchback of forest right here."
"00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:44,230","Schafer: It's kind of like those, uh, you know, those places in New Mexico or..."
"00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:50,436","Cambell: We're not getting too into the mechanics of how the ship creates things or how the monster land looks or how the city looks,"
"00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:55,841","but just kind of overall things that might spark stuff for him right now."
"00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,843","So we'll just do more of that tomorrow."
"00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:29,141","[Music] Chan: I just, uh, did a lot of drawing on my own,"
"00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,010","you know, self-taught."
"00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:37,016","I would draw--when I was little, I would draw on paper, and then, if I didn't like something,"
"00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,185","I would crumple it up and throw it away."
"00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:48,461","And I remember my father said to me, um, ""Now, if you-- if you just slide your drawings into the garbage can,"
"00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:54,467","and without crumpling it-- without crumpling it up, you would fit more drawings in the, um, garbage bin,"""
"00:18:54,467 --> 00:19:03,075","not knowing that he was going through it later, um, and pulling out the ones he liked, because, um, after he passed away,"
"00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:09,548","I found a folder that was labeled, uh, ""Peter,"" and I found my old Star Wars drawings."
"00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:18,157","Uh, if he didn't do that, I wouldn't have any drawings, because I don't-- I don't really keep my--my stuff around."
"00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:35,274","[Music] As you can see, uh, I tucked in the woods here,"
"00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:40,880","and this is where I get my inspiration, is, uh, nature."
"00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:50,656","Um, so, as you know, uh, you're on San Juan Island, and, uh, this is my little studio away from my home,"
"00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:55,995","and this is where I create, uh, drawings for games and films."
"00:19:55,995 --> 00:20:02,702","I'm, uh, in here eight hours a day, and what's nice is on a beautiful day like today,"
"00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:07,440","I--I, uh, I like to draw outside when I can."
"00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,611","When I'm having a creative block, that's the time to go out, you know, go on walks and hikes,"
"00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:16,415","and that's important to be creative, too."
"00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:20,886","I need to create that space to think."
"00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,855","I love it, can't go back."
"00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:34,366","This fits and feels really, really good for my creative self and for my emotional self and everything else."
"00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,801","It's really good."
"00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:42,408","""Grim"" actually was my last adventure game, and it was the-- and it was done here on the island."
"00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:47,279","It was my first job away from Lucas."
"00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:55,287","This was my goin' away present, uh, from Lucas, as you can see."
"00:20:55,287 --> 00:21:00,659","Never forget where you started, where you come from, and that's something really important to me."
"00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:05,264","'Cause that's why, um, I have, like, some Star Wars stuff in here."
"00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:10,136","It's important that I have a few of those things around because that's what inspired me."
"00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:11,670","That's what got me started."
"00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:17,877","That's why this piece here, by Ralph McQuarrie, is so important to me,"
"00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:24,750","'Cause he's the man that, um, inspired me to do what I'm doing now."
"00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:30,122","When I was ten, I didn't know that there was such thing as, a, you know, concept designer,"
"00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:35,461","someone that actually designs something for you to live in for those couple hours,"
"00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:40,332","if it was a movie, or--or now, hours playing video games."
"00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:45,037","I mean, it's a--an opportunity to escape and live in that world."
"00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,139","This is where I draw, mostly."
"00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:53,212","I do everything standing up, and I still draw on paper, as you can see."
"00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:58,284","Down here is, uh, all the bad ideas right here."
"00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:01,020","See, these are the workups."
"00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:10,196","From this came this one, where it's-- as you can see, is a total mess, and, uh, I try to come up with, uh, some funny ideas,"
"00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:13,432","and then from there, becomes this one up here."
"00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:20,773","And then eventually, I use all those drawings, um, to start my fire in the morning."
"00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,212","It's a good lesson on letting go."
"00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:38,490","[Music] I'm gonna show you guys something."
"00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:49,235","These are my family photo albums of when Tim and Pete Tscale came to visit,"
"00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:58,110","and, uh, used to do work jams on the island with me at the, uh, farmhouse."
"00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:04,416","That's, uh, me in my upstairs loft studio out of-- in the farmhouse."
"00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:11,257","And those are all the storyboards for ""Grim Fandango."" And here's me drawing."
"00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:18,330","I don't remember, but Tim swears that I was drawing so fast I was shooting the little ball tips out."
"00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:22,134","Is he gonna kill me? I gotta show you this."
"00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:26,038","I'm not gonna show you the second one, 'cause I know he'll kill me for sure,"
"00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:30,542","but I'm gonna give you this one because he looks so good in it."
"00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,412","Tim chopping wood."
"00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,183","And I'm not gonna show you the second one."
"00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:42,988","That's a before, and then this one's after."
"00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:50,729","""Grim"" is my favorite, um, adventure game that I've ever worked on."
"00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:55,267","But who knows, this could be the next favorite game."
"00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:59,838","When I start a project, I start collecting my books."
"00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:05,544","It's important to go and do your research, do it the old-fashioned way first."
"00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:14,186","And I learn more by going to the library and reading up on it instead of just looking for a pretty picture off the internet."
"00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:20,059","And so for us to create our own village, I think it's important that we, um,"
"00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:26,165","try to find that happy balance between what we're familiar with as fairytale--"
"00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:30,502","the signature shape is, like, mushrooms, for, like, Alice in Wonderland--"
"00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:35,074","and you balance it with something foreign, something that we're not familiar with."
"00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:40,813","In Japanese architecture, you can kind of see there's mushrooms in it without even thinking about it."
"00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:47,586","There are these great mushroom shapes that are happening, and so I thought I'd mix that up with,"
"00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:55,294","um, Scandinavian, like country homes, and that brings in some of the really cute stuff"
"00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:58,464","that's happening, see, with the thatched roofing."
"00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:04,002","Here you can kind of see that my wood-burning stove that I put in the background here"
"00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:08,741","looks like one of these lanterns."
"00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:12,144","It has, like, the mushroom top."
"00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:21,820","And so, I'm just figuring that out right now, and then eventually have to pitch this to, um, Tim and Lee,"
"00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,658","and hopefully sell them the ideas that I have."
"00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:31,063","Um, yeah, I can't wait."
"00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:38,137","And then what's nice, though, is that I'm able to shut that door at the end of the day and walk across the lawn and go home,"
"00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:45,611","and I leave, uh, this game in the studio and it doesn't follow me-- follow me home,"
"00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:51,316","because my life at home is important."
"00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:57,156","And, uh, and actually, you know, we should get out of here and spend some time outside."
"00:25:57,156 --> 00:26:00,492","That's where some of the better ideas come from."
"00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:31,657","[Music] Cambell: My name's Scott Campbell and I live here in New York City."
"00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:34,593","We are in my apartment, which also is my studio."
"00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:42,868","I'm an illustrator and I've worked at Double Fine, uh-- I think I was employee number six in 2001,"
"00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:47,206","and I was art director on ""Psychonauts"" and ""Brütal Legend."""
"00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:50,442","Production designer for ""Brütal Legend,"" my official title."
"00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:56,315","When I was working at the studio, like, I liked to go into his office and just kind of show him,"
"00:26:56,315 --> 00:27:01,620","like, uh, the paintings and drawings and stuff, and I would be able to gauge from his--"
"00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,388","his reaction whether or not it was good."
"00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,858","That's what I miss living here in New York."
"00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:12,197","One thing I know that Tim likes, though-- he likes drawings when they're in cool poses."
"00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:15,767","Even if the designs aren't very good, he just likes poses."
"00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:21,273","So if there's a dude that I really like the design of, I'll put him in the coolest pose and hope that he digs it."
"00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:26,245","It was one of my favorite poses is putting his-- putting your feet up on something."
"00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:30,082","Always sell Tim on this pose."
"00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:34,019","I haven't talked to Tim since the very beginning, so I don't know how it's evolved, you know?"
"00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:38,190","Just when Tim first pitched the game to Bagel and I, he came here to New York."
"00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:43,195","We had some, uh, some sangria and some tacos and we talked about it and he gave us the pitch."
"00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:48,267","And so after that, you know, Bagel--Bagel and I just kind of started just gathering our friends"
"00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:53,172","and just trying out drawing the main two characters and some basic environment ideas."
"00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:57,276","Pre-production is like when you get started and you start dream-- dream the dreams, you know?"
"00:27:57,276 --> 00:28:01,046","It can be anything you want and stuff, and you're just kind of gathering inspiration."
"00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:06,718","Gathering reference is like-- it's like my favorite part, so I'm constantly taking stuff from the internet,"
"00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,554","like gathering images and stuff."
"00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:13,825","It's just like if ever I hit-- if ever I see something cool, I'll just kind of take it and put it in a folder for later."
"00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:18,697","Just like kind of the effects or the colors, I don't know what it would inspire, but it just makes me feel pretty good."
"00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,166","I just think that's an odd scene."
"00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:25,270","This is a nice soft picture of a lady that makes me feel pretty good."
"00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,039","I don't know what these are gonna inspire at all, you guys."
"00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,476","I--I do all the drawings like kind of this just on pieces of paper like this."
"00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:37,015","I just draw on Xerox paper and stuff, and I, like, I just scan 'em in and kind of make 'em"
"00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,384","look better later, pretty much, so."
"00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:44,122","It's easy for me to kind of like chill out in the morning in a café and do drawings like that,"
"00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:49,461","and then kind of like worry about, you know, just so I could kind of-- any way that I kind of relax"
"00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:55,133","and kind of loosen up and stuff like that, and I find that if I'm not near a computer, I'm most relaxed."
"00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,235","This is my little drawing zone."
"00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:02,441","See, I print out a lot of my-- a lot of my reference and kind of mood boards."
"00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:05,644","So I have this up and I'm constantly kind of changing it out."
"00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:09,147","You know, update it, and with new things, make me feel different ways, so."
"00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,782","So here are some paintings."
"00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:17,322","So I painted these girls from-- these are from the game, and so I just print out-- print them out,"
"00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:23,195","and then just kind of trace 'em onto the paper, and then start--start water coloring like that."
"00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,663","This could be the girl, you guys."
"00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:28,433","This could be the-- this could be the--the drawing."
"00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,236","So let's see what happens together, shall we?"
"00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,138","I'm gonna give her this little dress here."
"00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,374","I'm not exactly sure what that's made of."
"00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:38,343","Noodle arms. Well, it doesn't really look like noodle arms."
"00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,178","Okay, there she is."
"00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,314","That's one version."
"00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:45,284","Maybe she has a little buddy, her magical buddy."
"00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,219","We'll see. There you go."
"00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,087","This is, uh, concept art."
"00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:54,059","That's--that's how it works."
"00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,528","That's how magic works."
"00:29:56,528 --> 00:30:02,134","Oh, here's a painting that Bagel did of Obama a long time ago."
"00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,669","Bagel and I are really tight bros."
"00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:08,607","I moved here, um, about four years ago, and he moved here like a month after."
"00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:14,212","He stayed with our other friend, and then he would just work out of my house 'cause we were still workin' for Double Fine out of my house."
"00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:17,449","And then he just was always over here, so he just found a place over here."
"00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,017","Yeah, he's super close."
"00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,453","I mean, we can just walk there right now even."
"00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:24,322","[Offscreen] Okay, and then we cut to us over there."
"00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,524","Okay, cool."
"00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,798","Cambell: That's his window up there."
"00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:35,100","Bagel!"
"00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,237","Hey, bro. Bagel: Hey, buddy!"
"00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,373","It's a little tight, sorry, guys."
"00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:45,077","I was gonna try to clean all this stuff up, but I didn't."
"00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:46,344","Cambell: That's okay, man."
"00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:52,784","Bagel: This is my bedroom here and my studio where I paint and where I sleep."
"00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,487","There's my bed, there's my bathroom."
"00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,255","It's pretty amazing."
"00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,057","Um, it's clean."
"00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,827","And this is my kitchen."
"00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:05,230","This is my view, the projects."
"00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,367","And this is like this butcher paper that I had that I imagined I was gonna, like, draw all over,"
"00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,269","but that's about as far as I've gotten."
"00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:14,606","But if I ever want to draw on the wall, I could do it."
"00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,509","Painting, I do it--I usually just stick a canvas on the wall."
"00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:22,314","You could see, like, all these paint marks like underneath that map."
"00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:25,984","I just like tack up a canvas on the wall and start paintin' on it, usually."
"00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,652","Yeah, no easel."
"00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:33,225","So I'm just in the sketching phase kind of now, and I do that all right here on the computer."
"00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,994","I have, like, one show a year that's kind of like my sketch."
"00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:39,397","I just work--do work stuff and then have, like, a solo show."
"00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:44,603","That's the--how it's been goin' the last, like, three years, so I just have like one big show to worry about a year."
"00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:47,739","Some stuff I had in the show last year."
"00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:52,077","18 Dads, it's a bunch of dads."
"00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,545","This is just random pieces of paper."
"00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:56,448","This is like how I organize myself, I guess."
"00:31:56,448 --> 00:32:02,187","These are just studies, like color studies, like N.C. Wyeth and, uh, that's the illustrator that I like."
"00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:03,655","Just weird doodles."
"00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:08,293","First kind of color sketch of that thing, yeah."
"00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:11,263","Tim hadn't even really talked about the idea that he had yet."
"00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:15,767","I would just kind of throw things at him every week, and sometimes he would say that he liked little things"
"00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,371","or he would just grab onto something and then I would take it, or, you know,"
"00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:22,441","just kind of push things or try other things out."
"00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:28,046","And so, um, I worked out this kind of story about this weird lumberjack and a bear."
"00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:35,120","Like he washes up on this mysterious island, and it's like a magical island in some huge lake"
"00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,555","in the Pacific Northwest."
"00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:39,825","This is kind of where the prototype started."
"00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:44,429","Yeah, I had an idea that this, like, caveman got unfrozen with this dinosaur and they ended up, like,"
"00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,498","in the--what was it, like, Virginia?"
"00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,333","The mountains of Virginia and stuff?"
"00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:56,007","And it--it was gonna be all like, uh, bluegrass soundtrack, fish-out-of-water style, and then they would, like,"
"00:32:56,007 --> 00:33:00,479","all play music together or something, but I don't think that's gonna happen."
"00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:04,115","This is where that lumberjack dude is right now."
"00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:09,254","He's gonna be a puppet, so we're, like, separating all of his limbs."
"00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:10,722","I gotta cut him all up."
"00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:18,430","You know, break him up into kind of joints, but really simple puppet-style, so, you know, at the knees, at the elbows, and puppetize him"
"00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,632","for Ray to start animating this week."
"00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:24,769","You know, in between these rotating poses, he can, you know, supposedly make him look"
"00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,671","like he's going back and forth."
"00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:33,645","So I gotta like paint what's gonna be behind the arms, but he's gonna move it around, so you gotta see what's behind here."
"00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:39,217","Uh, this game is gonna be so totally different and new, so who knows, you know?"
"00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:43,788","It's gonna be exciting when we start getting into like, uh, the real deal."
"00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,324","I'm lookin' forward to that, it's gonna be awesome."
"00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,093","Schafer: I've always loved Bagel's paintings."
"00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:55,133","He's, um, when he does his fine art shows and galleries, he does these crazy works that are somewhat surreal,"
"00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:59,771","you know, playing with scale and playing with a mix of cartoony and, like, realism."
"00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:04,709","He can do realistic stuff really well, mixes it with cartoony stuff and otherworldly type landscapes,"
"00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:10,447","and I think--I wanna do a whole game that'll look like those landscapes and with those strange characters."
"00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:12,149","Bagel: Check it out."
"00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,286","Franzke: It takes a while to actually be responsive, for some reason."
"00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,121","Bagel: No way!"
"00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,290","Man, that looks so cool on the iPad."
"00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,456","Rice: Isn't that awesome?"
"00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:21,225","Schafer: Did you see that?"
"00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,194","Bagel: Is it like a touch and then he walks toward your finger?"
"00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,462","Rice: Just touch down."
"00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,464","You have to be in the foreground."
"00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,766","Schafer: We can't go in the back with all the layers yet?"
"00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,701","Oliver: Not right now, not this version."
"00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:31,303","Rice: But you can walk around."
"00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,637","Bagel: It's insane."
"00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:38,176","Schafer: It makes me so happy 'cause it's on an iPad and it looks pretty."
"00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:41,780","In the end, all the art will go through Nathan, as he paints the final stuff."
"00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:45,283","So it's all gonna look like his style, so it'll all be unified."
"00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:50,188","You're just gonna see his take on the other artists' ideas and drawings."
"00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:54,491","This'll be more than any game we've done before, like, uh, in the end, you know,"
"00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:57,027","a game where Bagel really gets to shine."
"00:34:57,027 --> 00:35:00,365","Bagel: Yeah, I mean, I guess, I mean, and theoretically, he should be darker, like, you know?"
"00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:02,200","I think he's too light right now."
"00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,304","Like, he should blend--the colors, I think, should blend more with the environment."
"00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:09,641","But, um, that's--that-- it's just not in yet."
"00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,343","It's, uh..."
"00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:16,681","Lee's gonna do some effects and aftereffects, I think, that lights the character's texture,"
"00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,317","so he would be a lot more blue and dark in this one."
"00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,054","Nice."
"00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,192","Killer."
"00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:31,329","I feel pretty awesome about it, I think."
"00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,098","I feel great about everything."
"00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:38,036","Uh, yeah, I think--it's--I'm, like, interested to see how it's gonna go, you know?"
"00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:41,373","Like I hope those guys don't hate my paintings of their paintings."
"00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:45,610","You know, it's awesome 'cause they're just gonna be in a sweet painting world."
"00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:52,317","Like, that's-- that gets me pumped that people are gonna be able to, like, explore my paintings, you know?"
"00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,689","Rice: That's hilarious."
"00:35:57,689 --> 00:36:02,394","Bagel: That's amazing, though, dude. Rice: Oh, man, that's super good."
"00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:08,466","Crook: So I'm actually scaling the arms a little bit so that it feels like they go-- Yeah, they get a little bit of perspective."
"00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:09,801","And the feet. Rice: Yeah."
"00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:13,104","Bagel: That totally, uh, that totally works."
"00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:18,143","Petty: It's weird, it's a hybrid process 'cause it's like you're doing a 2D painting, but then we do have to get it on a 3D geometry,"
"00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:22,747","so it has some of the cleanup work as if it were a real 3D-- like a full 3D model."
"00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:29,821","Bagel: It depends on how complicated we're gonna get with all the parallaxing and, you know, I have never had to worry about memory issues"
"00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:38,463","in painting and restrictions, you know, technical restrictions or anything like that, so, yeah,"
"00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:42,667","I mean, it's really, like, gonna be a crazy learning process at the same time, you know?"
"00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:52,310","Yeah, putting it all together and makin' it into a working, functional, moving world is, like, I haven't really done that before, so this is a whole--a whole new world."
"00:36:52,310 --> 00:37:00,151","If I were to say, like, ""Ah, here's this-- here's, like, him the most lit he's gonna be."" Uh, you know, ""Here's him dark as he's gonna be,"""
"00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:03,354","and then, like, you're--okay-- Petty: But I think it solves a different problem, right?"
"00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:07,792","We're talking about-- like, I think the general color gradients, I think, look good."
"00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,994","I think the rim lighting is a different thing."
"00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:14,999","That's not about lighting as much as it is, like, when there's an intense light source around."
"00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,570","It's about just putting a little bit on there to, like, tie him into the scene."
"00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,740","I think, I mean, you read the comments at the forum, and like everyone found it very appealing."
"00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,409","It really helped the tie-in. Bagel: Yeah?"
"00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,312","Schafer: Yeah, Bagel is not, um, really, you know, technical."
"00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,013","He likes to paint."
"00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:40,058","He likes to paint on, you know, canvas and paper, and, uh, um, and that's why it's really invaluable to have someone like Lee Petty on the team who can bridge that gap."
"00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:46,498","He's a fine artist himself, he can draw, he can paint, but he also knows how to use, um, incredibly advanced,"
"00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:52,137","you know, techniques and 3D rendering, and, you know, just making games that, you know, a lot of programmers, you know,"
"00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:56,508","he can match programmers sometimes with the knowledge of, um..."
"00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,443","He's got a lot of knowledge. That's what I'm trying to say."
"00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:01,513","So it's great to have someone like Lee around who can bridge that gap."
"00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:05,049","Petty: That's why I was saying earlier, don't paint the character dark because you can never get lighter."
"00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:08,119","We want to generally paint him pretty light like this 'cause then he can get darker."
"00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:14,826","Schafer: If you can span both worlds, it's really essential, 'cause you can work with a great artist, but then if that doesn't really translate into the game,"
"00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:18,830","you can be, um, it's just a waste."
"00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:24,636","Chan: Yeah, I'm--I'm curious as much as you are, and I have faith that it'll work."
"00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:33,077","I mean, Tim--see, that's the thing is like, Tim says, ""This is what I--I want to showcase Bagel's style."""
"00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:36,347","Perfect. I think that's a great idea."
"00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,317","And so I trust him."
"00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,720","If that's what he wants, then-- then there's something there."
"00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,024","Bagel: Ooh!"
"00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:47,392","Petty: All right, Ray. Crook: Go back to your jam."
"00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:48,827","Petty: All right. Bagel: Jam out."
"00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,028","Crook: All right, guys."
"00:38:50,580 --> 00:39:40,011","[Music] Schafer: You know, very early on, I sometimes have"
"00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,614","these stress nightmares about the game not existing yet."
"00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:49,420","I used to have these nightmares about levels in ""Psychonauts"" that didn't exist yet, and like, I was floating in the undesigned world"
"00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,855","and couldn't grab onto anything."
"00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:56,227","It's just like, it's the stress of things that you haven't really pulled together yet."
"00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:00,164","And these are like little life preservers and the-- floating in the ocean, like, you grab onto them like,"
"00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:07,105","""Ah, ah, now I can breathe and, like, look around and see what else I can pull together to make a raft out of,"" you know?"
"00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,139","That's a metaphor."
"00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,608","I like how it's like lighthouse with the haunted house on top of it."
"00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:13,645","Petty: Yeah, it's basic-- Chan: I can go home now? Schafer: What?"
"00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,146","Petty: Peter Chan. Bagel: Thank you."
"00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,016","Schafer: Peter Chan, yeah, Peter Chan."
"00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,451","Oh, Bagel's posting! Bagel, Bagel."
"00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,487","Chan: Bagel!"
"00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:23,621","Bagel: Yeah. Chan: Yeah."
"00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:24,789","Bagel: Jump in there."
"00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,525","Schafer: Bagel."
"00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:30,561","Okay. Bagel: Floating island maybe that-- Schafer: What's on the floating island?"
"00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,330","What are all these guys jumping off?"
"00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,866","Penguins? Bagel: Maybe they're loomin' outside the bushes."
"00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,135","Cambell: You should scan those in. Schafer: Crazy imagination."
"00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:39,037","Bagel: Yep, crazy imagination."
"00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:42,240","Schafer: Bradbury early folklore-- Mars folklore."
"00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,609","Ooh, I like Mars folklore. Bagel: Mars folklore."
"00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,544","Yeah, okay, bros, I'm out of here."
"00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:47,645","Schafer: Aw!"
"00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,148","Cambell: What?"
"00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:52,083","Schafer: Aw, why?"
"00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,285","Thank you for comin'. Cambell: See you, buddy."
"00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,687","Bagel: All right."
"00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:56,988","Bye, bros."
"00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:59,691","-All right, buddies. [Offscreen] Bye, Bagel!"
"00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:02,493","Chan: Well, I came over to say goodbye."
"00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,462","Schafer: Next time, we come up to you."
"00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,165","Chan: Yeah. Schafer: It's gonna be awesome."
"00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:08,766","Oh, Jesus."
"00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,803","Chan: I know."
"00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:23,480","[Laughter] [Music]"
"00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:30,021","Schafer: These are just some, uh, see, Scott is doing some crazy people, which I like."
"00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:33,825","And Lee did some crazy monsters, which I love those, too."
"00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,526","This guy's too young, that's wrong."
"00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:36,761","I love that one."
"00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:38,663","Those are freaking me out."
"00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,199","Um, I don't know what that is."
"00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,202","The Jedi robe."
"00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:45,403","I don't know about the Jedi robe."
"00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:46,671","Some monsters."
"00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,339","That is a really scary monster."
"00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:52,777","I think his little--ugh-- little things up front."
"00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:59,550","And Bagel did this one and it's like a mountain that looks like a wig."
"00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,352","It's like wig mountain."
"00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,154","And that's like a ship, I think."
"00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,989","And these are waves floating."
"00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,258","Little mushroom guy, which I love."
"00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,426","I love these paintings."
"00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,361","They're so tiny."
"00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,196","Sacrificial altars."
"00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:17,435","Here's another vision of the girl's village, really happy and cheerful looking, which I like."
"00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:19,203","This is crazy."
"00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:24,575","It's like a, um... I don't know what that is."
"00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,411","God's eye, we just had that idea today."
"00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,279","That one's gonna work, I think."
"00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,549","This is such a great stage in the project 'cause everything's been, like, in my head"
"00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:38,356","and the people's heads and in my notebook, and now it's just exploded out on the wall for everyone to see."
"00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:39,757","Everyone."
"00:42:40,080 --> 00:43:17,580","[Music]"
