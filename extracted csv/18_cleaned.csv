"00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:35,924","Ray: It'll be all right, Tim."
"00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:37,084","Hansen: It's all right. We'll figure this out."
"00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:40,648","Tim: Are you saying I shouldn't do it?"
"00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:42,242","Hansen: Don't do it. Don't do it."
"00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,603","Ray: We'll make it work."
"00:00:43,603 --> 00:00:47,414","Tim: You're just mad because if I did this it would not solve the problem for you guys."
"00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,811","Hansen: It just makes it worse actually. Ray: Yeah."
"00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:52,135","Hansen: That's right. It makes it easier for you."
"00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:56,555","Ray: There're still pickup lines that haven't been written, aren't there?"
"00:00:57,506 --> 00:01:26,207","[Music] Tim: I really am trying everything to make sure the game comes out this year."
"00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:28,767","Ray: December. What are we in, October, November?"
"00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:30,083","Yeah, I know that's not gonna happen."
"00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,013","Tim: I gotta finish."
"00:01:31,013 --> 00:01:35,740","I'm so close to being done with the dialogue for the game which would be a huge milestone in my life"
"00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:37,868","because all I can think about is the dialogue for this game."
"00:01:37,868 --> 00:01:38,937","There's a lot of dialogue in this game."
"00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,740","Okay, we're gonna start."
"00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,800","Weeklies, here we are, back on the project."
"00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,492","Hey, guess what. I finished all the dialogue for the game."
"00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,260","It's awesome. Yay!"
"00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,572","[Clapping] That's a relief."
"00:01:50,572 --> 00:01:51,272","Crook: Finally."
"00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,795","Schafer: Well, I mean you didn't have to put it that way, but yeah, yeah, finally."
"00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:54,875","Crook: Someone had to say it!"
"00:01:57,133 --> 00:02:01,736","I know I was going on my calendar today and there's a big recurring appointment for Reds writing and I went and I deleted it."
"00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:04,125","Oh, my God, this is exciting."
"00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,299","I'm never gonna write again."
"00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,079","Never write again. Never write again."
"00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,678","So actually I'm playing through the game right now and I'm making notes of what dialogue I need to write."
"00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,420","Other than that I'm totally done."
"00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:24,105","[Music] And then Tim nobly finished the last of the dialogue"
"00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:27,085","and everyone was happy forever, the end."
"00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:30,305","And that's the end of that chapter."
"00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,480","Does anybody have any questions?"
"00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,017","Broken Age, broken Age."
"00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:41,757","That's our rousing chant, broken age."
"00:02:42,982 --> 00:02:43,782","Bye."
"00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:45,677","Peck: What's new, man?"
"00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,417","We have gotten a butt ton of writing from Tim."
"00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:52,099","Crook: It's really good writing."
"00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:56,950","And the performances that we've gotten back are really good and so that kind of puts the pressure on you"
"00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:03,310","as an animator that you want to do that writing and those performances justice."
"00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:07,366","So that's, that's pressure, but good pressure."
"00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:09,106","It feels like things are moving smoothly."
"00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,115","It feels that way."
"00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:15,150","Anna: We're like finishing in record time."
"00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,770","We're actually ahead of schedule in a lot of ways which is like, you know, pretty rare for us because usually we're pretty slammed."
"00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:27,932","Lee: Yes, I can show you some mockups that we're working on in Vella, yeah, yeah."
"00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:30,217","This scene here is where Vella starts."
"00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:37,247","Players have already seen this, you know, the split screen at the very end of the game, and this is kind of what that scene continues as."
"00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:41,312","And then this is the first puzzle you see here is her skill here."
"00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:49,115","So this is a fairly elaborate puzzle that the player has to hit, and so a lot of this is just breakdowns of how it all works."
"00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:52,548","So we have the Hex Pals are returning."
"00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:56,628","Of course. I love the Hex Pals so I'm hoping to do more with them this time."
"00:03:56,628 --> 00:04:02,637","I think the Hex Pals and the Spoon, that stuff was all the big hits, like the surprise, like everyone loved these little side characters."
"00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:08,252","We have now heard a lot more feedback on that first act than you ever would if you were just gonna release it at once"
"00:04:08,252 --> 00:04:10,678","because it's been out in the wild and people have lived with it."
"00:04:10,678 --> 00:04:14,239","We've lived it for a while so we have more perspective on it."
"00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:21,767","Maybe that means the choices we're making for Act 2 are just a little bit better formed than they would've been if it was just,"
"00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:23,469","you know, one big push."
"00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:28,203","And then just a lot of scenes in Act 2, I can walk you around some of those if you want to see."
"00:04:28,203 --> 00:04:30,488","I can show you some with the spaceship stuff."
"00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:38,069","So we've tried to go through and make it look like you're driving by the countryside and damage some of the rooms."
"00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,788","Schafer: Exciting, really going places."
"00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:41,688","Petty: If you go in that doorway on the left there's some ambience there."
"00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:49,275","Schafer: It's too bad we have puzzles in both those places because it'd be funny to see a room that was there before and then just isn't there,"
"00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:51,175","like so the door is open like to the avalanche area."
"00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,020","No, we need that one."
"00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,980","Or to the like the friendship circle where something just opens and then it just like [explosive noise] just space in there."
"00:04:57,726 --> 00:05:03,681","It could just be you open it and it's just the shards of a room and there's just a bunch of yarn pals hanging on."
"00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:05,041","Aaahh!"
"00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,101","They're just stuck out there."
"00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:10,261","Petty: I was thinking that for any of the rooms like that, that we should have the doors and then continue on in animation state"
"00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:11,831","where they can't quite close or open."
"00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,360","They're just kinda..."
"00:05:14,202 --> 00:05:15,922","Schafer: They're closing over a severed human foot."
"00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:23,600","Peck: There's some cool game play that's like nonstandard stuff where like you're floating in zero gravity"
"00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,894","and so like you play around with the physics of that."
"00:05:25,894 --> 00:05:33,909","So this is one of those instances where we were in a brainstorm meeting and we were like what if the whole ship just like rotated"
"00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:36,505","because it's taking off, right?"
"00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:39,654","And everyone was like, oh shit."
"00:05:39,654 --> 00:05:43,867","Offscreen: Once you solve that and you get up here and the doors open, that's when we do the;"
"00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:46,923","and then we cut to the old scene and now you're floating above it."
"00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:48,301","You're like, how do I get down there?"
"00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:49,441","Schafer: So she could be spinning."
"00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:52,821","So there could be a timing thing that you have to do a certain thing which is aim a certain direction."
"00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:59,057","Petty: We could have like the boy's magnetic boots stuck on the hole, you know, if we wanted to use those somehow."
"00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:02,697","Schafer: And you just like want to drift over to it and grab it and use it to like."
"00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:05,017","Petty: Oh, wait, there's a scarf on the suit."
"00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,200","So if you could take the scarf off the floating suit."
"00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,160","Peck: Not exactly your typical adventure game."
"00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,360","Walk to ""A"" to ""B""."
"00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:18,985","Crap, I missed it. It's a timing puzzle."
"00:06:18,985 --> 00:06:22,601","You have to like line up the rotations of these two things."
"00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:24,799","Damn it. I missed it again."
"00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:32,525","I anticipate a lot of amazing play testing feedback from this with people being like fuck that mini game."
"00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:40,477","We've also had to think outside the box in terms of like, especially because we're reusing environments so we can't just make"
"00:06:40,477 --> 00:06:43,469","a new environment that supports really difficult puzzles."
"00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:47,270","We have to use the environments we've already made."
"00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:52,126","And so yeah, we consciously wanted to try and, try and do things that we hadn't done before."
"00:06:52,126 --> 00:06:54,854","Let's have a puzzle that goes across multiple scenes."
"00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:56,912","Let's like rotate the ship."
"00:06:56,912 --> 00:06:59,120","Let's play with the fact that we're on a spaceship."
"00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,063","We're in space."
"00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:01,403","Maybe there's no gravity."
"00:07:01,403 --> 00:07:07,340","There's this really weird plot device that we have in Act 1 where like the mom could magically manipulate everything on the ship."
"00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,631","What if Vella could gain access to that system?"
"00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:12,172","Like, that's a really cool idea to pursue."
"00:07:12,172 --> 00:07:17,674","And like a lot of really great puzzle ideas came out of that kind of, that kind of thinking."
"00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:24,239","Kipnis: It's just like ways to interact with the ship or to see the same space in a completely original context."
"00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,853","Schafer: And the team is starting to wire out the first few puzzles for Vella on the spaceship now."
"00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:31,637","That's mostly what was going on."
"00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:33,596","Reds. Unless I forgot something."
"00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:35,476","Anyone want to do anything else?"
"00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,899","Okay, now I have to go the bad and not fun part of the meeting where I have some bad news to tell you about,"
"00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,426","someone else leaving the company which is never very fun."
"00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:49,046","Isa is leaving and oh, man, come on up here, Isa."
"00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:56,420","Stamos: So I just want to let you know I'll be cheering Double Fine on, and I've loved my time here."
"00:07:57,153 --> 00:08:10,878","[Applause] Schafer: Luckily we have Matt Hanson who was our right-hand man,"
"00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:19,416","and he's stepping right into the role of being the VP of product development so he's doing that job which means he probably has less time"
"00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,422","to do producer type stuff on Broken Age."
"00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:24,742","Yeah, I might technically be short a producer."
"00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:28,007","I hadn't thought about that. Now I'm terrified."
"00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,227","I'm never gonna make December. We'll see."
"00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:38,216","That'll delay them in making that schedule that says we can't make December so that way I can hopefully get the game done before anyone realizes it's impossible."
"00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:39,296","I think we're gonna make December."
"00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,919","We'll never make December."
"00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,100","Shut up. Shut up."
"00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:48,792","Ow, that really hurts."
"00:08:55,644 --> 00:08:58,464","Peck: That's like above my pay grade, dude."
"00:08:58,464 --> 00:08:59,970","Russell: Like, what do I think?"
"00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,492","Just for me or the whole game?"
"00:09:01,492 --> 00:09:03,521","Offscreen: The whole game I guess."
"00:09:03,521 --> 00:09:05,881","Malena and I think it's gonna be March."
"00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:09,580","I'm not sure who thought ever December was really gonna be it."
"00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,478","Offscreen: Tim. Russell: Yeah."
"00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,108","Kipnis: Yeah, I don't, I don't actually know the release date at this point."
"00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:20,084","I think it's gonna be largely driven by how long it takes for all of the animations to be final"
"00:09:20,873 --> 00:09:28,713","because the animators are gonna be slammed pretty hard since some of the voice is getting into the game so late unfortunately."
"00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:33,723","Schafer: Yeah, some of the VO talent has been harder to get in the studio than others,"
"00:09:34,196 --> 00:09:41,626","and so you have a couple big characters that have yet to be recorded and that holds up all the cut scenes."
"00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:49,298","We're looking at cut scene layouts together so that Ray can know whether they're ready to go."
"00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,699","What's a layout, Ray?"
"00:09:50,699 --> 00:10:00,240","Crook: A layout is a first pass of the scene with the characters all in their sort of place and with the dialogue timed out."
"00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,917","Schafer: The rough cameras, the timing, but none of the animation."
"00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,509","Crook: Yeah, none of the animation."
"00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:08,165","Schafer: Whipped Cream Hill fail."
"00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:12,085","Crook: She gets it too."
"00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:12,865","Schafer: Who did that one?"
"00:10:12,865 --> 00:10:13,476","Crook: Miyuki."
"00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:14,496","Schafer: Is it the same?"
"00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,020","Crook: It's the exact same rig, yeah."
"00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,460","I think it's funny that it's exactly the same."
"00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:26,761","Schafer: If we can just repeat the same, she can have a whole different; I can't even think of a word."
"00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:29,401","Crook: I think the joke's funny because it is the same. Schafer: Mm-hmm."
"00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,028","Crook: If you want something different."
"00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:33,528","Schafer: No, it's good."
"00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:43,625","And then we're just finishing up on the Alpha and the G-2 act and then we've got to do the finale."
"00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,321","Petty: It's a whole area, new characters."
"00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:47,507","It's probably a lot of cut scene work."
"00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:48,984","It's probably a ton of animation."
"00:10:48,984 --> 00:10:53,193","When it's not really a 3-D world and you have to stage things specifically and you don't want to paint a million scenes,"
"00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:56,788","a lot of it really comes down to exactly what is going on in the writing and the puzzles."
"00:10:56,788 --> 00:11:00,221","Schafer: Even though we haven't been storyboarding a lot in the process, like this would be an important one to do"
"00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:08,826","because I know Peter's already talking about musical score and that London, I mean that Melbourne Symphony Orchestra gig is gonna come up."
"00:11:08,826 --> 00:11:13,772","And I think this would be a great place to have special music and not use existing cues and stuff."
"00:11:13,772 --> 00:11:18,978","So hopefully we can actually storyboard it, timing it out in the animatic and commit to that, lock that,"
"00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,818","and then have them build a score to that while we're making it."
"00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,804","Do you want to go shot by shot then?"
"00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,541","Okay, so that's the opening shot, just like here's the situation."
"00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,300","It's happened."
"00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:35,173","And then we cut into an interior shot and I was thinking interior because I was hoping we'd just fake it and it shows a bunch of red smoke because"
"00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:39,014","like they're in the room that's the hottest so it's like smoke is coming up."
"00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:43,088","Crook: So yeah, so this is the animatic with Lee's storyboards."
"00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:47,281","It's very actiony, very dramatic."
"00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:54,114","It'll require some really good performance from whoever ends up animating it."
"00:11:54,114 --> 00:12:02,125","To really just sit down and have a big, juicy acting scene, for me that's, I get the most enjoyment out of that"
"00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:06,671","because that's when your personality can come out in a way."
"00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:08,872","Yeah, it's gonna be a lot of work."
"00:12:08,872 --> 00:12:10,173","It should be."
"00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:16,434","Finales should always be a lot of work because it's 3-1/2 minutes."
"00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:22,619","So that might not sound like a lot, but that's actually, that's a really long scene."
"00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:25,423","It's a really long scene."
"00:12:25,423 --> 00:12:31,930","Because if we're really locking the timing down, which is kind of scary."
"00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:38,583","Petty: Yeah, I'm not sure why we'd have to have the music scored before we get the dialogue unless the deadlines are such that."
"00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:44,489","Crook: I think the music scores, because they're gonna be scoring Grim at the same time, right?"
"00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:45,985","Isn't that was this whole idea is?"
"00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:46,902","Petty: Oh, is it?"
"00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:51,228","Crook: I think that's what the deal is because they only want to book the orchestra once."
"00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:03,094","Crook: Isn't the idea they're gonna book the orchestra once and they're gonna do Grim and this at the same time?"
"00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:10,685","Crook: We were talking about whether we could take it to the next level or not which would be maya animatic."
"00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,932","Petty: We certainly can, but there's a ridiculous amount of work right now for all this other stuff."
"00:13:15,932 --> 00:13:18,516","And so it's just a matter of where we're putting; I can't."
"00:13:18,516 --> 00:13:19,382","I have the storyboard."
"00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:24,912","I can't really describe all this to Bagel and then have him storyboard it remotely so I have to storyboard it."
"00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:25,918","No, I mean, it can be done."
"00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:34,677","It's just; I think it just gets down to the conversation we always sort of have and don't have an answer for which is date."
"00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,712","Petty: Well, it's the only thing that a hard deadline."
"00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,660","Yeah, and then I've been working with Vic on the all timeline stuff too."
"00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:10,653","Yeah, I think we're trying to put together like a whole new pass on it and we've talked with most of the leads and everything already about stuff."
"00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:15,312","So probably within the next week or so we'll have a, ooh, bless you."
"00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,888","Probably in the next week or so we'll have a new full timeline to share."
"00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:25,829","I think it's pretty safe to say at this point already that it's not December; like we've already talked about that with pretty much everybody."
"00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:26,907","Schafer: Not me."
"00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,487","Rice: Yeah, we've talked about it multiple times."
"00:14:29,487 --> 00:14:32,267","Tim: Yeah, totally ambushed me with that December thing."
"00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:40,340","Well, they've all been talking about how they don't feel like we're gonna make December and we probably aren't, but I haven't seen any date."
"00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:42,204","You know, it's like it's all hunches."
"00:14:42,204 --> 00:14:47,153","It's all people's hunches versus hunches, but they're supposed to be doing a waterfall schedule"
"00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:53,266","which is like all the dependencies linked out and that will show us ending a certain month."
"00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:55,266","And hopefully it's not April."
"00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:01,465","But it's almost like if you believe it's going to be March then it will be March."
"00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:05,591","And if you're trying to hit December it'll be hopefully January."
"00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,150","But if everyone's just like we're not even trying to make December then we'll slip even worse."
"00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:19,554","So it's hard to kind of keep a sense of urgency on the project when you feel like; because we're spending our own money on it now"
"00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:26,209","so it's not like a publisher milestone, like the milestone's due in December and everyone just always takes that seriously."
"00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:32,263","And when we have something that's an internal milestone or a milestone that only Double Fine is holding you accountable for,"
"00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:34,318","people are like, well, we've got an extra week and stuff."
"00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:43,741","And that's a hard, a hard thing to instill that sense of like taking a milestone seriously even when it's just us because it's more money."
"00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:46,553","Every week that it goes it costs more money."
"00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:54,023","And it's longer the backers will have to wait and it's, you know, the longer that we have to put off other things we want to do."
"00:15:54,023 --> 00:15:59,071","So I still push for getting it done as soon as possible."
"00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:01,798","Rice: Yeah, there's a lot of work left."
"00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:04,730","It's probably not gonna be December, but we're figuring out when it would be."
"00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:11,171","It looks like the thing we're thinking, we're hoping for December, is we've got two more weeks on Act 2 stuff,"
"00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:16,940","and then the finale stuff we're thinking is like six for like a really solid safe Alpha."
"00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,443","And with all the like holiday stuff in before the end of the year and everything, that kind of takes us almost exactly to the end of the year."
"00:16:22,443 --> 00:16:28,125","Then you have the matter of closing it out is what we're trying to figure out now, so okay."
"00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:33,063","Annable: I could've told you like a day back in July it wasn't gonna happen for December."
"00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,736","Schafer: I'm gonna wait till I see all the numbers."
"00:16:37,736 --> 00:16:43,289","Now it's at, well, we're really close to when it should be wrapping up if it's gonna be done in December."
"00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:47,009","We should have the voice in, and we don't have the final three characters in."
"00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:49,061","We're doing that next week."
"00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:57,997","On Reds I am going down to help with the VO recording which is happening Wednesday, Thursday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday of this week."
"00:16:57,997 --> 00:17:00,132","That's for Vella."
"00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:02,770","Brown: I don't feel confident about that at this point."
"00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,954","I'll be honest."
"00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:08,547","I'm more comfortable saying what I really think because I don't want to say it on camera."
"00:17:08,547 --> 00:17:10,147","I'll just be totally blunt."
"00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:17,079","And I'll try to get us out of the studio time that we've purchased for the next four days."
"00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,332","I'm working on it."
"00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:30,726","Crook: So Tim flew down to record dialogue, Vella in particular, and she had a family emergency."
"00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:36,155","And so that kind of messes everything up."
"00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:38,478","I mean, it's not her fault."
"00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:40,098","People have family emergencies."
"00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:45,473","But it definitely kind of went into panic mode a little bit."
"00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,000","Schafer: Do you see I made a tiny gun to shoot myself?"
"00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,105","It looks effective on camera."
"00:17:53,256 --> 00:17:55,363","Crook: There you go. That's better."
"00:17:55,363 --> 00:17:57,363","Open your mouth."
"00:17:59,993 --> 00:18:00,813","It'll be all right, Tim."
"00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,900","Hansen: It's all right. We'll figure this out."
"00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:13,822","Russell: Vella, for her part of Act 2 is in almost every cut scene so there's very few cut scenes that she's actually not in."
"00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,279","And if Malena has us up to date as of today, everything that's red hasn't been recorded yet."
"00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,545","And you can guess who this might be."
"00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,725","This is Vella."
"00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:25,416","This is why we were kind of freaking out."
"00:18:25,497 --> 00:18:29,979","That's part of the reason why I made that document, just to figure out, okay, what can we do?"
"00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:34,144","What can we sort of do and may have to reanimate a little bit later?"
"00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:36,539","And what's just, we just have to have the voice?"
"00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,474","Otherwise it's just gonna be tough."
"00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:42,196","Crook: So anyway we're gonna animate to some scratch."
"00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:45,281","We're gonna not animate some scenes with Vella."
"00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:46,888","It's gonna be a mixture of things."
"00:18:46,888 --> 00:18:55,007","We're gonna be juggling a little bit and then hopefully the first week of December that's what we've been promised."
"00:18:55,007 --> 00:19:01,527","The first week of December we'll get the recordings done for Vella."
"00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:08,380","Tim: Which is really frustrating because we're so late with that dialogue and keep being even later."
"00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,380","It was nothing something we wanted to do."
"00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:20,196","Annable: Waiting for her, at a certain point it really, really hurts us and I feel like we're already beyond,"
"00:19:20,196 --> 00:19:24,426","like way beyond where we need to be for her recording."
"00:19:24,426 --> 00:19:34,010","Crook: We'd have to kind of maybe push everybody off of the project onto some other projects because you don't want to be sitting around burning through money, right?"
"00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,388","We have to be working on something all the time."
"00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:40,083","I mean, it all rides on that December, right?"
"00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:44,039","It rides on the recording actually happening in December."
"00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:50,749","Annable: And so if she's not available I think we need to have a second actor cast who is also on hold for the same days"
"00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:54,457","that we're putting Masasa on hold when she returns."
"00:19:54,457 --> 00:20:00,440","And if Masasa is unavailable then we have to go into the studio with that backup person."
"00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:08,483","Schafer: A lot of people on the team are saying we should recast, should recast Vella with an actress that we know we can get and be ready."
"00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:15,690","I'd be fine with it but now it just bugs me to think of Vella having two voices because there's no such thing as a real sound-alike."
"00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:23,218","You can sound kind of like it, but I think Masasa has a real unique voice and I think players would just know."
"00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:27,858","They would play the first act and then the second act would have a different actress, and it would be that way forever."
"00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:29,529","It would always be that way."
"00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:37,728","Annable: It sucks, but I don't want an actor to be responsible for causing so much chaos to our schedule."
"00:20:37,728 --> 00:20:44,452","Schafer: So changing Vella feels horrible to me so I'm fighting for keeping the original actress,"
"00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,459","and I'm hoping she will come through for me."
"00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:53,272","I'm going into L.A. again to see if the magical gopher will come out of its hole and record some dialogue."
"00:20:53,272 --> 00:20:55,113","We don't know what's gonna happen."
"00:20:55,113 --> 00:20:56,893","But I just go down and we see if she shows up."
"00:21:01,814 --> 00:21:04,484","Rice: And Tim is reporting right now?"
"00:21:04,484 --> 00:21:06,812","Has anyone heard? Has he sent an email yet?"
"00:21:06,812 --> 00:21:08,043","Crook: We know she showed up."
"00:21:08,043 --> 00:21:11,583","Rice: She did? Okay. She's there. Awesome."
"00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,120","Crook: So that's a good step."
"00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,700","Schafer: Back to the booths."
"00:21:18,415 --> 00:21:20,375","Moyo: A really big explosion."
"00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,980","I like it when she schemes."
"00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,160","Moyo: Hey, President Ugly."
"00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,220","Is that a dig or is that actually his name?"
"00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,440","Schafer: It's totally a dig."
"00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,240","You're pretty casual, like, hey, what's up?"
"00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,314","Moyo: Everybody thanks you."
"00:21:44,449 --> 00:22:06,307","[Music] Hansen: So this meeting is to talk about the schedule"
"00:22:06,307 --> 00:22:09,247","for finishing the rest of Act 2."
"00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:19,276","So I've met with Vic and Malena and Greg to talk through the remaining work and to put it all on a timeline to see when the thing's finishing."
"00:22:20,143 --> 00:22:23,664","This should be fairly accurate because you're updated this just recently, right?"
"00:22:23,664 --> 00:22:29,832","Romero: This is every discussion we've had, every wonderful change to our plans that's come up."
"00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:31,132","It's all on there."
"00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,620","Schafer: We thought it was going to be April so this is actually good news."
"00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,932","Hansen: It's April to release the game because it takes 3 weeks to manufacture."
"00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,403","But this is when development will be done which is..."
"00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:42,243","Petty: Manufacture?"
"00:22:43,341 --> 00:22:45,321","Hansen: Yep, so we're gonna do physical disks."
"00:22:45,321 --> 00:22:47,909","Petty: Oh, that's right so it has to be simultaneous now, right?"
"00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,330","Hansen: That's part of the deal."
"00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,472","Bailey: So we did a deal with Nordic which is yet to be released, but that's cool."
"00:22:53,836 --> 00:23:01,405","So our deal with Nordic is that they're gonna handle retail distribution of the game in Europe but also here."
"00:23:01,405 --> 00:23:07,653","So they have some relationships with retailers like Best Buy and other really huge big box stores,"
"00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:11,483","and it'd be really exciting to see Broken Age show up there."
"00:23:11,483 --> 00:23:17,057","The way it's actually working out is once we're done with the PC version we can ship it over to them"
"00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:21,548","and they have a very quick, just a few week turnaround which is exciting."
"00:23:21,548 --> 00:23:24,476","And during that time we're working on the other platforms to get them ready."
"00:23:24,476 --> 00:23:30,897","So like, you know, when you bought it, whoever's bought it on whatever platform, the hope is everybody can experience the conclusion together."
"00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,420","So that's the goal. We'll see how close we get."
"00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:41,403","Hansen: So as you can see this takes us basically to the end of the year to get the game to Alpha."
"00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:46,944","And then we would transition on to beta work when we return from the holidays."
"00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:52,531","And then we have six weeks of bug fixing and polish work at the end."
"00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:56,251","This is traditionally how long we've needed for all of our projects."
"00:23:57,027 --> 00:24:01,764","There might be some room to pull that in but I do think that the game needs that much time"
"00:24:01,764 --> 00:24:06,090","in order to address all of the play test feedback, bug fixing and polish work."
"00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,522","Schafer: Have you gone over any of this with Justin yet?"
"00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:10,422","Hansen: Only the end date."
"00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,960","Schafer: What kind of face did he make when you talked to him about the end date?"
"00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,380","Did he smile? Hansen: No."
"00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,400","Petty: So somewhere between constipation and Defcon 4. Hansen: Yeah."
"00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,500","Schafer: He also only smiles when things are really bad."
"00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:29,819","Hansen: It was not a happy face. I'll say that."
"00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,977","Schafer: That's the thing."
"00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:37,185","The information, I'm just wondering is what; financially can we go to this date or can't we?"
"00:24:37,305 --> 00:24:44,313","Because before we were talking about December and he was kind of like we can't go beyond that because of financial reasons."
"00:24:44,313 --> 00:24:49,938","And so that's what I would like to hear from him is what happens if we go to this date."
"00:24:56,448 --> 00:24:57,928","Hansen: Anything else? Tim, do you have anything else?"
"00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,720","Schafer: Some inspiring words of wisdom. No."
"00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,820","Hey, guys, how's it going?"
"00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:26,792","I'm getting a strong sense people are trying to give me the message that it's a risk to hit December."
"00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400","It's gonna be tight to make December."
"00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:36,011","That's just me reading between the lines of that meeting."
"00:25:39,691 --> 00:25:42,131","Anyway it's gonna be over soon one way or the other."
"00:25:43,132 --> 00:26:40,519","[Music] Peck: You getting this?"
"00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,380","This is good shit."
