"00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:28,953",[Music] Schafer: You know you got drunk when the next morning
"00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,860","you're just starting to think of things that you said, no."
"00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,973",I have this memory just walking down the street yelling and screaming the entire time.
"00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,740",Schafer: I love Chinatown.
"00:00:42,880 --> 00:01:19,340",[Music] Schafer: Did you see how many pages I got done?
"00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,560",So far I've got actual writing.
"00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,580",This writing paid for by Kickstarter.
"00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,760","So, it's a book. It's coming along. We came up with a code name."
"00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,840",Do you want to ask questions or should I just start talking?
"00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,120",Rice: DF adventure. Budget.
"00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,900",Schafer: Budget? We need that. We might not need that.
"00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,880",I think we can have food.
"00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,100",Launch event.
"00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,033",I hate to cut the launch event.
"00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,560",That much for PAX Prime really? Rice: Um hm.
"00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,494","Schafer: I mean that, we might not need that."
"00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,300",Let's just say if we're being really bare bones on some of this stuff.
"00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,460",Rice: We're cutting so much stuff right now.
"00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,079","Rice: Ah, it's the things that like..."
"00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,080",Schafer: Greg thought of... Everything I thought of is in.
"00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,212",Everything Greg thought of is out.
"00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:15,681",Rice: Yeah. So I was being really conservative on like trying to figure out stuff outside of just paying the members of the team
"00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:17,180",that we might need to pay for.
"00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,346",And some of that stuff might not be necessary.
"00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:22,214",So it's...
"00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,480","Schafer: Well, it's tight for me."
"00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,586","I mean, it's tight for me in terms of like the number of people we have on the team."
"00:02:27,586 --> 00:02:29,806",Like I wish we had more programmers.
"00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,674",So if we did that.
"00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:39,020","So if we cut out all those, some of those things, we'd have like another $100,000, which would be um..."
"00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,240",some programmer time.
"00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,740",Rice: Yeah.
"00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,780",Schafer: OK. All right.
"00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,180",And then we have how long to actually make the production.
"00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,740",'Til next November.
"00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,040",Next November's like infinity far away.
"00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,320",Rice: It's pretty far.
"00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,427",Schafer: We could do eight games in that time. It sounds so long.
"00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,306",Cut to November.
"00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,800",What? The game isn't started yet?
"00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,540",Wait.
"00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,500","Done with that. We're in Alpha, oh."
"00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,633",November this year? Rice: Yeah.
"00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,560","Schafer: We can't do that, it's crazy. That's insane."
"00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,060",We're starting in November next year. Rice: No.
"00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,060",Schafer: That sounds good.
"00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,459",Rice: That would be a year and a half.
"00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,540","Schafer: November this year, oh, that's much closer."
"00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,800",Rice: I mean that gives us uhh...
"00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,540","five, five whole months of production."
"00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,040",Schafer: Five whole months of production?
"00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,980",Oh my God.
"00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,520","Schafer: Well, I'm in an interesting position now because I'm running the company and I'm running a project."
"00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:43,661","So on the one hand I'm just, I'm equal to the other project leaders and I can't really abuse my ability to like pick up resource up"
"00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:44,959",and put them on a different project.
"00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,859","But I do when they're not looking, so that's fine."
"00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,640",All for the good of the project.
"00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,900","Team Member: Ostensibly, we going to take somebody off your team to put them on DFA."
"00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,026",And you're going to be short-handed.
"00:03:58,026 --> 00:04:01,386","Schafer: I mean when you're project leader, you have to kind of fight for your team."
"00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:02,847","I mean, it's a fight for resources."
"00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:08,200",And you care about the company overall but you still know that to make your game good you should get the best people on it.
"00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,733","And so you kind of, you have to do a little recruiting."
"00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,040","You have to talk to them, you know, outside of meetings and stuff and be like, hey, are you interested?"
"00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040","I think we know you'd be, this would be a good opportunity to you."
"00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,267","You could, you know, you'd be moving up or you'd be taking on more responsibility or we're doing this really cool kind of art or something like that."
"00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:25,587",Get people excited about it.
"00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,393","And mostly we just said that we're doing this project and most people like Anna and Brandon, you know,"
"00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,734",mentioned to me they wanted to work on it.
"00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,740",Dillon: I mean I was big gamer when I was a kid.
"00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,106",But like adventure games were always kind of special to me in particular.
"00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:45,593","The fact that I wound up, you know, in a configuration where I could get to work on an adventure game with, you know,"
"00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,701",with my favorite adventure game designer.
"00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:50,161",It's just crazy and still kind of mind-boggling.
"00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:58,947","Schafer: And because the schedule is so tight on DFA and it's got such a small budget, that's, that is a bit of worry, too."
"00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,600",Offscreen Voice: Holy shit!
"00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,500","Schafer: I'm nervous, though. Offscreen Voice: Why are you nervous?"
"00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,480",Schafer: 'Cause I really want Brandon on the team.
"00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,547",And so do the other teams.
"00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:28,834","So if he does something really awesome, I'm just going to get sad if we then don't get him on the team."
"00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,040",Dillon: So basically over the weekend I just wanted to prototype some tools work.
"00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,640","Schafer: Me, too. I just had, it was Easter."
"00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,320",I didn't get around to it.
"00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,240",Dillon: This is how I celebrate Easter. Schafer: It's beautiful.
"00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,720",Dillon: So I'll show you my super-awesome adventure game here.
"00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,753",Schafer: Oh my God.
"00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,480",Schafer: I didn't know you could draw. Incredible.
"00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,420","Dillon: Yeah, yeah. And I feel like we're basically done."
"00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,993","Schafer: Yeah, we just got to art this up."
"00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,574","Dillon: And so like I started with the classic data editing thing, which is walk boxes."
"00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,713","And so like got a little, you know, a walk box here."
"00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,680","Schafer: Ah, that's crazy. Dillon: Like look how accurate."
"00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,580",Schafer: Right. Now click on the outer space there. Dillon: It's fine.
"00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,720",Schafer: Let me see this. Let me see this.
"00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,986","Dillon: Oh, you're breaking the illusion.. Schafer: Oh, crash."
"00:06:15,986 --> 00:06:17,866",It was a really good puzzle.
"00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,600","Brandon is a genius and a great programmer and also someone who has like a deep love,"
"00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,640",a deeper understanding of the low level systems required but also a real affinity for adventure games and tools and pipeline.
"00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,940","Dillon: So like this is honestly the stuff that I'm most excited about, right."
"00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:42,633","It's like, you know, coming up with a tool chain for everybody to use, where like, you know, whatever crazy idea that Tim has, we can get it into the game"
"00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,707",as quickly as possible and actually see whether or not it works.
"00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:50,000",And tune it up so that it can be as good as it can be.
"00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,040",I like being behind the scenes.
"00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,160","Schafer: That's crazy, OK. Programming is actually happening, on the game All right, you guys."
"00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,440",Awesome. That's cool. We're actually doing actual work.
"00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,900",Schafer: I Probably should go design it now.
"00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,167","Dillon: It's really nice to just get something on the screen and like that's always the first step to, like it's very clarifying"
"00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:20,800","to, you know, have stuff present and actually interactive, because then it's easy to figure out what to do next basically."
"00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,120",Rice: Oliver. Franzke: Hello!
"00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,340","What have you got, man?"
"00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,280",Franzke: It's pretty cool.
"00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,000",Rice: This is the game?
"00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,481",Franzke: It's kind of a game. Rice: Oh nice! Walking in 3-D space.
"00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:46,280","Franzke: Well, it's like scaling it vertically, but that's, that's pretty much how we're going to do it in the final game as well."
"00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,520",Rice: So all these are flat planes and you're just scaling the size of the character?
"00:07:51,980 --> 00:08:00,620",Rice: And then we've got Oliver and he's doing a lot of system work on the engine and getting the engine kind of in shape.
"00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,360",Franzke: Well I was born in Germany of course i'm from Germany.
"00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,266","In fact, from East Germany."
"00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:13,300","So because of historic reasons I can be here today, otherwise I would probably be in Moscow right now, I guess."
"00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:19,640","I'd probably follow the people that work in the industry, like from a young age, you know, I always was playing games and was interested in the medium."
"00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:26,433","It's certainly kind of strange to be here now, to actually write adventure game from scratch."
"00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,500","It's kind of cool, I guess it's what a lot of people in the gaming industry kind of dream about"
"00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,980","and would love to do and it's kind of, it's awesome to be here now at this time"
"00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,679","and like be able to be part of this project, for sure."
"00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,899",It's very exciting.
"00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:47,080","I should probably mention that this is not the final game, so please nobody freak out at this point yet."
"00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,480","Schafer: You know, I've never worked with Oliver before directly."
"00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,100",He's worked on Once Upon a Monster.
"00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,433","And it's funny, he worked on the special edition of Monkey Island back at Lucas."
"00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,140",Also he's German.
"00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,826","Franzke: And if I have time, which would be awesome, like to actually dialogue system so you can initiate like a dialogue with some..."
"00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:09,426",some other thing in the world.
"00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:14,900","Kipnis: So what we're looking at is an implementation of that, of a dialogue sequencer."
"00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,460",We have this database of lines.
"00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,894",So i'm just using that to test out my system.
"00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:26,866",So I wrote this little test dataset that the red bots are going to insult each other with.
"00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,946","And so, yeah, let me show you what it actually looks like when you play it."
"00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,847","My friends had Nintendo and that was, that was the best for me."
"00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:40,507",Like I remember I played a lot of Super Mario Brothers.
"00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:49,200","And I mean, that kind of blew my mind at the time, because when I was growing up I was kind of the oldest kid."
"00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,799",And I would come up with games to play with everyone else to entertain them and stuff.
"00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:01,919",And I realized when I played Super Mario Brothers that this was kind of the same thing.
"00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,626",Like someone made up like this like little world for other people to experience and to see.
"00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:11,387",And you didn't even have to be there; And it was just like magical.
"00:10:11,387 --> 00:10:15,400",It was like magical technology where I can do this stuff that I had been doing as a child.
"00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,667","That was like my dream. I got my dream job somehow, basically."
"00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:25,161","Schafer: And she, Anna's been implementing my dialogue longer than anybody in the world."
"00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:27,781",What the hell is that sound? [siren in background].
"00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:29,281",That happens every Tuesday at noon.
"00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,720",It's not Tuesday. It is Tuesday.
"00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,320","You know, you hear this robot voice?"
"00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,040",Where's the robot voice?
"00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,540",Oh.
"00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,940",[faint distorted voice in background].
"00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,980",You can barely even hear that.
"00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,300","What if that was saying ""get out of the building""?"
"00:10:47,307 --> 00:10:48,733",I don't know.
"00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,580","It sounds like, like our government has been shut down."
"00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,413","You are all loyal servants of the...ok so I was saying,"
"00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,646","I mean no one's had to implement more of my dialogue ever than Anna, probably because she's been doing it since Psychonauts."
"00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:09,566","And hopefully on this game, I mean she's... I haven't written a lot of dialogue yet, but she already knows kind of what I'm going to write structurally."
"00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:12,146",And so she's already writing the systems to implement that.
"00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,020","Rice: So then we've also got Lee Petty, who is the art director."
"00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,100",Petty: It's kind of hard to tune for unless you have...
"00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,000",Rice: This is the old one and this is the new one.
"00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,566",Petty: That's the old one?
"00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:26,246","Rice: This is the old one, yeah."
"00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:27,340",Petty: That's a little different than I remember it.
"00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,880",Petty: I've pretty much been in the game industry since 1996 constantly.
"00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,620",I was at Accolade for about five years.
"00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,953","I worked on a variety of projects there, some of which shipped, some of which didn't."
"00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,227",I actually was cursed.
"00:11:39,227 --> 00:11:42,247","I don't remember how many years, but I think it was like my first three years in the industry,"
"00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:44,107",everything I worked on was cancelled.
"00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,100","It was like, ahhh."
"00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,666",I can't get a single game on my resume.
"00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:53,186","Luckily games didn't take three years to make each back then, right?"
"00:11:53,186 --> 00:11:54,306","Schafer: Yeah, Lee's been here for a while."
"00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:58,106","He was, came in, in the middle of Brutal Legend and took it over and made it look good."
"00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,520",He's been in the industry for a long time.
"00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,600","I think if you look at him you can see the, it's a wear on his face from the games industry."
"00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,566","No, he's worked on the games for a long time."
"00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:10,726","He knows, he knows everything."
"00:12:10,726 --> 00:12:12,454","He's, you know, he's run his own projects."
"00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,193",He ran Stacking all by himself. I didn't get involved in that at all.
"00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,580",He wrote the dialogue for it. He did everything.
"00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,420",So we're lucky to have him on projects for a little while.
"00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,960",I'm trying to figure out whether we can steal him for good or not.
"00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,121",But there's so many other things we need him to do.
"00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,680","Don't let him see this footage, though, 'cause he'll ask for a raise."
"00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,880",Rice: Yeah. We're starting to get like a team on the game.
"00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,546","Schafer: This is the nightmare team from hell, you guys."
"00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,800","You've never seen a sicker, crazier team."
"00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:44,233",Petty: I'm getting Wi-Fi but it's not connecting to the Skype.
"00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:45,833","Did you, you signed out on purpose, right?"
"00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,700","Rice: Yeah, because it went away."
"00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,000","Petty: Yeah, I don't know what's going on."
"00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,960",Skype server seemed like they're having issues.
"00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,560","Schafer: OK, this is the first stand-up. Isn't it exciting?"
"00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,327",We can't do it without Bagel. You can't get Bagel?
"00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,340",Rice: Internet's being weird.
"00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,506",Kipnis: Should we just call him?
"00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,900","Schafer: Bagel, we're having troubles with Skype."
"00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,400",Can we just speaker-phone you in?
"00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,240","Bagel: Yeah, let's do it."
"00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,940","Schafer: OK, we're doing it."
"00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,340",Rice: Is that all the way up?
"00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,507",Schafer: That's as loud as it gets.
"00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:13,787","Say hi, Bagel. Bagel: Hey, everybody."
"00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:19,907","Rice: And then we've also got, we've always had Bagel on, doing like concept arts and backgrounds and stuff like that."
"00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:27,100",But now we've got an art director on the project that'll actually start trying to take those images that Bagel has made
"00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,520",and figure out how to actually get them in a game and get them to be like working game assets.
"00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,754","Schafer: Bagel Stapley, Nathan."
"00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,653",Stapley: Buddy.
"00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,060",Schafer: Look at that baaaaaaa. Lee Petty is here.
"00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,280","Petty: What's up, Bagel?"
"00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,780",Schafer: Lee Petoir is here.
"00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:44,166",Stapley: Can you hear me? How is it?
"00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,266","Schafer: Yeah. I can hear you, can you hear me?"
"00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:47,266","Stapley: Yeah, I can hear you."
"00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:49,853","Schafer: Oh, man. I haven't paid my property taxes."
"00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,627",So embarrassing.
"00:13:51,627 --> 00:13:57,300",So one of the main things I want to do is pick what you're going to paint for Lee to mess with in after-effects.
"00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,347",Stapley: Yeah. Schafer: Remember that? Stapley: Yeah.
"00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:02,073",So is that how we're going to do it?
"00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,046",Like I'm thinking of layers basically.
"00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:08,841","Petty: The goal is just to get like a type of environment, you know."
"00:14:08,841 --> 00:14:14,234","Like maybe it looks like something that the player could walk, kind of left or right and have it scroll or into."
"00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,140",Kind of either one we could explore.
"00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,080","Schafer: Right now he's taking, you know, Bagel's work and Bagel's not a very technical person"
"00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,980",so he just paints these awesome paintings.
"00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,020",But then making it actually look good in the game is a whole different thing.
"00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:34,460",And so we've got Lee working on actually making that a realized game playing world.
"00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,327","And it's really fun to see them working together, because they're so different but they're putting together this, I think,"
"00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:41,220",awesome looking visual style.
"00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,760",Schafer: There's a lot of cabins in here.
"00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,660","Petty: Hey, that'd be a good one, Tim. That cabin."
"00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,080","So if you wanted the player walk into the screen there, like it's a little slightly different"
"00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,046",but similar to that whole circus sequence in Monkey one.
"00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:58,440",You just walk into that and they can make a move up to that top shot basically.
"00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,399",Petty: We haven't designed in the actual characters yet for the game.
"00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:04,466",Tim is still writing and coming up with exactly what the world is.
"00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:10,446",So we just sort of picked a character out of one of Bagel's sketches and put it into the game.
"00:15:10,446 --> 00:15:12,846","And we needed to do, you know, we just needed it to move around."
"00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:15,340",So I just did some really quick animation on it.
"00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,500",It's certainly not great animation but just to get it to kind of move around the world.
"00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,300",And follow the camera.
"00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:27,820","And so I think, you know, you kind of get a sense of, is how the camera might follow the player and kind of lag behind the player."
"00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,133",How it might move around the screen.
"00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:37,433","And you'll see that one of the things we're doing here with this character is that as he's in this canopy, he's kind of tinted green and darker."
"00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:40,500","And as he emerges into the sun, here he becomes a little brighter."
"00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,360","And we don't really have, you know, any true lighting that's going to paint it into the painting,"
"00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,819",but I'm doing some simple things where we're using like color gradients based on location of the world and kind of multiplying it in this character.
"00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,253",Just with the goal of getting to feel part of that environment.
"00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:58,087",And that's a type of trick that we could do technically in the game image if we wanted to.
"00:15:58,087 --> 00:15:59,181",And it's really quick to do.
"00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:01,541",But it's enough to help him harmonize with the environment.
"00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,033",Schafer: Please join me in welcoming Mr. Chris Remo to the company.
"00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:20,840",[Applause] Schafer: Remo's our community manager.
"00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,300","He's been here now for two weeks or so, ish."
"00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,520","Chris, could you please stand up."
"00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:31,560",[Laughter] Any questions about any of that stuff before we talk about projects?
"00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,960","I'll give you the update on Double Fine Adventures, awesome game."
"00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:42,060","I'm working on design stuff and we have a team actually working on tools and engine and visual,"
"00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,626",pre-visualization of what the art side will look like.
"00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:49,126","And I'm putting together one of my deliverables for the milestone, in a couple weeks."
"00:16:49,126 --> 00:16:50,306",It's like a story document and stuff.
"00:16:50,306 --> 00:16:55,500",And at that point I'll be like probably sharing more info about the game with other people company-wide.
"00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,100","Rice: Well I mean, Tim's been doing brainstorming stuff for a while."
"00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,947","And that's still what he's doing, just kind of holing up in his office and figuring out what the game is."
"00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,425","Schafer: You know, at the very beginning I'm locked in my room a lot writing dialogue."
"00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:16,453",But then I kind of have the job of pulling this whole thing down the road.
"00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,013","You know, so I was ready to finally pitch to the team."
"00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,819","I'm not really, haven't really felt right to pitch to the whole company yet."
"00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,699","That'll come later but, so I pitched to the whole team."
"00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,380",Schafer: OK. So I'm going to talk about the game today with everybody.
"00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,040",And some people have heard about it and some people have not.
"00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,640",Did I talk to you about the game?
"00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,240","Some people have not, not just you."
"00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,333",[Laughter] Petty: There're several people in Wisconsin.
"00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,953","Schafer: As you see, I've made a lot of progress."
"00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,480",I've designed some monster designs. Rice: I like it.
"00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:53,440",Schafer: And then I was going to go and do some detail about some ideas for the beginning of one side of the story.
"00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,200","Just 'cause the first example, like a sample game play and then we can all tear it apart"
"00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,520","and talk about how it's never, never, never going to work."
"00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,920",Schafer: And it's an interesting process where...
"00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,680",deciding when to solicit feedback and when to actually sell.
"00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,713",It's like sometimes you're selling and sometimes looking for feedback.
"00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:20,960","And the idea... And early on I could sense like in the meeting, 'cause we talked about that as being a feedback session about the pitch and stuff."
"00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,007","I realized I didn't want any feedback right then, like any in-depth feedback."
"00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:30,926",So I kind of pitched the game and then kind of moved the meeting forward and ended it and because there is an early stage
"00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:34,454",where you don't want any feedback because it doesn't really mean anything.
"00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:39,487",Because they don't know still entirely what you're thinking and they might have an image in their head
"00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,680",but it probably isn't exactly like what I have in my head.
"00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,653",So I almost don't want their opinion of it because they're not talking about the thing I'm talking about.
"00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,460","They're talking about their own, how they see it."
"00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,180",Offscreen Voice: Can I contribute as a devil's advocate?
"00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:57,446",Schafer: I like where this is going.
"00:18:57,446 --> 00:19:02,466",Remo: To me the strongest parts of this by far are the thematic aspects of the two characters in parallel.
"00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:06,420","Especially switching between those, I think, could be incredibly important and really, really cool."
"00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:13,580",Both in terms of game play and aesthetics and the stuff supporting that seems so high-concept to me that it might end up being top-heavy.
"00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:18,740","Like it seems, it just seems like a really complicated thing."
"00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:26,500","Schafer: People at, you know, at that meeting can bring up any sort of problems but it's just too early, you know."
"00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,920","I dare them. Nice try, Chris Remo."
"00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,987",What were we thinking inviting that guy to the meeting?
"00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:39,100","Hey, maybe this thing you're doing shouldn't be done. Thanks."
"00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,140",Remo: That's... I mean...
"00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,760","Schafer: I guess because I see it working in my head, it isn't that complicated."
"00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:53,466","I see that being like just providing a structure, actually, to how everything has to behave."
"00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:58,406","Schafer: I do want is like when I say the idea, what other ideas that makes that person think of."
"00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,700",Like you know what would be cool? And how they want to add to it.
"00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,520",Petty: I love hearing new ideas.
"00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:09,620","I like, Tim is a very, a lot of times Tim, the way he describes ideas is like, like the fact he described a box cover for a game"
"00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,787",that doesn't exist is a very Tim thing to do.
"00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:16,540","Like he has, he's not an artist per se, like visual artist, but he thinks very visually."
"00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,446","And I think that's helpful for someone like me and it's probably why we work so well together, is, you know,"
"00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:26,980","he's got these ideas and I can sort of, you know, as he's drawing out the birthday cakes and stuff like that"
"00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,000",I probably shouldn't talk about...
"00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,380","As he's drawing out some of the ideas on the white board in really simple fashion, I'm immediately starting to think about like,"
"00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,374","well, how's that going to put together in the space and how can we emphasize that or make that work."
"00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,813",And so that's exciting to hear.
"00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,353",Schafer: Anyway. So you pick which side you're on.
"00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,527","I've only been, I've been working on this one a little bit."
"00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:51,020",So imagine it would just kind of scroll the boy off the screen.
"00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,940",And she would be sitting here leaning on this tree on a hillside.
"00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,247",My drawing gets worse and worse the more people are watching.
"00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:05,587",Kipnis: Are those her legs? Schafer: It could be Lee: She's a tick.
"00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:08,907","Schafer: Yeah, turns out she's a tick in the end."
"00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,540","Kipnis: They're both human. Schafer: They're human, yeah, yeah, they're human."
"00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,166","Petty: Yeah, I think the idea's really cool and I think visually, I think there's a lot of interesting stuff that we have,"
"00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:27,000","I haven't really had a chance to talk to Tim yet, but I think there's a lot of interesting stuff thematically"
"00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,840",that is appealing to me.
"00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,940","I mean, there's this sort of almost Tale of Two Cities quality to it."
"00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:37,306",I can see a lot of good ambiguity in the way that that story is structured.
"00:21:37,306 --> 00:21:39,300","I think that's really, will be great."
"00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:44,200","And to be a way that we, from a design and narrative way move the genre forward a little bit."
"00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,380","Kipnis: I want, I want something new to be brought to the table that wasn't there before."
"00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:56,200",And I'm not sure what that is quite yet because I still don't have like a very clear idea of what the game's going to be like.
"00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,494",But hopefully I can contribute to that.
"00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:06,760","Franzke: Yeah, I know, I'm confident from a technology point of view be able to do what is necessary."
"00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:09,560",I hope it's going to be good.
"00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:20,986",[Music] Schafer: All right. Rice: Wait you forgot the big thing.
"00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:22,306",Rice: Bar crawl.
"00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,260",Schafer: Who can go to the bar crawl tonight?
"00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,520","Petty: I can't go tonight. I'm too sick, actually. I have to go home and sleep."
"00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:46,360","[Music] Offscreen Voice: Actually, Tim, can you just say what we're doing again?"
"00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,500",Schafer: Where... you don't know where we're going?
"00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480",Kipnis: It's for the camera.
"00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,400","But you know, should I make sound really natural like I'm just happy to be talking about it?"
"00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,300","Kipnis: Hey Tim, where are we going, by the way? Do you know?"
"00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,434",Schafer: What? Kipnis: Where are we going?
"00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,640",Schafer: I don't know. Where are we going? No.
"00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,900",Tonight is a very special night because we are going to retrace the history of Double Fine
"00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,533",through the code names of our projects.
"00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,800",Shall we do that again?
"00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,440",Projects.
"00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:25,000","The history of our company as told by the code names of our projects, which are mostly taken from Chinatown dive bars."
"00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,753",Offscreen Voice: Why don't you tell us about what happened last night?
"00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,620","Schafer: You mean between me and, oh, oh."
"00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,180",Last night.
"00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,313",So we went on a quest last night to find a code name for the project.
"00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,434","It's fun. I mean we used to, like in the very beginning of the company,"
"00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,146","when we only like, the whole company was like twelve people, we'd go out a lot together."
"00:23:43,146 --> 00:23:47,026",And go bar crawling together and we hadn't done that a lot lately.
"00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,387",But it was fun to get back out there again with the team.
"00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:53,867","Kipnis: I think you're, you're greatly overestimating my alcohol tolerance."
"00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,420",Schafer: All I heard is you are great.
"00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,060",[Laughter] Schafer: It was like a team kickoff event.
"00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:07,593",[Music] Schafer: Lipo was the very first code name of our very first project.
"00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,967",This is the code name for Psychonauts.
"00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,220",Rice: Never heard of it. What's that? Schafer: Let's go.
"00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,633",Schafer: Buddha is the code name for Brutal Legend.
"00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,507","Hi, I'm Tim. Nice to meet you. What's your name?"
"00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:21,587",Man: Peace again. Schafer: That's a weird name.
"00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,660",Schafer: EZ5 is the code name for Happy Action Theater.
"00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,933",Grasslands was our code name for Psychonauts II.
"00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,140","Who knows if that'll happen. If that happens, we call it Grasslands."
"00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,807","Bow Bow was the code name for Brutal Legend II, we started on that."
"00:24:39,807 --> 00:24:57,094",[Singing] Schafer: There's some documents called Bow Bow.
"00:24:57,233 --> 00:24:58,973",Vesuvio was Once Upon a Monster.
"00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,573","Empress is short for Empress of China and Empress was the sequel to Once Upon a Monster or Twice Upon a Monster,"
"00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,613",it probably would have been called but that got cancelled.
"00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:13,987","But you still go there. It's important to go there and remember, pour out a drink for the cancelled projects."
"00:25:13,987 --> 00:25:40,500",[Clinking glasses] Schafer: And last night we found what might be the last bar in Chinatown
"00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,600",that we haven't named anything after and that's Red's.
"00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,486","Schafer: Hey, here's to the Red's team. Red's."
"00:25:59,486 --> 00:26:02,286",That doesn't sound bad at all. Red's.
"00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,800",Schafer: Code name Red's.
"00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:12,233",[Music]
