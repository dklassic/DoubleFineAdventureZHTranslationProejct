"00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,900","Stapley: Yeah, that's pretty. Pretty colors."
"00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,320","Stapley: Yeah, I was looking at the end there."
"00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,733","The 20th of September, October, November, December, January, February, March, April."
"00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,800","So yeah, everything looks cool here."
"00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,760","Yeah, those last three months right there seems like there's going to be a lot of changing."
"00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,060","[Laughs} From November to February looks a little crazy."
"00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,000","Yeah man. It's going to be pretty nuts."
"00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:51,280","[Music] [quite fantasy music]"
"00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,196","Petty: Well, then we need to come up with another plan because right now it's not possible."
"00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,878","There's just not, one artist can't be the primary, like he's the, he's the, you know, like literally he's the renderer for every object in the game."
"00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,211","And do concept design on the schedule we have."
"00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:11,255","Schafer: I think if I hadn't been through the process before, I'd think the project was falling apart last month."
"00:02:11,255 --> 00:02:15,964","It definitely is a little bit of a tension as you switch gears and you're talking about practical matters."
"00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:20,345","But it wasn't that tense, you know."
"00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,102","Petty: For all the artists involved but certainly for Bagel, we're going to have make, you're going to have decide, I guess,"
"00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,120","which, what you want the hierarchy of his time to be spent on."
"00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:36,042","[Ambient sci-fi music] Schafer: I want him to come up with both the, you know,"
"00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:42,750","that really just like content and then actual style, both."
"00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,704","Petty: There's other options there, that we talked about all those options."
"00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:48,724","I don't think we've committed to one particular solution yet."
"00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:52,684","Rice: I think it's an ongoing conversation, so not really."
"00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,768","Schafer: I mean yeah, we're doing, since we're doing a game that's like a different engine type than we've ever done before, it's like 2D."
"00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:16,220","A whole different engine, new devices we'd never worked on and an adventure game, which we would have never made a straight adventure game here at this company."
"00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,506","So we're doing so many new things with this project that we're just learning."
"00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:23,867","Every time we try to do something, we find out like that's not going to work."
"00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,233","We do have to, of course, correct and try different solutions."
"00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,920","But that's totally normal, expected."
"00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,960","Offscreen Voice: Don't fuck with my wall."
"00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,240","Rice: But I mean, like a lot of it isn't like, there's a problem, we're fucked."
"00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:42,540","It's like we need to pay attention to this and try to start figuring out ways to make it work."
"00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,323","And we started thinking about that and feeling more comfortable."
"00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,927","Schafer: Well, we have, we brought on Levi and he's helping out."
"00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,726","Rice: We have some new people, but like they're getting familiar with everything pretty quickly."
"00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:58,301","Ryken: I was actually, on Friday I was looking at this."
"00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,080","Just getting inspired."
"00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,383","This is the museum near Tokyo."
"00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:06,853","It's super cool and I went there and I bought that there."
"00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,916","And for Friday, I just, the first thing in the morning I was getting inspired looking at that."
"00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,120","And then someone was like, you know what?"
"00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,879","They're playing a bunch of those right now and apparently for like two weeks they're playing all of those studio Ghibli films."
"00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,180","And I'm just going to be there every day."
"00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:26,434","It's happening right now. Yeah."
"00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,786","Over the weekend I saw three: I saw Nausicaa, which is like a big inspiration for stuff that we're doing right now."
"00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:34,059","[Offscreen] Yeah we just watched that last week."
"00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:35,619","Really great, it's really great."
"00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,033","Rice: Yeah. We had like another art slot."
"00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,140","We didn't know what we were going to fill it with and like right now it makes sense"
"00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,240","because concepts the most needed and that's why Levi's around."
"00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,148","But I mean, who knows?"
"00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:56,406","Like later in the project we could be ramping down on concept and need more animation and have to switch it out."
"00:04:56,406 --> 00:05:02,254","But yeah, we always had one other spot for an artist and I'm glad that it was Levi."
"00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,305","Offscreen Voice: How far along did Peter Chan get with his contributions?"
"00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,960","Rice: How far did Peter get?"
"00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:15,600","I think the last stuff that Peter did was some environment designs for spaceship stuff."
"00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,073","Schafer: All right. It's been good talking to you, Peter."
"00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,851","Chan: Thank you again, you guys, for everything and it was a lot of fun."
"00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,255","And to be part of it."
"00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:26,001","So thank you for inviting me."
"00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:29,201","Schafer: We'll see you again. Petty: Thanks, Peter."
"00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:30,416","Rice: Yeah, it was a bit of a bummer."
"00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:36,493","I mean, he was offsite so it wasn't like we were hanging out all the time, which would have been super fun."
"00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,400","But still, like I did look forward to every Friday, getting like a drop of art from him."
"00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:49,424","But Levi's around so like having him right next door and getting to see his stuff, which has been like a totally different take on it and you know,"
"00:05:49,424 --> 00:05:52,230","being able to hang out with him in the office has been fun."
"00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,337","Rice: Yeah. I don't know if you talked to Lee much about what you're going to start with, concept-wise."
"00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,071","Ryken: Yeah, I have concept stuff for boy world stuff."
"00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,840","Rice: Did you check out Peter's? Ryken: Yeah."
"00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,820","Rice: Yeah, are you scared?"
"00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,080","It's a lot to live up to, man."
"00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,260","Ryken: I'll get out my tracing paper."
"00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,160","Rice: Yeah, I don't think it works that way."
"00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,700","Ryken: Peter Chan did a bunch of the early stuff and I've been looking at what he's been doing."
"00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:23,692","This is me, actually look at this."
"00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,980","That's bootleg P. Chan."
"00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,680","Schafer: And we have interviewed an intern, an art intern."
"00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,863","I haven't met her yet, but everyone seemed to like her and think she was good."
"00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,232","And that would help, too."
"00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,821","Offscreen Voice: Oh no, you filmed that!"
"00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:43,701","Schafer: Please also join me in welcoming Marius from Germany, where did he go..."
"00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:45,700","There he is! Marius Fitz..."
"00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,358","I'm going to have you pronounce your last name."
"00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,887","Can you pronounce your last name for us?"
"00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,880","Fietzek: Fietzek."
"00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,788","Schafer: You know, Marius was the one who made an adventure game as a job application for Double Fine, which seems very nice."
"00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:15,066","Fietzek: Hey, I heard about the Double Fine Adventure and was super-hyped and yeah, I thought like if I want to,"
"00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:23,726","if there's a chance to work with my idols on the 2D animated game, then this is like the only chance maybe ever."
"00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:30,886","So I made an, application video game."
"00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,835","Schafer: Our plan is to actually release that as a Double Fine Adventure and then pocket all the Kickstarter money."
"00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,680","We'll give you a small percentage of it."
"00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,622","How long will Marius be here, Mr. Greg Rice?"
"00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,900","Rice: Three months."
"00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,802","Schafer: You get three months, holy cow."
"00:07:46,802 --> 00:07:48,486","And what will he be doing?"
"00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,220","Rice: Who knows? Schafer: Who knows."
"00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,040","Rice: Animating. Schafer: You'll do some animating on Red's."
"00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:02,098","Fietzek: But I started with the whole cinematic approach on the very first cut scene, just to see how it feels."
"00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:12,078","I thought of a very quiet start where we first see the spaceship, because I don't, I don't remember a point at the space boy part"
"00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,591","where we actually see the ship."
"00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,741","Schafer: Well, Marius is great."
"00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:21,385","Like he's like, he'll just show us, you know, a story board and it's really hard to like how someone do something"
"00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:24,981","that's really great and really funny, but just for what you were thinking of it, maybe it's not right."
"00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,629","Schafer: And the same way the girl starts."
"00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:33,482","She's just laying on the hillside and it's not a cut scene, but like a steady state; you exit out of it by tapping."
"00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:34,657","And the same way with this."
"00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:40,285","It's really got to be that it pans over and shows him and he's laying there on the bed, and the same kind of just, you know."
"00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,161","[Schafer] So you got to like tell him, like I had to tell him like this whole sequence was backwards."
"00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:48,221","And he's like, oh great, OK, great."
"00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:50,581","And then I come back the next day and it's completely different."
"00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:53,361","Exactly the way I wanted and it's perfect and it's like, oh, that's great."
"00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:18,369","[Schafer vocalizing sound effects] Schafer: That's awesome."
"00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,990","Schafer: You know, it's like, finding someone like that is really, it's hard to find people like that and so you kind of hang onto them."
"00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,563","Of course, he's supposed to go back to school."
"00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,560","So then you have to figure out whether you want to derail someone's education by trying to recruit them to come to your company."
"00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,882","Which of course, I have no problem with."
"00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:38,322","I'm already done thinking about it and I've already thought about it while I was saying that sentence, so, so much for his education."
"00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:45,155","[Laughter] Rice: We're finally like fully staffed and we've got like our team,"
"00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,867","all of our budget's totally spent on everyone who's on the team."
"00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:56,860","So I think that, you know, a month or so from now it's going to feel like everything's just kind of moving forward steadily and the game is being made."
"00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,455","Rice: At the time when we started the Maiden Feast, that was kind of the only puzzle that was far enough along"
"00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,605","that we had enough of a design to actually start building stuff."
"00:10:15,605 --> 00:10:21,460","So we did know going in that it was like a super kind of meaty puzzle that was going to be a tough one to implement."
"00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,060","And we still, you know, it was kind of all we had to go on at the point."
"00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,868","Schafer: I had the Maiden's Feast designed so they had to like, oh, we got to pick that, 'cause that's the only thing that's really designed."
"00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:35,802","Rice: But by the time we'd gotten it to like the first pass kind of state, then we had designs for this Cloud Colony stuff,"
"00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:41,282","which we knew was just a lot easier to implement and a lot more indicative of the rest of the game."
"00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:49,120","Schafer: So navigation across different layers and pointing and clicking, talking to people, camera motion is all part of Cloud Colony."
"00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,770","Rice: One of the nice things about being able to make those kinds of decisions and jump around is we can like really look at in the moment"
"00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:04,160","what is most important for the game and be able to kind of like change tracks, without having to like clear that decision with a publisher."
"00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:12,405","Schafer: So we kind of left Maiden Feast where it was, which is, you know, has like a stand-in, a couple stand-in pieces of art in there."
"00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,706","Much as it pains me to leave that unfinished, but we'll revisit it soon, I think."
"00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:22,766","Schafer: This is a kick-off meeting for the Cloud Colony."
"00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,280","Required reading for this meeting is this document everyone' read, I'm sure."
"00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,719","I've already started working on it."
"00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:36,241","So I think it's just good to go over all the puzzles in case it exposes things we haven't thought of or just questions you guys have."
"00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,140","Are you ready? Ready to begin?"
"00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:46,440","Schafer: This is the part of the game right after the Maiden's Feast when you get, when you break away and you hitch a ride on that buzzard, on the corset."
"00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,540","And you fly."
"00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,242","It takes you up into the air."
"00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:57,075","She's the sacrifice girl who's just chosen to run away instead of being sacrificed and feels that she may have just endangered,"
"00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,441","she's been told that this will endanger her entire town if the monster's not appeased."
"00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:10,018","So now the monster's all upset and she's feeling like I have to do something to get rid of this monster and to protect my family and my town."
"00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,458","But before I get back there I'm going to have to like figure out a plan."
"00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:24,689","So she arrives in the home world, if you will, of the bird, which is a little village made of primarily nests that have been,"
"00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:28,349","that are buoyant on these really thick clouds, that we're calling the Cloud Colony."
"00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:38,107","[Music] Schafer: I feel much better because I actually, like I felt good"
"00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:41,867","after I wrote that cloud document, but that was really only like four puzzles."
"00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:44,667","And the spaceship one has like sixteen puzzles in there or something."
"00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:45,907","So I'm catching up now."
"00:12:45,960 --> 00:13:09,880","[Music] Schafer: Aha! Work. I did work."
"00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,240","This is the spec for the whole spaceship."
"00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,660","Designed all the puzzles for the spaceship."
"00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,140","Offscreen Voice: Really? All the puzzles?"
"00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,000","Schafer: Yeah, all the puzzles for the spaceship."
"00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,980","And this is just two-thirds of the puzzles for the girl's world."
"00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,580","But there's still, I mean, there's still a lot of stuff to design."
"00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,500","Schafer: But it's like I have plot points, you know."
"00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,407","I have things where I know I want that to end, Act One."
"00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:40,141","And then that ends Act Two."
"00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:42,250","And then I have these plot points that happen."
"00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:49,830","And then to get to that plot point you have to create obstacles and puzzles at the same time, which come out of the story."
"00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,510","Break out of routine."
"00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,304","Spaceship boy has this routine that he's stuck in every day in space and he has to break out of it."
"00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:58,304","That's the first puzzle."
"00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,269","You do work backwards."
"00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:02,803","Like you know, it's like you actually aren't designing puzzles."
"00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:05,243","You're designing the obstacles in a lot of ways."
"00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:13,101","Like you say, you had a situation in the game where character, you just know there's a plot point where they have to shoot the President."
"00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,162","And so, I don't have any plans to shoot the President."
"00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:18,422","So, but anyways, say that was a puzzle in the game."
"00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:19,961","The President's really bad."
"00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,238","You got to shoot the President."
"00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,673","You know, I work backwards, so some cool wish fulfillment, like OK, he's going to be, he's sneaking into the White House."
"00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,823","How would you sneak into White House?"
"00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:30,813","You could wear a mask that made you look like a visiting ambassador."
"00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,483","Like how do you make a plaster cast of his face to make the mask?"
"00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:36,343","Then maybe it's to trick him into tripping and falling in cement."
"00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:39,102","And then at each point you think, OK, was that an actual revelation?"
"00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:43,562","Like you don't want to have, it just be a series of tedious chores."
"00:14:43,562 --> 00:14:47,663","It's got to be like oh, I have a really clear problem that I need to solve."
"00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:52,023","Like the three most obvious ways to solve it don't work."
"00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,061","And the game anticipates that and like has a great response for when you try to execute that solution."
"00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:58,912","You put a little like, aha!"
"00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,745","Good try, no."
"00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:02,565","But did you think about this?"
"00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:07,211","And that little nudge is like, oh, you know, kind of, like doesn't give you the answer"
"00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,900","but kind of points you back towards the ballpark where the answer is."
"00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,681","Schafer: This is the first puzzle."
"00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:16,401","So the puzzle is that you open this a little bit."
"00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,176","And then you try to go to it, it closes."
"00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:28,269","And then there's some really counterintuitive, almost opposite of normal way of thinking that makes you realize, ah!"
"00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,714","If I did this really weird thing, that would actually work."
"00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,140","The thing you had to do with the lock is take the lock and actually lock the gate shut."
"00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,380","So now when you try to pull the chain, it can't pull the gate up and instead..."
"00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,546","'Cause then the player's like, oh, I'm so smart, you know."
"00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:03,566","I figured it out."
"00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,400","Now that a lot of stuff is designed ahead of those guys and they're able to look at it and work on it."
"00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,267","That always relieves a little bit of tension."
"00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,524","Rice: Tim has filled in, it looks like boy world and I think he's even put more girl world stuff in."
"00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,104","Have you even looked at this, really, Levi?"
"00:16:24,104 --> 00:16:25,552","Ryken: This is all Tim does?"
"00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,586","I thought he was supposed to be writing things, not just writing little things on Post-its."
"00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:29,926","Rice: Yeah, he's writing the whole game on little Post-its."
"00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:30,926","Ryken: Oh, OK."
"00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,100","Rice: There wasn't much there before, so it's nice to see that it's filled out."
"00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,908","Rice: It's definitely unique and different than anything he's designed or written before."
"00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,260","So I think it's cool to see that he's trying something different and kind of going out on a limb a little bit."
"00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,685","I haven't seen any writing yet, so I don't know what that's going to be like."
"00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:52,121","Because it does seem like this game has a much more serious tone than his other games have,"
"00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,464","but I'm excited to get to that point where I start seeing Tim's writing, because I'm sure it'll be awesome."
"00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,420","Rice: So far this is in the game."
"00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,060","This is all in the game."
"00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,919","It looks like this."
"00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,460","This is all in the game."
"00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,800","And now we're going to be starting on some of this stuff."
"00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,719","Rice: And we have an approved girl, so that's exciting."
"00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,284","Petty: So let's see."
"00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,439","So let's look at the suicide girl. So she's got..."
"00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,922","Schafer: See, you call her suicide girl, too."
"00:17:17,922 --> 00:17:19,462","Petty: Yeah. Schafer: It's sacrifice girl."
"00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:20,402","Petty: I know it is."
"00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,120","So which of these dresses do you like the most?"
"00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,113","Schafer: My favorite one is that one, but I like the original one."
"00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,707","I like that one, too."
"00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:34,087","Schafer: So I just put them in front of my daughter and let her pick."
"00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,860","That solved the whole problem."
"00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,202","Schafer: These are the princesses from papa's new game."
"00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:40,202","Schafer: I call them princesses."
"00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:41,322","Which one do you like best?"
"00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,800","Think really hard."
"00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,620","Why do you like em?"
"00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,060","Daughter: Because she's so beautiful."
"00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,751","Rice: And she's looking good."
"00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,720","We just got her in the game."
"00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,820","She's walking around and everything."
"00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,441","The boy's getting there."
"00:18:03,441 --> 00:18:05,261","We've done like two rounds on him."
"00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,660","Schafer: Scott's been working on characters in the morning."
"00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:14,024","He's been kind of splitting his time with a book that he's working on, an art show or one of the zillion things that he does."
"00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:15,410","He's very busy."
"00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:22,431","Campbell: So it's an ongoing kind of, kind of project and this is the culmination of it."
"00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,496","Culmination of like a year, you know, like a year and a half's worth right now."
"00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,060","And then we have a book coming out, so that's what we're doing, so."
"00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,243","Schafer: He's drawn some of the sacrifice girl and spaceship boy."
"00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:35,658","He's been drawing some of the Cloud Colony people."
"00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,254","And I'm supposed to look at those, right."
"00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,760","I've got to give him feedback on those."
"00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,036","Schafer: I do like that guy, too."
"00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,940","But then again he is doing a cool pose."
"00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,843","Campbell: And it's going great, man."
"00:18:44,843 --> 00:18:45,947","It's looking really good."
"00:18:45,947 --> 00:18:51,547","I definitely feel that like relaxation of like knowing that like these designs, even if they're a little unfinished,"
"00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:56,280","I know they're going to go to Bagel and he's going to make them like, fucking make 'em Bagel-style."
"00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,860","Dude, I just swore again."
"00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,080","I mean, I thought for sure I wasn't going to swear in these things."
"00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,888","I'm mellowing out, dude."
"00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:04,125","But yeah, he's doing great."
"00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,745","He has a lot of work ahead of him, though."
"00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:09,280","He's stressed about it, but Bagel's the kind of guy, he's like just this kind of chill dude, you know."
"00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,868","He's like, I know."
"00:19:10,868 --> 00:19:14,676","He's like, I'm going to, he's like, I'm going to have a lot of work ahead of me, but ah."
"00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,316","'Cause it's like it's all fun stuff, you know, he's doing what he loves, which is like painting that stuff, you know."
"00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:27,408","And he's definitely, he's definitely feeling kind of nervous, but I'm so excited for it to be his, his look, so yeah."
"00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,617","Offscreen Voice: So Bagel's in the studio this week? Rice: Yeah."
"00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,860","Bagel's in my house this week. Offscreen Voice: Perfect."
"00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,108","Rice: He had to take Marius's spot from the couch."
"00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:50,728","So Marius got kicked out."
"00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,460","I'm like running a hostel right now."
"00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,080","Stapley: Yeah, it's weird."
"00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,860","There's a lot of farting going on."
"00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,980","He has these weird nerdy glasses that he wears at night."
"00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,200","Schafer: Why is Bagel in the office this week?"
"00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,420","I don't know."
"00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,640","Hi guys."
"00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,900","Schafer: Hi, oh my god you look so real."
"00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,360","Lee: He's come out of the camera!"
"00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,140","Schafer: The microphone is working so well today."
"00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,800","Bagel: My microphone is awesome!"
"00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,520","Crook: Now we can't turn you down."
"00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:24,785","Schafer: Lee was starting some new processes with art production, like trying to get Bagel to be pretty independent"
"00:20:24,785 --> 00:20:27,844","where he could just paint actual art for the game right into the engines."
"00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:33,386","So getting that set up was really hard to do over Skype or Google Hang Outs, like we do."
"00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,280","We don't always have the smoothest conversations over that, I don't know if you noticed."
"00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,192","Stapley: [inaudible] Petty: I think we're going to do it tomorrow."
"00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,358","Stapley: [inaudible] Petty: What's that?"
"00:20:45,462 --> 00:20:48,900","Stapley: [inaudible] Petty: I'm sorry, I can't make it out, dude."
"00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,180","Stapley: [inaudible] [Laughing]"
"00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,724","Stapley: But it is good to kind of sit right with them, you know."
"00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:06,243","Crook: Yeah, I think this texture, the painting style goes really well with this sort of weird... Stapley: Brush stroke."
"00:21:06,243 --> 00:21:07,274","Crook: the way we're animating it."
"00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,660","I think it goes really well with it."
"00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,133","I think it's cool."
"00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,142","Stapley: But yeah, there are some things that are easier just to talk to, like walk over to Lee and talk to him, I think."
"00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:18,393","I've already done that like three times today, which is pretty nice."
"00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,313","Rice: And here like with such a small art team, like it's going to be really important that he's not only painting stuff"
"00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:29,240","but like making sure it gets into the game right and looks good and he's viewing it in the game and seeing how that changes."
"00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,700","Petty: So like Brandon spent a lot of time making sure that all the tools he was writing"
"00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,320","were going to help Bagel and make sure that that was a really smooth process."
"00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:46,610","Brandon: The main thing that I've been working is enhancements to our scene editor so that the tool works a little bit more like Photoshop"
"00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,603","in terms of being able to hide and show the layers that you're working on."
"00:21:49,603 --> 00:21:54,622","I got the Nav meshes in there so that instead of just editing these in text files you can actually,"
"00:21:54,622 --> 00:21:59,422","you know, individually kind of lay out the geometry for the walkable areas."
"00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,883","Just really trying to flesh the stuff out so that the workflow for artists is a lot smoother."
"00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:10,064","Rice: And it's almost there so I think that's the, that's the idea, is to try to get him comfortable with that process."
"00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,980","Stapley: Yeah, so you can see..."
"00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:19,824","Right. Right, right."
"00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,660","Still totally getting used to this shit."
"00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:52,350","[Music] Stapley: Hey, bros. What's up?"
"00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,050","How's it going, fellows?"
"00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,840","Offscreen Voice: So, has this been coming along?"
"00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,482","Stapley: Oh, it's almost done, it's almost done."
"00:22:58,667 --> 00:22:59,827","No, I'm just kidding."
"00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,538","It's not done at all."
"00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,700","I'm going to give up on it and come back to it later."
"00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:11,188","And there's a bunch of other shit to do and I like don't have any fresh eyes on it anymore, you know."
"00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,860","I've just been looking at the same thing for like a week and I'm over it."
"00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,140","I'm going to just work on it until stand-ups and then Tim's going to check it out."
"00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,380","Petty: In terms of like how good the readability is."
"00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:28,278","If it's feeling right to you, you know, story, theme-wise and all that, before he digs into some of the other areas."
"00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,404","And then you know, like there's a lot of, like because that Cloud Colony..."
"00:23:31,404 --> 00:23:34,660","Schafer: I can see how the world's going to look pretty and how it's going to all look like it's one cohesive thing,"
"00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:44,688","but the secret thing that I'm hoping for is still, we have some of the, Bagel's ideas that only he would come up with for the landscape."
"00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,620","Kind of bizarre."
"00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,700","He doesn't have those in there yet."
"00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,860","Stapley: Yeah, this was Peter's, Peter's concept ideas."
"00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,105","Lee's layout."
"00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,341","Would I do a painting of this?"
"00:23:57,341 --> 00:23:58,201","I'm not sure."
"00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,260","I don't know if I would."
"00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,740","But like I'm doing a painting of it now."
"00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,880","OK, man."
"00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,918","I'm wondering about that Bagel filter thing."
"00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,140","I'm just wondering what it is, you know."
"00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,260","What if Tim's happy with it."
"00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,280","I should talk to Tim."
"00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,520","Schafer: I have not talked to him about that."
"00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,000","I haven't talked to him on this trip about how he's feeling about everything."
"00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,440","That'll be interesting."
"00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,438","Hopefully we get some alone time."
"00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,780","Petty: I just don't know about the painting Bagel."
"00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,600","Now how are you feeling about the like..."
"00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,300","We've been going back and forth a long time just trying to get a feel for that whole process."
"00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,137","Stapley: The paining process? Petty: Yeah."
"00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,904","And then like work on this big ass fucking layered files and..."
"00:24:37,904 --> 00:24:40,029","Stapley: Yeah, yeah. I'm comfortable with that."
"00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:43,840","I'd like to actually get involved more with like the concept stuff, though."
"00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,420","Petty: Yeah?"
"00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,842","Stapley: I feel like I'm just kind of a painter."
"00:24:46,842 --> 00:24:52,988","I just feel like people are expecting it to be mine somehow, you know, just 'cause, you know."
"00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,820","That's what people are saying."
"00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,659","And like it's supposed to be my style but it isn't really."
"00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,790","Petty: It may be that you're feeling like the painting isn't the side that you care about most."
"00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:07,167","Maybe you feel more about the shape, language and the concept design and we, you know, Levi does painting and you do layouts."
"00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:09,467","There's flexibility there."
"00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,502","Stapley: Where like I don't paint everything but be kind of like overlook, you know."
"00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,820","Kind of just try to keep everything together."
"00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,180","And that way I'm able to do some more idea stuff."
"00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,739","'Cause even now the way it's going, like I don't think, I mean, like even this way"
"00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,211","I don't think I'd be able to do all these paintings in four months."
"00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,580","Seventy paintings by myself, anyway, you know."
"00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:43,592","Well, at least if we're going to say like this is Bagel's style game, then I would, yeah, at least I would have a little bit more like yeah,"
"00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,579","you know, that is my stuff. You know."
"00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,860","Instead of like, ah, it's like an awesome Peter Chan drawing or something, you know, that I colored."
"00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,178","Why don't we like finish off this sprint until the end of the month, right."
"00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,665","I'll try to get all this cloud things going."
"00:26:00,665 --> 00:26:05,776","Petty: But I think it's a tougher thing where that if we come up with a sketch of a plan that we think might work,"
"00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,782","then I think we should try it sooner than later, 'cause fuck a sprint."
"00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:10,066","Who cares? I don't care."
"00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:11,666","There's no publisher fucking us in the ass over it."
"00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:17,029","Like with just the whole point is, it's just there to like be milestones as we make this game, right?"
"00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:23,404","So if we, you know, as long we're meeting Tim's goals for the project, as long as we think we can actually get it done"
"00:26:23,404 --> 00:26:29,104","and as long as we're all willing to give it a shot, there's no reason in the world we shouldn't be flexible. Right."
"00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,960","Stapley: I think it was because really when it first started, it was going to be like $300,000"
"00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,680","and we're going to just try to do some retro Day of the Tentacle shit, you know."
"00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,020","And I know things change so much from the beginning of this Kickstarter thing, you know."
"00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,187","And I know now it's huge, it's a big thing, which is great."
"00:26:49,187 --> 00:26:50,785","And it's awesome."
"00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,260","But, I think we can work it out somehow."
"00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,244","Schafer: You know, right now Bagel's been doing a lot of painting, which is not necessarily, I can see where that would feel like,"
"00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:05,079","you're just like doing a coloring book or paint-by-numbers."
"00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,780","Those are just my terms, not his."
"00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,837","Stapley: I don't know."
"00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,940","I don't even know how it's going to turn out."
"00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,740","It might turn out totally different."
"00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,960","I'm just kind of glad I got it off my chest, that's all."
"00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,820","Schafer: Yeah, I think his coming out here in person is what allowed him to open up about that."
"00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,832","I think he's over Skype."
"00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,220","It's hard to really talk about, how you're feeling."
"00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,420","Stapley: I'm glad I said it, because I was all worried about it."
"00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,308","So I think so."
"00:27:34,308 --> 00:27:36,868","I think we're going to try to start doing that."
"00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,924","Schafer: Like I'll feel a lot better once we made one of something."
"00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:46,552","Like once, 'cause I was feeling like we had not yet accomplished, the game was looking good and coming along, right."
"00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:53,911","But we'd not yet accomplished that thing of seeing something in the playable version of the game that had that crazy Bagel-style yet."
"00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:59,840","Like the special element of like surrealism or just kind of dream logic that his paintings might have."
"00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,940","I hadn't yet seen in the game yet."
"00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,581","So once we have something like that in the game, I'll be like, OK, great."
"00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,900","We just need to do that a whole bunch of times then I'll feel a lot more relaxed."
"00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,180","But until you achieve that, there's always this question of like will you be able to achieve what you want to do."
"00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:19,039","You know, it's tricky, 'cause you got to make, get the game to look the way you want it to look,"
"00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,480","but also get done on time with the people that you have and also all those people have to be happy."
"00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,478","Yeah, like you're trying to get people to contribute their whole selfs to the project."
"00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,020","So that's challenging."
"00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:36,306","But it's what I spent the most of my time recently, like the last ten years recently, like doing, like trying to solve that problem."
"00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:44,771","How to make a group of people work well together and bring the best ideas forth and make good stuff together."
