"00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:34,904","Rice: Last week was, I think, the Kickstarter update went out."
"00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:41,505","So that went over really well and there's a lot of comments about how we all looked really sad in that episode."
"00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:43,693","Schafer: Cheer up, you guys!"
"00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:49,398","Petty: There were a couple random cuts of me going; that had nothing to do with what was being said."
"00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:53,343","Rice: It just meant that a lot of people came out of the woodwork that were like, don't be sad, we love the game."
"00:00:53,343 --> 00:00:54,466","And don't listen to the haters."
"00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:56,879","Kipnis: Wait, wait. Can you send this link to us?"
"00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,697","Rice: Yeah. If you looked at forum threads, the main forum threads."
"00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:02,897","Schafer: What did you do last week?"
"00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:08,221","Fish: Face it, baby. You're hooked on me."
"00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:11,060","It's even funnier in the game, you guys."
"00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,387","Rice: Spoiler. Schafer: Spoilers."
"00:01:13,387 --> 00:01:42,004","[Music] Schafer: I really am trying everything to make sure the game comes out this year."
"00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:46,610","Rice: It's just going in knowing that that would mean like doing whatever it takes to make that happen."
"00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,014","And sacrificing in some ways."
"00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:50,411","Schafer: I think we can do December."
"00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,331","To me, it's like an infinity far away."
"00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:53,895","Schafer: There's like backer expectations."
"00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:55,725","There is a financial."
"00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:58,186","And for me, just the possibility of actually being up for awards."
"00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:03,496","It's really just the best game that we can make and we feel like we can actually make without crashing the company into the ground."
"00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:08,787","Rice: And so I guess on the screen right now is the current timeline for production on Act Two."
"00:02:08,787 --> 00:02:13,828","This is what we're working towards and this was the attempt to get to a December launch."
"00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:24,600","So like even this is stuff that is a real challenge and a lot of people feel, on the team, it's going to take everything, everyone firing like on all cylinders."
"00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,530","Everything falling into the right places."
"00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,800","But seems doable with a push."
"00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:38,299","And so that is the other challenge, is that all of this requires like our team coming back and working in full, having writing ready to go."
"00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:40,321","Schafer: On Broken Age? OK, Broken Age."
"00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:42,290","We have people coming back."
"00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,941","Ray's coming back. Crook: Tomorrow."
"00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:45,223","Schafer: You're typing something."
"00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:46,411","You're on Facebook over there."
"00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:47,696","Crook: Just with my eyes."
"00:02:47,696 --> 00:02:48,975","Schafer: Facebooking."
"00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:50,554","Ray's coming back tomorrow."
"00:02:50,554 --> 00:02:51,845","And Rusty's been back."
"00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:55,469","Anna's been wiring up actual puzzles in Act Two, right?"
"00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:57,439","Crook: Here we go."
"00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,781","Offscreen Voice: Been a while?"
"00:02:58,781 --> 00:03:01,071","Crook: Deja vu. That's good."
"00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:05,620","It's good to be back on, back in the world of Shay and Vella."
"00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:16,489","So I took, took a little time off away from it, not off Double Fine, but just away from the Broken Age and helped out on a couple of other projects."
"00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:22,729","And that was great, because it was just totally different and just a new, it was a nice break."
"00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:24,498","Schafer: Wow, the team is big again."
"00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:25,609","Look at that."
"00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:27,443","And Oliver's working."
"00:03:27,443 --> 00:03:34,421","Franzke: We're implementing puzzles and scenes are getting drawn and like sample scripts are getting written, so it's, it's pretty good."
"00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:39,584","We got Ben back now as well on the project, which is good, exactly."
"00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:45,211","Peck: Wow. That was a roller coaster, like now we're going to have to do the whole thing over again in less time."
"00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:49,516","Kipnis: Yeah, I guess at this point it's one of these things where we know that we'll be able to do the game."
"00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:54,365","The matter will be to the standard that we have in Act One, like that's not a risk however."
"00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:56,313","That's not a concern that we have."
"00:03:56,313 --> 00:04:00,757","But we just like, now it's like OK, can we do this in a few months?"
"00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:05,198","And we'll see."
"00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:11,757","Hansen: Yeah, we worked through a lot of the kinks that we experienced during the Act One, so it's really just about pure execution at this point."
"00:04:11,757 --> 00:04:16,343","Petty: This wouldn't stay here, but if you had like everything on, so they kind of don't overlap each other"
"00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:19,122","but they all add up versus like this stuff."
"00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:20,267","Schafer: Cool. That's neat."
"00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:24,597","Petty: Since it's the only thing that's really changed, hopefully it becomes like the player knows it's a focal point, you know."
"00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,828","They know they need to keep going back, 'cause it's different."
"00:04:27,828 --> 00:04:34,360","Peck: I'm pretty excited about how much of the tech we already have in place and we can just like hit the ground running on"
"00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,892","just writing up the game play and stuff like that."
"00:04:36,892 --> 00:04:43,145","Crook: So that maybe makes it a little less exciting, in a way, just because it's not new."
"00:04:43,145 --> 00:04:50,199","As far as figuring things out, but it also makes you less nervous, you know, 'cause we know, OK, it worked."
"00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,395","And you know, there's a few things we want to change."
"00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:55,152","Crook: We really need to work on the flip book interface."
"00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:57,196","It's not very intuitive."
"00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,389","Another thing."
"00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:05,180","Is there any way, Oliver, I know we've mentioned this in the past, but faster exporting of anims from Maya? Yeah."
"00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:09,980","It's just, you know, it's just these, this, we have a lot of big scenes."
"00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,920","Tim writes long scenes and they, and you make one change, you test it like, ahh, OK, that's good."
"00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,280","Then you got to re-export again, that's another ten, fifteen minutes."
"00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,719","Franzke: I mean, one thing I'm interested to investigate is whether we could launch Maya in batch mode somehow"
"00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:24,927","and like execute a script on it."
"00:05:24,927 --> 00:05:26,887","Petty: I would if we have a network machine that does it."
"00:05:26,887 --> 00:05:31,774","Just like when, you know, in Brutal Legend we eventually stopped doing local exports of the movie"
"00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,135","and started having the build machine to do it, yeah."
"00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:40,142","It would also help if we didn't have, you know, seven year old machines with only 4 gigs of RAM."
"00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:44,010","So it could be fixed by, you know, I don't know."
"00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,029","Crook: Greg. Buy all new computers."
"00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:49,131","Crook: So it'll, it'll just make workflow easier."
"00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:54,331","I think it'll save us a lot of time in bug fixing."
"00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,872","Petty: You know, I noticed that there are a lot of animation bugs as the production went on."
"00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,200","And some of those, a lot of those boil down to like sorting issues."
"00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,360","Crook: Basically one piece of geometry didn't know whether it should sort in front or in back of another piece of geometry."
"00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:16,000","Petty: The way we've done sorting to support all the platforms is limited and they spend a lot of time cleaning that up."
"00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,259","Like if we knew that we were only making it for a high-end console ever, we'd probably have had different solutions"
"00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:26,959","that would have removed some of the burden off the animators or artists, but you know, when you're developing a new engine and you're supporting"
"00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,520","a really wide array of platforms, you can't really do that."
"00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,140","Or at least it's harder."
"00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:35,045","Franzke: Yeah, gosh."
"00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,560","Petty: What do you think, Oliver?"
"00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,380","This is way more fun that fixing compatibility errors."
"00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:45,600","Rice: Yep. So I mean, Ben, you're on some stuff now and I guess a lot of this would be coming your way."
"00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,600","Franzke: How do you feel about crunching?"
"00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:55,238","Petty: I mean it's always a balance for every engine I've been on, 'cause all the games I've worked on I've never used commercial licensed engines."
"00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,440","They've always been developed in-house."
"00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:04,240","So there's always this balance between getting the game done and adding tools to make making the game more effective."
"00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,180","And it's really hard to know where that balance should be."
"00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,780","Petty: I guess I just wanted to mention that there's a ball of work potentially to like fix some of the workflows that got broken"
"00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:17,140","and also improve some things that I never got a chance to improve, to try and also make the content production of Act Two as efficient as possible."
"00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,600","Franzke: Like, this, this, this schedule to some degree also relies in effect just like in Act One"
"00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:32,840","we actually have some manpower available to fix and even possibly improve the workflow, which is right now really bad,"
"00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,540","because it just bi-rotted all alway because nobody had time to really look at it."
"00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,280","Like opening scenes takes insane amount of time, nobody really knows why."
"00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,080","I don't have time to look into it."
"00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,520","Nobody has, Anna needs to work."
"00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,220","We only have two programmers."
"00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:47,896","Rice: If we're worried about December, that seems like that's going to be something that makes it even more challenging."
"00:07:47,896 --> 00:07:52,295","Petty: Just something to throw in the bucket with the rest of it."
"00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:59,320","Petty: And so we're, we're going to a more traditional production cycle now, trying to actually build the very specific game assets,"
"00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,558","not just design them, you know."
"00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:02,377","Preproduction way."
"00:08:02,377 --> 00:08:07,097","And we're finishing our first sprint of Act Two."
"00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:23,380","[Music] Schafer: This is the first time we've played through since we started Act Two."
"00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,200","Kipnis: Although I need to make sure that the sound is actually working."
"00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,440","Last time on Broken Age."
"00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,693","Schafer: Are we going to have that?"
"00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,240","Oh my God. OK. Here we go."
"00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,240","This better not fucking end here!"
"00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,900","It better not be the end!"
"00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:45,060","I paid $15 for, what?"
"00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:51,658","Pull on, OK."
"00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,640","Ohmygod is it going to go right into it? Awesome."
"00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,140","That's so nice and smooth."
"00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:04,140","So when you play through the game, the only thing is like, do you think we should still put the text up, like ""end of Act One""?"
"00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,740","Kipnis: No, no, no. It should just go right in."
"00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,900","Schafer: You guys seem to have already come to an agreement about this one."
"00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,500","Kipnis: I mean we could, but it wouldn't be as..."
"00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,600","Schafer: Should I pick the girl?"
"00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,760","Kipnis: No. Don't do it."
"00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:18,127","Petty: It'd be a very short play through."
"00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,400","Schafer: It's like, oh no! Horrible bug."
"00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,354","Kipnis: He needs a runs."
"00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,660","Petty: You know what I realized, too, is Shay's in all these scenes."
"00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,880","He feels a bit small in all of them."
"00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,740","He's the correct scale, but he's actually, he's so much smaller feeling than Vella."
"00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,300","Their height is about the same, but because she has the bigger hair and a wider face."
"00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:49,940","Like he looks small talking to the same characters as if you, like when you just, and I've doubled, triple checked the scale and it's all correct."
"00:09:49,954 --> 00:09:54,154","It just, Kipnis: I wonder if we should make him bigger."
"00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,120","Petty: Well, it'd throw off all the stuff at this point."
"00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,700","Schafer: So I assume, I think Lydia is awkward."
"00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,400","She came 'cause I think she thinks this is like, yeah, a surprise going away party."
"00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,520","She's coming, is this where, is this where the cake is, you guys?"
"00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,400","Is this where we're having the big going away?"
"00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,040","This is Lydia's last play-through before she goes to..."
"00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,360","That's Oculus. That's my gesture for Oculus."
"00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,057","Facehugger."
"00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,114","Anyone have any last words for Lydia?"
"00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,640","Petty: Thank you for all your hard work, Lydia."
"00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,600","[Applause] Kipnis: All your v-effects in Act One were amazing"
"00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,340","and we hope we get somebody anywhere near as good as you for Act Two."
"00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,500","Crook: Yeah. Yeah, that was unfortunate."
"00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,320","Good old Lydia."
"00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,960","The turnover here is very, is not high."
"00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,020","It's actually, it's not high at all."
"00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:53,660","And I think sometimes we're lucky to have people for as long as we do."
"00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,360","And it is a little scary, like we were talking about effects today, a little bit."
"00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,860","Then I was, you know, and then in the back of your head, like wait."
"00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,039","Who's going to do these?"
"00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,300","I know Lee was doing a little bit of effects work the other day, but he's not going to have time to like, be the effects person."
"00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,640","So I'm just going to have to trust that they can find somebody."
"00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,640","'Cause we do have, we have a couple other effects artists, but they're on other projects."
"00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:26,700","So we're going to have to find somebody new that can come in and try and match that style and we will, we will."
"00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,480","And so, so we'll find somebody that can do it."
"00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,380","So I'm not freaking out, but I don't know."
"00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,320","She was great."
"00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,060","Schafer: OK. But it's awesome."
"00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,780","See those puzzles coming together. Kipnis: Yeah."
"00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,800","Schafer: We'll be done by December!"
"00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,080","Rice: Exactly. Petty: It's nice that you know when..."
"00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:47,642","Schafer: This is where everyone jumps out and is like, yeah!"
"00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:55,900","Schafer: People were worried about it being done in December, earlier and then the writing is taking even a little bit longer than we thought."
"00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,460","So I bet people were even more worried about it being done in December."
"00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,160","Schafer: But we did not quite finish the work, the milestone and when we started the milestone"
"00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,160","we're like, from now on if we don't finish milestones we're just going to cut stuff and when we don't finish them."
"00:12:08,163 --> 00:12:13,360","And the milestone, so I guess we're just going to have to cut half of those puzzles."
"00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,000","So we're going to go back to that meeting we had where we said that we're going to cut stuff and be like, OK, listen."
"00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,940","It's not totally reasonable to just cut stuff that doesn't get done."
"00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,260","We're going to just have to make up for it somehow."
"00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,260","Petty: The intent was never to be, oh, we didn't finish that puzzle."
"00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,416","We're just not doing it."
"00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:37,220","It was, it was that we didn't want to leave a wake of unfinished, half-implemented puzzles for a variety of reasons"
"00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,200","and one was you can't play-test a half-implemented puzzle meaningfully."
"00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,240","And we wanted to play-test sooner to help ameliorate the amount of like play-tested adjustments at the end"
"00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,540","when we have less flexibility, 'cause the dialogue's recorded and we're running out of time."
"00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,340","So I mean, it's all those reasons why we're trying to do that."
"00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,540","But what actually wound up happening for a couple reasons was that we didn't hit those two puzzles."
"00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:03,880","So we're effectively, I don't know, a week or so behind already on the schedule in our first two-week sprint."
"00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:10,740","And it's going to continue, like we'll continue to get further behind unless we can close out puzzles on that sprint."
"00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,880","And I don't see anything that changes that."
"00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,620","Right now, for example, there's really only one puzzle that's finished writing."
"00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,680","We can't finish the hull patch puzzle chain, because it's missing writing."
"00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,240","We can't finish the hexapal wiring, we can't finish radiation suit."
"00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,200","So that still means we're behind."
"00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,580","Schafer: ok."
"00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,980","Hansen: Would that allow us to potentially catch up, if we got the writing in time?"
"00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:39,160","Schafer: So I bet I'm maybe the last person who thinks we can get it done in December, probably."
"00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:44,820","You can kind of sense when you're in a position where everyone kind of thinks you're not going to make the deadline, but they just haven't told you yet."
"00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:52,040","So I'm going to go ahead and pretend I haven't heard it yet until they, it's just too much time has gone by, they can't tell me."
"00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,640","Then they won't tell me."
"00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,800","And then we'll make it on time, see?"
"00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,420","That's how I operate."
"00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,536","Kind of mind games."
"00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,393","Hansen: There're two different scenarios that we can do pretty much."
"00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,960","Well, one is we don't ship in December."
"00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,980","I mean, that's probably the one we don't want to go for."
"00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,220","And the other one, basically eats into Beta periods so that we won't have a true Beta."
"00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:21,640","We would actually have animations and v-effects and a lot of the audio stuff coming in late, like into Beta."
"00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,980","And there's a lot of risk involved in doing that."
"00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,080","So that was something that we were trying to avoid."
"00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:34,500","Rice: Then it's like getting the writing done so we can have a VO session in time to where we get the files back soon enough to get our animators"
"00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,400","pumping through that from Super Genius, but also so it's not late,"
"00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,660","too late to where we're screwing audio and the effects guys."
"00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,300","So there's just kind of a balance in there."
"00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:50,240","Hansen: We presented Tim with a really aggressive schedule for delivering the writing that we needed in order to keep the team on schedule."
"00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:56,820","And it was requiring him to work at a faster pace than he's ever written on the projects up to this point."
"00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,880","It's a challenge for everybody, but it all starts with the writings."
"00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,000","Annable: So Tim, did you see the email that I sent you where I said I just did this little exercise."
"00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,940","Schafer: Yeah, I deleted that one immediately."
"00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,880","It was terrifying."
"00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,158","That was the one where you were like..."
"00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,340","it looks he spent a year writing this first one, so..."
"00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:21,577","Annable: No, no. And it's, no. 'Cause you didn't take a year; you spent like 13 weeks and to me, you know, we don't,"
"00:15:21,577 --> 00:15:24,997","we don't really succeed when we say hey, Tim, write faster."
"00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,998","It's kind of an impossible thing to do."
"00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:36,500","So for me, I just don't see December as a, as a reality."
"00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:43,720","Rice: So I don't know if we want to make a call now or if we want to say let's try to write the rest of the game"
"00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,540","in four and a half weeks and still squeeze it in."
"00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,360","Annable: I just worry about the quality then."
"00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:58,380","I mean, because even if he, Tim, even if you locked yourself away and wrote for a month, you know, I mean that's a lot of pressure."
"00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,840","Schafer: Mmhmm."
"00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,560","Annable: I mean, Tim, do you think you can do that?"
"00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,400","Schafer: Again I don't see a lot of choice."
"00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,780","Annable: I mean, it'll be a gnarly schedule for everybody."
"00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:19,560","Hansen: All right. So why don't we create those scenarios and then we can share the, once this group, and we can talk about it from there."
"00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,520","Schafer: Well, I better get writing. Rice: Yeah."
"00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,360","Annable: All right. Whoohoo! You can do it, Tim. You can do it."
"00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,700","Schafer: OK. Annable: OK."
"00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,800","Schafer: All right. Thanks for talking."
"00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,720","I wish I had more easy solutions for everybody."
"00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,420","Annable: Bye, guys. Schafer: Bye."
"00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,040","Rice: Hi, Malena. OK."
"00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:42,304","I'm getting Bagel, too."
"00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:43,384","We'll see if he comes."
"00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,380","Tim is not coming today, you guys."
"00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,280","Kipnis: Why not?"
"00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,260","Rice: He is in his office with a big sticker that says ""Do Not Disturb""."
"00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,120","Melena says."
"00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,220","So he's writing."
"00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,200","No, he's actually, he's been killing it."
"00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,160","He's been cranking through stuff really quick."
"00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,280","I think he sees the deadlines looming and is staying really on top of stuff."
"00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,999","So I think if he keeps going at this pace, then yeah, we're going to have a good shot at it."
"00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,599","Yeah, he's doing his best and it's coming in really nice."
"00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,960","It's solid now, so it's good to see."
"00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,560","Schafer: As long as we can survive 'til the end of the project, it'll be great."
"00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,080","I guess I gotta finish my dialog before..."
"00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,559","You guys get to talk to me ever again."
"00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,200","Schafer: Out. Out!"
"00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,080","Just kidding."
"00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,920","Come in any time you want to."
"00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,320","Is that a good enough ending?"
"00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,040","I'll do like this."
"00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,000","I guess it's just another day in games."
"00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,060","Schafer: Right, right?"
"00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,140","I can close my door and I can put a Post-it note on it and I can even lock it."
"00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,080","But just walking around the office, people will be like, ah, I need you to talk, I need to talk to you about this thing."
"00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,720","And then that thing spins into another thing."
"00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,220","And someone wants to talk about another thing."
"00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:06,380","So many projects going on, so many deals that I probably should be helping with and you know, they justifiably need some input or something."
"00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,720","But I just have to get this writing done."
"00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,120","I just have to get this writing done."
"00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,680","So everything else in the company's got to, got to operate on its own for a little while."
"00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,740","Schafer: We're here at the Noe Valley Public Library."
"00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,520","My house is a few blocks down that way."
"00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,900","I've come to libraries ever since trying to design Full Throttle."
"00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,271","I remember going down to the Sausalito Library and sitting there and designing."
"00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,559","Sitting there with my notebook, same exact thing."
"00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,900","And Grim I went to the library a lot."
"00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:42,140","I actually did a lot of research in the library, just 'cause the Internet was not full of stuff as it is now."
"00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:44,408","It's also nice to get out of the office."
"00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,076","It's a change of scenery."
"00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,800","I used to think like, on Full Throttle, I went to the library and I got so much done on the first day."
"00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,260","I was like, this is great, this is my new secret."
"00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,980","And then I went down the next day and I didn't get any work done."
"00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,980","It was like, what's going on?"
"00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,460","And I got a lot of work done in the office."
"00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,560","And then sometimes I get a lot of work done in my home."
"00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,560","And sometimes I think there's no one answer."
"00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,680","You just have to keep moving around and shuffling around."
"00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,640","And I think in the end it really in some ways doesn't matter."
"00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,074","You just have to like work at it every day and some days you get nothing done, some days you get a lot done."
"00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,800","But you have to do it every day."
"00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:25,464","[Music] Schafer: Yeah, it's coming along really fast."
"00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,524","I mean, they really are working twice as fast as Act One."
"00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,500","And we don't have everyone that we had in Act One."
"00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,380","Remember in Act One we had like JP and Brandon, all these people."
"00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:40,040","This one's been on the gameplay side just like Anna and Ben cranking away on it."
"00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:51,120","[Music] Rice: There's certain puzzles we should make sure to hit first."
"00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,840","Petty: I think we should hit the stuff that we played the least first, which is the radiation suit puzzle."
"00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,280","I would do that one first. Rice: Cool."
"00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,080","Schafer: Sprint kickoff."
"00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,500","I missed the play-through but I heard it was good."
"00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,760","Rice: The play-through was awesome."
"00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,260","Did anybody have anything they wanted to say about it?"
"00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,860","Schafer: It was particularly awesome because I wasn't here."
"00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,420","Like everyone's like, it seems so relaxed."
"00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,060","Petty: That was like a plus."
"00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:10,061","Schafer: Why is it so chill here?"
"00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:11,041","I don't know what's going on."
"00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,760","Petty: I mean, I think it was pretty solid."
"00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:20,980","I mean, the puzzles were, they became clear in the play-through that the puzzles were a lot more complex than the first act, which was cool."
"00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:22,640","Game Tester: This is a good puzzle."
"00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,880","I have no idea what's going on."
"00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,974","It's going to be hard."
"00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:30,654","You need a pen there, Ben?"
"00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,380","Peck: Yeah, I got one."
"00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:37,960","Petty: Because there are more steps in them and the puzzles, a lot of them aren't just say using an object in a place,"
"00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,620","but there's some trial and error things you can manipulate and see different results."
"00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,593","I think the separate puzzle chains kind of weave in and out of each other."
"00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,880","So I think that, that's where some of the, I think some people would describe that as difficulty,"
"00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,260","which is true but I think it's also just the appearance."
"00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:59,074","And, and actual complexity that was maybe missing from some of the puzzles in the first act."
"00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,240","And part of that was by design, both to ramp it up."
"00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,327","But also, you know, Tim, I think in both cases from a story standpoint or from a theme standpoint,"
"00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:11,960","the character's kind of start constrained and therefore the player's kind of constrained."
"00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,640","And they kind of break out of that constraint."
"00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:21,120","And that means that it was just a little more, there wasn't much opportunity for the puzzles to kind of weave back and forth through each other."
"00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:23,460","Kipnis: So what are your thoughts, you guys?"
"00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,940","Rice: It's fucking awesome. So good."
"00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,580","Kipnis: It's really long. Peck: Yeah."
"00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,415","Rice: It's super fun."
"00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,520","Peck: I really love that last puzzle. Rice: Yeah."
"00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:40,500","I think it's just like for my level it feels like what we're hoping, which is like much less linear and spread out"
"00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,140","and you're having to really kind of retrace your steps a lot."
"00:21:44,143 --> 00:21:46,073","Petty: So I just realized a flaw, though, right."
"00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:54,273","Like if you are playing the girl and you take her all the way to the end of her chain, and you haven't seen the [spoiler-bleep]"
"00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,320","'cause they're not part of, we have to make sure they're part of her critical puzzle that you have to see them."
"00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,396","Because I'm thinking about this now."
"00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:05,820","You finished him and you didn't hear [spoiler-bleep], which is what she will need to solve the [spoiler-bleep]"
"00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,020","because it's not critical path."
"00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,960","And there's no way to go back to it, 'cause you're in a scrolling thing."
"00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,740","Rice: And yeah, same with him, same with her where if you've gone all the way through and saw it"
"00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,740","and just didn't notice it and then now you don't remember the pattern."
"00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,420","Petty: Well, and this one is specifically, you have to be able to go and test it."
"00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,853","And once we put you in this mode, you can never go back."
"00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,240","Peck: Yeah. Petty: So I'm not sure how we solve that."
"00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,760","Rice: That's a good question for Tim."
"00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,600","Schafer: Oh, this is, I feel like this might be a horrible thing I don't want to think about."
"00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,100","Petty: Yeah, we're not really sure what to do about this."
"00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:32,535","Schafer: It's just, you have that, it works in play-test."
"00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:35,875","Petty: No! Rice: It doesn't work."
"00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,540","Schafer: Now we've made it so that you, Vella and Shay need each other, like you need things from both areas to work in the other areas."
"00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,560","And we did that on purpose, but then we forget, well, we didn't forget."
"00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:53,218","We just failed to remember that you can play one character completely and then like in the first act,"
"00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,860","you could play all of Shay and then go play all of Vella or vice versa."
"00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,620","And since we made them interdependent, we thought that wasn't a problem."
"00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:04,620","But if you shut down this whole character and go into that looping animation that means their act is done,"
"00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,000","you can't find the things you need to solve this one."
"00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,600","So we're just going to leave that in the unfixable state."
"00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,800","People will be just be like, how far did you get in Broken Age before you couldn't play anymore?"
"00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,780","And there'll be like a leader board."
"00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,640","More challenge."
"00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:17,747","No more hand holding."
"00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,800","I just haven't figured out a solution to that yet."
"00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,180","It's not going to be pretty."
"00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:31,700","Schafer: Instead of going into the end state where looping, if you haven't solved one of those puzzles, they go into these other states."
"00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,000","Basically stalling."
"00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:39,060","Rice: At that point it does feel like it's kind of closing people off and a bit handhold-y."
"00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,580","I don't know. Yeah."
"00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,360","Schafer: OK, So we acknowledge that that is a horrible problem for Ben to solve."
"00:23:51,220 --> 00:24:00,580","Petty: That we're trying to introduce some, more than just story relationships between the separate characters."
"00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:09,780","And since we've only really taken Shay's second act to Alpha, the exact solution for how to kind of play on those"
"00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:14,480","and that gameplay impact isn't really obvious until we develop more of Vella's side of things."
"00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,900","Rice: I'm really happy with Alpha on the section we just did."
"00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:24,460","And I don't know, the rest of development is super tight if we're still trying to get December."
"00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:31,600","And I think that everybody really wants to make it happen so I think that if we can keep pushing forward it should be,"
"00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,440","at least we got a shot right now."
"00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,540","I think a lot of it's going to come down to like this next month and a half is really important."
"00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,480","In three, four weeks we'll see where the writing is and hopefully if things look good"
"00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,800","we can rally behind it and push to make it happen."
"00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,600","Crook: I don't know. December."
"00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,960","What are we in, October?"
"00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,260","November, yeah, no."
"00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,240","That's not going to happen."
"00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,060","As far as I can tell."
"00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,760","But we do not, I have not heard another date."
"00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:08,258","That's the only date I've heard, but I just think that there's, there's too much work, I think."
"00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:15,980","As far as I can tell, there's way too much work, but that's kind of up to the producers to figure that out."
"00:25:16,298 --> 00:25:42,273","[Music] Schafer: The puzzles are great, the writing is late."
"00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:47,140","But I've been getting some more done, so everybody shut up."
"00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,050","Rice: Like we're just not moving at the pace that that timeline has us moving at."
"00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,180","And now that we're getting more and more writing, we're having a better idea of what it's looking like, too."
"00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:09,600","But yeah, I think that the conversation of December is still conversation that's happening and one that needs to probably be had further, soon."
"00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,960","'Cause this is another sprint of like pushing stuff off into the next sprint as we have been."
"00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,320","Kipnis: The problem with Vella's side is that there are a lot of like mechanical or physical puzzles"
"00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,720","that are like, I don't know if it's going to communicate what we want."
"00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,540","Like I don't know if it's going to work exactly like how we expect."
"00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,799","I just, I worry about the deadline."
"00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:34,440","Rice: I think it's true, I just don't know if it's going to be able to, if it's going to be able to affect the timing or the VO sessions and stuff."
"00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,940","'Cause otherwise we're pushing it off to where Camden seemed to get dropped with a bunch of stuff and..."
"00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,535","Petty: That sounds like the perfect solution to me."
"00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,860","Rice: Well, and Ray and the animators are just, yeah, going to be looking for stuff."
"00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,620","Crook: Effects artist..."
"00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,480","Schafer: Push him a little farther until he gets grumpy.."
"00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,880","Petty: Oh the effects artist we're going to hire."
"00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,460","Schafer: Still trying to make December."
"00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,912","I mean a lot of it's hard for people to commit to something being done on a certain date if a lot of things are unknown."
"00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,280","Like we don't know what the final act is going to look like."
"00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:10,460","And like I can see it, but if they don't know exactly what all the assets are going to be, it's hard for them to say it will be done by December."
"00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,500","But I still feel good about it."
"00:27:14,672 --> 00:27:20,920","Schafer: I, I think I found it and brought it in and left it as a gift for my producers."
"00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,320","Just to give them something I could never actually give them in real life."
"00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,560","I mean, if we're not done in December, we'd definitely be done in January, that's the thing."
"00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,987","So it just seems like so close, like why miss it."
"00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,757","Schafer: I finally finished the Act Two girl dialogue, so the spaceship dialogue is done,"
"00:27:34,757 --> 00:27:37,637","which is exciting for me personally, thank you, Anna."
"00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,120","Yeah, it's between us."
"00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,218","It's really important."
"00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,880","So now I'm just writing, I just to have to write the finale, which looks like this."
"00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,420","Had a lot of spoilers right there."
"00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,332","Don't film that part."
"00:27:51,332 --> 00:27:52,419","Schafer: I got to finish."
"00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:57,100","I'm so close to being done with the dialogue for the game, which would be a huge milestone in my life,"
"00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,960","'cause all I can think about is dialogue for this game."
"00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,080","There's a lot of dialogue in this game."
"00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,240","Offscreen Voice: So why are you standing up?"
"00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,760","Schafer: I'm standing up 'cause I had my gall bladder out."
"00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,420","I'm trying to act cool so people don't know that I had it out, but I don't like to sit down,"
"00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:14,260","'cause if I fold the part where they cut me open and take it out, it kind of hurts."
"00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,697","But that was on Friday."
"00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,500","And now it's Monday, I'm fine."
"00:28:17,503 --> 00:28:21,755","It's no big deal, gall bladders are stupid, overrated."
"00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,780","Offscreen Voice: Is that because of the juice diet?"
"00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:26,700","Schafer: No one knows if it was because of the juice diet or not."
"00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:34,914","Like some people, the doctor said it's just genetic and you're just prone to having gall bladders, gall bladder stones, gallstones."
"00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,620","But my wife is sure it's the juice diet."
"00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,891","Offscreen Voice: So no more juice?"
"00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:40,949","Schafer: I don't know."
"00:28:40,949 --> 00:28:41,769","This has been a long project."
"00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:45,117","I've been through many bodily changes through this project."
"00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,320","Stress. It's probably just stress, games gonna kill me."
"00:28:48,964 --> 00:28:51,136","Oh, my tush is going to hurt."
"00:28:51,136 --> 00:28:53,581","I'm going to sit. I have to sit down."
"00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:56,508","That pen's a goner, 'cause I can't go down there and get it."
"00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:50,980","[Music] Schafer: Last week we went to PAX, that was awesome."
"00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,352","We didn't do a bunch of Broken Age stuff 'cause Broken Age is all stealth, Since we're showing the other games."
"00:29:55,352 --> 00:29:56,692","Rice: A lot of people asked about it, though."
"00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,860","Schafer: A lot of people asked about it, a lot of people said they loved Part One."
"00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,360","Rice: Exactly. Schafer: And that was nice."
"00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,794","Rice: I actually had a lot of people say don't make it harder."
"00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,395","That was like the comment and feedback I got."
"00:30:05,395 --> 00:30:08,118","Schafer: Shit. Kipnis: Well, it's too late now."
"00:30:08,118 --> 00:30:11,278","Rice: Yeah, they're all talking about how they like to play with their kids and how it's a too great experience."
"00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,454","So, something to keep in mind."
"00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,400","Petty: It's a generational game."
"00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:22,520","[Garbled noises] Rice: Creepy."
