"00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,704","Schafer: Hi, guys. How's it going?"
"00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,406",This is the last one of these we'll ever do?
"00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,607",Offscreen: Yeah.
"00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:45,546","Schafer: Seems like only yesterday I was saying all that stuff, sitting in this chair"
"00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,248","that I can't remember now, 'cause it's been so long ago."
"00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,550","Offscreen: Mm-hmm, we talked about that initial budget in that chair."
"00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,552",Schafer: Don't bring that up.
"00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:00,594","[Laughter] Yeah, it's just-- it's this one,"
"00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,296","and then it's, ahh!"
"00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:30,590","[Music] Schafer: Tonight, we are going to have a bonfire down at the beach"
"00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,461","to celebrate the completion of ""Broken Age,"" everybody."
"00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,164",[Applause] Yay!
"00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,532",Teamwork!
"00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:41,368","It started out like a really fun idea, and then it got really hard."
"00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:45,505","And a bunch of people wussed out, but a lot of people stuck around to the end."
"00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:52,079","I wanna thank you, thank you to the whole team, and thank you everybody."
"00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,513",We're done!
"00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:57,851","Like, we went to the beach, we had that party, things got a little out of control."
"00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:02,856","[Yelling] And it's fun, it's fun 'cause it's, like,"
"00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,591",not fixing things right at the last minute.
"00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:09,997","We kinda had it done in advance a little bit, at least for-- for me and us."
"00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,732","Like, it was, um, wrapped and submitted."
"00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:15,202","Like, we had to submit for the disc version, and that kind of actually-- it was tough,"
"00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:19,272","but it forced us to have a lot of stuff done before the, um, actual launch date,"
"00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,442",'cause we had to have that version burnt to disc.
"00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:28,448","And so, um...we had to time to kind of, like..."
"00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,584",adjust to the thought of it being over.
"00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,420","Um, so, Reds is done and it's awesome."
"00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,656",The end.
"00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,556",Rice: It's done?
"00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,591",Oh my God.
"00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,593",That's kinda sad.
"00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:44,765","We sent review keys out to press for ""Broken Age,"" so there's already, like, 10 or so folks"
"00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,767",that are playing for review.
"00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:50,570",With the amount of time that it's taken and the amount of things that have happened
"00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,840","in the last three years is, uh, staggering."
"00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,312","And, um, it was nice to see everyone care enough to push for a final product"
"00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,448",that could be something we're proud of.
"00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:04,718","Crook: Um, so yeah, it just, um, it kind of all came together at the end."
"00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:09,022",Um...so I feel good right now.
"00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,724",Offscreen: You feel good about it? Crook: Yeah.
"00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:14,661","I think it's beautiful, and something that we should be proud of."
"00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,064","Uh, I think people are gonna really like it."
"00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,332","Russell: Yes, we're finished."
"00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,301","See, I knew it would happen."
"00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:25,672","And after 13, 14 years here, you know stuff's gonna get done,"
"00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,575",and it'll be great in the end.
"00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,277",It'll be all worth it.
"00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,646",Schafer: Rusty. Russell: I'm playin' through and fixin' bugs.
"00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:33,780","Schafer: Well, thanks for playing."
"00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,215",Russell: Mostly playing. Schafer: Mm-hmm.
"00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,450",Awesome. What do you think so far?
"00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,617","Russell: I got confused, actually."
"00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,254",As much as I played through-- -I was-- Schafer: That's not good!
"00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,457","Rice: It's not a scripted cutscene, so you wouldn't know."
"00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,659","Russell: Yeah, exactly."
"00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:46,860","Schafer: Excellent, did you figure it out, or did ask for a hint?"
"00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,061",Russell: I had to ask Ray.
"00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,763",Schafer: Oh... -Oh...
"00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,032","And also, look, it's running on, uh, iPhone 6."
"00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,467",-Thanks... Rice: Not anymore.
"00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,469",Schafer: Not--b-but--it's a black screen.
"00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,737",Oliver!
"00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,805","Oh, spoilers for ""Act 2""!"
"00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,873",Okay.
"00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,508","Anyway, it's running."
"00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,376","Franzke: But, yeah."
"00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:08,115","As you can see, the game is running a little thing-- This one just crashed, but it does work."
"00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:11,718","I am extremely proud of, you know, the product the way it is right now."
"00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,555","Um...and, yeah, I hope it will stand the test of time."
"00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:20,493",Schafer: And then we are on the street on April 28th.
"00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,195",It'll be awesome.
"00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,564","Um, and Anna's alive."
"00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:25,632","Look at that, everybody."
"00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,400","Yay, Anna's alive!"
"00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,202",Yay!
"00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,637",Kipnis: It feels--it feels good.
"00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:35,842","It feels like, uh, we did-- we did something good and worthwhile"
"00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:41,848","and something that hopefully will, you know, uh, have a-- I don't know, a future?"
"00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,484","Like, have a legacy of some kind."
"00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:48,021","Schafer: I really, uh, felt good about the second chapter."
"00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,525","You know, I feel like it answered anyone's critique about the first one,"
"00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:54,628","you know, without changing the game completely, you know."
"00:04:54,628 --> 00:05:00,734","I think it definitely was, you know, harder and longer, and, um, and amazingly done in less time, so..."
"00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:07,274","Stoddard: I did my first full, full playthrough last weekend, and it is a hard game."
"00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:11,077",It's really challenging and it's really well-done and it's engaging.
"00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:16,149","Like, I've worked on this thing for years and I still-- like, the story was still getting me."
"00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,284",It's pretty good.
"00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:20,687","And when I hit the final scene, like, man, dude,"
"00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,622","it's, uh... it's cinematic."
"00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,624",It's like it hits you.
"00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,826",Definitely.
"00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,828",Um...so that felt good.
"00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,732",I just had to have a moment to...
"00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,467",start loving it again.
"00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,605","I mean, like, I had this point in here where, like, the love I have for this just kinda"
"00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,774",got knocked out for a few days.
"00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,475",And that was really scary.
"00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,277",That was really scary.
"00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,780","And, um..."
"00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,554",It was hard.
"00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,192",Schafer: We're going to our last stand-ups?
"00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,995",Is it last stand-ups?
"00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,663",I believe it is.
"00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,531","Hello, everybody."
"00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,500","Oh, look at the big-- Did we not get bagels for the final stand-ups?"
"00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,070","Crook: Ah, I didn't try."
"00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,205",Schafer: Come on! It's our last one.
"00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,807",Get your ass off Bagel.
"00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,509",I brought this for emotional support.
"00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,645",In case I get emotional.
"00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,347",Crook: Just keep hugging it. Schafer: I'm not gonna get emotional.
"00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,315","Crook: Squeezing it, hugging it. Schafer: I doubt it."
"00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,284",I doubt it. We're not done.
"00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,852",Are we? We done?
"00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,153",Crook: This is the last standup.
"00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,188",Schafer: You playing right now?
"00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,522",This game is so addictive.
"00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,191",Cannot put it down for one second.
"00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:38,498","Um...this might be-- this is our last proper standup for the full team, but, uh..."
"00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,500","don't worry, I won't give a speech or anything."
"00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,640","And then you always have this post-project depression, which is, like, you've defined yourself by who you are"
"00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,644","by making this game for so long, and then it's over and you're like, ""Who am I?"
"00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,013",Am I not the person who makes 'Broken Age'?
"00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:57,817","What am I? What's the point of it all?"" Crook: Before, when we were just doing, like, a big game,"
"00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:02,555","it would ship, and then the whole studio didn't have anything to do for a while."
"00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,826",And every--I think every-- the whole-- You could kinda feel that in the air
"00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:10,063",and it just kind of-- it was just-- it was kind of a downer.
"00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:13,433","And, uh, because there's multiple projects now, we can all just jump onto things,"
"00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:18,104","and that helps-- helps you, uh, I think helps me, get out of that."
"00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,374","And so that's why there was a need on ""Day of the Tentacle."""
"00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:25,645","Um, so now-- now I'm on to that."
"00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:29,015","Um, I'm--I hear it's really bad for people who are leading the project."
"00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,151","Uh, but Tim doesn't-- I mean, he doesn't show it."
"00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,386","He's pretty good with hiding, I think, his sadness."
"00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,455","But, um..."
"00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,856",He's just sad all the time.
"00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,058",No.
"00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,860","Uh, but I'm sure he-- I'm sure it will hit him, you know,"
"00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,065","because this is three years, uh, put into this."
"00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,232","Schafer: No, I don't get depressed."
"00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,702",I'm too old to get depressed.
"00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:53,406",Offscreen: Don't you have any sympathy for all the people that have been insisting the game will never finish?
"00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:57,243",Schafer: I do--I do feel bad for all the people who have based their identity
"00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,379",on the fact that I'll never finish this game.
"00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,482",'Cause we'll finish it and then they'll have post-project depression.
"00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,584","If I'm not that person who hates Tim Schafer, who am I?"
"00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,119",Excellent.
"00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,620","Thank you. Panya's last standup, for sure."
"00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,521","Inversin: Yeah, for sure."
"00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,724","I'm out this week, guys, so it's been a pleasure."
"00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,326","But, uh, uh, yeah."
"00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,630","Crook: Go inside, Victor. You're next."
"00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,999","Schafer: Yeah, nice try, Victor. Crook: There you go."
"00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,268","Romero: Almost. -Schafer: All right, we'll miss you, Panya. Victor!"
"00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,336",Crook: Yep. Schafer: Victor.
"00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,871","Romero: I'll miss you, Panya, uh..."
"00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,807","Schafer: Oh, shipping games is always tense, and then afterwards there's this moment"
"00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,643","where if there's ever gonna be any turnaround in the company,"
"00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:34,013","it usually happens at that moment, 'cause people hang on to the--they want--"
"00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,582",everyone wants to finish the project they're on.
"00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,817","That--so that's usually the period where people will come and go,"
"00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,352",is--is in that period.
"00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:43,523","Okay, everyone, thanks for coming to dailies all those times."
"00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,591",It's over. Next project.
"00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,493",Rice: Yay! Crook: That's it.
"00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:47,627","Stoddard: Man, he's sentimental."
"00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,862",Crook: Yeah.
"00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,134",Coull: So.
"00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,669",Sad panda- I'm leaving.
"00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,737",Um...
"00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,508",What else do you want to know about it.
"00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,713","No, I mean, um, the contract was supposed to come to an end anyway."
"00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:12,719",The fact that it went on a month after was pretty-- pretty awesome for me.
"00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:18,091","You know, maybe they'll need me again in the future, but, you know, you can't be certain, I guess."
"00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,561",Schafer: Oliver is still cranking away on the final final versions of it
"00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,229",to get it out the door.
"00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,765","And then Oliver will be moving back to Germany, sadly."
"00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,034",I think some of you know this; we've talked about this.
"00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:32,705",Oliver is--the-- the--the pull of the fatherland is too strong.
"00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,707",He must go back.
"00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,176",Oliver wants to move.
"00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,245","He's gonna keep working for us, but he's gonna move to Germany."
"00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:43,716","But he's gonna be working on ""Day of the Tentacle."" So you don't have to be mean to Oliver."
"00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,653","That's the main point. Usually when someone's leaving, we make sure everyone knows in advance"
"00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,122",so that they can be mean to them.
"00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,224","Franzke: So in a few weeks, I'm actually going to move back."
"00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,626",So it will be interesting to see how...
"00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,329",how much German culture has changed since I moved away.
"00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,198",Maybe I'll feel like a complete foreigner for a while.
"00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,833",Who knows? I don't even know.
"00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:04,337","So, all future interviews will have to be through Skype."
"00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,705","Offscreen: Gonna miss you, Oliver. Franzke: Yeah..."
"00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:06,773",I'm gonna miss you guys too.
"00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,541",It's gonna be weird.
"00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,345","Schafer: I think it's-- it's been a tough time because we haven't, you know,"
"00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,715","it's been a while since we've given raises to people, and so there's other companies in the area"
"00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:20,720","that are making a lot of money right now, and so they're able to throw that kind of money around,"
"00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,723","and that'll probably cause us to-- Uh, that always happens."
"00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:28,495","We lose through--when, like, Oculus and Facebook took off, they started throwing money around."
"00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,096",We lost some people to that.
"00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,366","Um, but after ""Broken Age"" comes out, we'll be able to throw money around, right,"
"00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,504","'cause we'll be rich off of, uh, all those point-and-click adventure dollars."
"00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:40,206","Actually, we don't expect to make a lot of money off of ""Broken Age,"""
"00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,041",because everyone bought it the first time.
"00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:49,349","And, um, but the new platforms like, um, PS4 are going to be opening up some new customers."
"00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,618","Bailey: There's a lot banking on it, but--but not everything."
"00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,854","I mean, we diversified to do some of those LucasArts properties"
"00:10:54,854 --> 00:11:01,528","like ""Grim Fandango"" and, like, uh, ""Day of the Tentacle."" Uh, so ""Grim"" sales are really good."
"00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,496","Um, you know..."
"00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:09,836","[Applause] It's, like, $1.7 million gross,"
"00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,004",which is good.
"00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,107","So, across all platforms for the last week, um..."
"00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,675",Schafer: I'm feelin' kinda gross. Bailey: Yeah.
"00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,711","And, you know, it looks like those are-- are gonna bring in a lot of, uh,"
"00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,080","a lot of money for the studio, so..."
"00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,084",Schafer: And I hope there's a lot of people out there who were just waiting for the whole thing to be one game
"00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,754",and don't care about crowdfunding and they don't wanna know about
"00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,689",our little transparency efforts.
"00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:35,028","They just wanna play a game when it's done and, um, hopefully they will buy it."
"00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,231",Please join me in welcoming Mr. James Spafford.
"00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,099","-Yay! -Thank you, guys."
"00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,035",James Spafford.
"00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,038","Uh, would you please stand up so everyone can see you."
"00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,440","This is James, and rotate one time."
"00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,175","No, you don't have to rotate."
"00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,476","Uh, James..."
"00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,445","uh, welcome to Double Fine."
"00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:57,250","So James Spafford used to be one of the two people who ran Mixnmojo, which is an old LucasArts fan site,"
"00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:03,756","and I knew him back then when he visited our offices in 2001, I think, and gave me some Marmite."
"00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:08,761","And, um...and now I said, ""In 10 years, we'll hire you."""
"00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:12,599","Fifteen years? ""In 15 years, we'll hire you""-- as our community manager."
"00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,001",-Whoa. -He's not the new Chris Remo.
"00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,003",He will never be the new Chris Remo!
"00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,671",-Yeah. Muir: 'Cause he's not dead.
"00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,508","Schafer: In other news, Chris Remo's dead."
"00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,077",No.
"00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:28,648","Spafford: I mean, I'm a long-time follower of Double Fine and everything they've been doing."
"00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:29,782",I'm a backer.
"00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,352","Uh, obviously backed immediately."
"00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:37,290","Um, followed the documentary series, which I'm now on, which is really weird, uh..."
"00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,192",Offscreen: Is he aware of everything that's happened?
"00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,526",Did he know what he was getting himself into?
"00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,829",Schafer: Don't tell him about gamergate.
"00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,631","No, he knows, he knows."
"00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:51,104","That's--that's the exciting new challenge for him, will be, um, rebuilding all the things."
"00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,505",Spafford: I knew what was going on.
"00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:58,044","I mean, certainly, lots of people were not happy about the game being split."
"00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:03,549","Um...so I feel like, yeah, that--that might've been the start of some troubles."
"00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:07,820",But probably the start of any community troubles was the day that the Kickstarter was made
"00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:14,193","and, um, $3.5 million was raised and a lot of people's money"
"00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:19,599","was riding on a thing that they had in their head, a vision that they had that this thing was gonna be."
"00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:26,205","And, you know, it wasn't the way some people wanted it to be."
"00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:30,009","I never want to give up on people who are like, ""You know, I'll try everything."""
"00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,346","If people are really mad, a lot of the time you can--"
"00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,682","you can--you know, you can bring them around."
"00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:39,352",There's always some way that you can make them happy again.
"00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:44,557","Um...yeah, it's just finding out what that is."
"00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:49,395","Schafer: It's--it's good timing, 'cause we're--as we're wrapping up the game, we're coming out of production"
"00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:53,399","and getting back into all the community-facing stuff, like getting out the last of the backer rewards."
"00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,369","Like, we still have a lot of these little mini portraits that Bagel has to paint."
"00:13:56,369 --> 00:14:00,406","So, like, it's come to that point where we're kind of, um,"
"00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:04,777","closin' the loop on the story, big story, and so we'll be facin' the backers a lot,"
"00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,613",and it's good to have a community manager for that.
"00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:18,291","Okay, so we're just--are we just talking about the launch plans for the game as far as PR and marketing?"
"00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,226",What's--what's your marketing budget on the game?
"00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,294",Rice: Zero...?
"00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,762",Schafer: Okay.
"00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:26,199","Spafford: One of the big things I wanna talk about is how we talk about ""Act 2"""
"00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:31,204","and how we properly do this, like how we bring this thing out."
"00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,206","Schafer: How do we talk about ""Act 2""? Spafford: The biggest thing, right."
"00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,741","Schafer: So just, like, the--what's it called?"
"00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,343","Spafford: Well, like, no, as in..."
"00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,645",how are you getting people to think about it?
"00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:44,517","You want people to think about it as a whole game, -or as episode two? Rice: Yeah."
"00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,787","Schafer: Like, now that it's done, I would like it to just be just ""Broken Age,"""
"00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,622",as if we never split it at all.
"00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:54,627","Rice: So, yeah, I think that the hope was, like, a year from now, the story would be more about just the game as it is,"
"00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,763",not that it was split or anything.
"00:14:56,763 --> 00:15:00,633","Spafford: When it was released, we did-- people did reviews of it and stuff, right?"
"00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,470","Like, treated it like it was its own thing."
"00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:10,243",So I wonder how persuadable people will be to just forget that and move on.
"00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,379","Rice: But I still think we probably have to speak to the people who did already buy it, and--"
"00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,682","Schafer: Yeah, because this is a worry that I do have, that people are like, ""When's 'Act 2' coming out?"""
"00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,519","And that they don't see that announcement, -""'Act 2' is out""-- Rice: Yeah."
"00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,189","Schafer: Like, the answer to that question, they might miss the fact that it came out."
"00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,791",Rice: Yeah.
"00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:29,829","Yeah, so I think we still need to be saying that, like, for people who purchased ""Act 1,"""
"00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:33,833","they're getting the full game now, updated with ""Act 2"" content."
"00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,202",Spafford: Yep. Rice: But...
"00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:41,374",Spafford: The PS4 and iOS is definitely a really good chance to just talk about the whole game.
"00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,676","So we've been trying to get people to play the PS4 version,"
"00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:48,381","which is a new platform, um, and doesn't have that distinction."
"00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,383","Like, it's just one game on that platform."
"00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,718","So the more people we can get to look at that and talk about that,"
"00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,822",the more-- the more hopeful we are that that can be a thing.
"00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:59,258","Rice: Not--not speaking to just, like, what's gonna happen in ""Act 2,"" you know,"
"00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:03,462","'cause that's how we've all been thinking about it for a long time, but speaking of, like,"
"00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,564",what is this game?
"00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:07,533",Spafford: Looking at the full-- the full picture now it's done.
"00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:12,572","Other than that, we're just trying to, you know, beg, borrow, and steal every bit of coverage we can."
"00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,641",Rice: We were able to get a European press tour on zero dollars.
"00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,677",Schafer: I...w-well... Rice: So that's good.
"00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:18,778",Schafer: We're not paying anything for that?
"00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:23,382","Rice: Um, we are paying for three days of a B&B, but they're paying for all of our flights"
"00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,285","and our B&B while we're there, so..."
"00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,554","Um, I think it's all pretty set now."
"00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:32,625","So, um, flights and hotels and everything is in there."
"00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:37,597","There'll be-- basically we get to UK first for the first weekend,"
"00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:41,734","and then the Monday after that we're doing, like, a bunch of press at Media Molecule."
"00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:49,108","Um, and we'll have Eurogamer, Edge, and The Guardian, uh, all that day in their offices."
"00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:54,614","And then, yeah, we have the talk in Vyborg with Peter and Ray."
"00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:18,503","[Music] Spafford: We should pick a day for having press around as well,"
"00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,538",and then we can start organizing them.
"00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:29,649","[Music] Schafer: So what do you think so far, Marty?"
"00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,750",Sliva: I think it's awesome.
"00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,320","Schafer: Give us your, um, full review now."
"00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,088","Sliva: Just verbatim, and then you guys can write it down."
"00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:41,193","Schafer: We need to know the score before we decide whether -you're leaving the room. Sliva: Yeah, okay."
"00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,697","Schafer: That's just a common-- Sliva: That's--that's happened-- That's happened before with other publishers, so--"
"00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,499","Schafer: Really? They're, like... Rice: Oh, God."
"00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:50,503","Sliva: I think it's mostly like, like, ""You can do an exclusive, but what's the score,"""
"00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,239","you know what I mean? It's like, well, I'm not gonna do that, then."
"00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,509","Uh, everyone always says, like, ""Oh, this is gonna be the adventure game"
"00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:59,178","that gets people to play adventure games who haven't played adventure games."""
"00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,579","Like, you--is that bullshit to you?"
"00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,315","Like, is that-- is that necessary?"
"00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:05,217","Do you think adventure games need that, -or do you think it's-- Schafer: I've always been--"
"00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,653","I've always been interested in it, because it always seemed like"
"00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:13,092",with adventure games that we were trying to get beyond the-- the limited audience
"00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,527",of people currently playing--playing games.
"00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:18,597","Not that they're limited, but there-- there was a, back in the '90s,"
"00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:22,601",a small group of the culture at large that was playing games at all.
"00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,405","And it seemed like there are all these people who weren't playing games and they're like, hey,"
"00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:30,509","I think you would like a game that, well, it's about story, where you don't have to worry about getting shot in the head,"
"00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:34,647","and, like, you could play at your own pace and it involved themes that weren't"
"00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,015","being covered in games, you know."
"00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:38,985","So we always, you know, we always, you know..."
"00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,687","People would tell us, like, ""This is the only game that my girlfriend will play with me."""
"00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,656",And it was--that was always the story.
"00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:47,226","Like, there's all these people out there who, you know, why aren't they playing games?"
"00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,061",And I think this is the game they would like.
"00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:54,734","But, um, you know, it's always been hard to reach those people, and, um, and make them feel like they would like--"
"00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,870","You know, they think of themselves as someone who would not play video games."
"00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,873","It's hard to get past that identity problem, almost."
"00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,643","Sliva: Totally. Schafer: So I do think about it, but I don't think it's necessary."
"00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,812","Like, I think it's good enough to make a game that people--"
"00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,347",and that's what this Kickstarter is all about.
"00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:12,151","Like, there are these people who said, ""We like adventure games just the way they are."""
"00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,654",And they don't need to completely revolutionize with--with how they interact.
"00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,989",They don't need to be a different genre.
"00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,292","They just, ""We like the old adventure games and we wanna play another one."""
"00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,729","And knowing they were out there and we were making the game for them, uh,"
"00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,731",is what made it special this time around.
"00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:31,504","Rice: There's always been, like, conversation coming up here and there about how we're gonna give backers the codes,"
"00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,340",or if we're gonna give them early access to the game or anything like that.
"00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,376","And I feel like it's never been, like, fully talked about and decided upon."
"00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:41,714","Schafer: I was--I wanted to give it just the--the day before, -the 24 hours before. Rice: Yeah."
"00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:46,619","Spafford: Yeah, if it's possible without too much mess, then I think that people will really appreciate it."
"00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,222","And in fact, we've set the embargo for press for the same time"
"00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,492","as the backers getting their keys so that, you know, everyone's getting"
"00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,494",their thing at the same time.
"00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,864","Offscreen: Yeah, 'cause the embargo thing was such an issue last time."
"00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,734",Spafford: I think there is all kinds of emotions about that.
"00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,636","Rice: Tim, did you hear that? Schafer: What?"
"00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:09,742","Rice: ""Digital Trends"" posted an article, ""Why We're Breaking the 'Broken Age' Embargo."""
"00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:13,145","Schafer: Tell 'em maybe he didn't agree to anything, but he knows he's bein' a shit."
"00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:18,517","Bailey: I was looking over all of our news broadcasts, and basically all the exposure went out"
"00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,753","when the backers got it, like, two weeks ago."
"00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:26,725",Spafford: I think that whole situation probably should have been done a bit differently.
"00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,496","I think we learned a lot from that, by the sounds of things, or at least I hope so."
"00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:35,434","And I've certainly watched that episode and--and thought, ""Okay, we need to not do that."""
"00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,606","Yeah, so, it--today is Friday."
"00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:48,180","Uh, on Sunday night, we're gonna send out backer keys to people, which is pretty exciting."
"00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:54,620","Um, 24 hours later, the game will unlock on Steam and be pushed out, uh, around the world"
"00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,290",onto however many millions of platforms that we're doing.
"00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:03,362","Um, so by Tuesday, uh, morning when we all come into the office,"
"00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:08,467","the game will be out, everyone will be playing, no one will have any problems, everything will be fine,"
"00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,202",and everyone will be having a good time.
"00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,571",That's--that's the gist of it.
"00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,673","Hansen: Flawless. Franzke: What could go wrong, right?"
"00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,642","Hansen: Yeah, don't say that."
"00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:17,676",Rice: It's all gonna be perfect.
"00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,112",Hansen: It--it may not be perfect.
"00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,381","Rice: Um, all right."
"00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,283",All right.
"00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,484",Let's put out the Kickstarter update?
"00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,719",Spafford: Let's do it.
"00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,622","Schafer: Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo."
"00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,825","Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo."
"00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,665","Hi, everybody."
"00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:40,866","Hello, hello, thank you for waiting."
"00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,536",Thanks for-- sorry about the delay.
"00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:46,038","It's still so interesting, Melina just magically appears there."
"00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,640","Hello, Melina, nice to see you."
"00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,474","Awesome, awesome."
"00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,576","Okay. Hi, everybody."
"00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:55,347","Uh, today I've been very preoccupied 'cause ""Broken Age"" is in the hands of our backers"
"00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,883","and people are playing it, which is amazing!"
"00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,318",Yeah!
"00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,987",Offscreen: Do you wanna look at the forum right now?
"00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,389",Schafer: Okay.
"00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:05,124","Let's go to the forum, shall we?"
"00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:08,494","""Spoiler: Need hint urgently."" Ah! Ah!"
"00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,528","Take that, right?"
"00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,629",Right?
"00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,731",Where's the general...
"00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:16,468","""Let's talk about how much we love the game"" thread?"
"00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,636",Let's see.
"00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,605",Discussion and feedback.
"00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:20,706","""I finished this morning."
"00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:23,008","What an incredible game!"" That's all I'm gonna read."
"00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,743",That's it.
"00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,580","""Everything about 'Act 2' has improved the game dramatically."
"00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,181",The puzzles are a lot more detailed.
"00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,384","Required me to pull out a notepad."" Yay."
"00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,554",That's nice. I'm glad it makes-- I get excited when I pull out a notepad.
"00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,756","""I liked 'Act 1,' but it was a little linear."
"00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,458",'Act 2' is perfect.
"00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:43,028","And to Tim and everyone at Double Fine, I really appreciate you and what you've done so much."""
"00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,263","Well, that's nice."
"00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:45,464",Ah! The game's out.
"00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,601","I mean, it really comes out tomorrow, or midnight tonight."
"00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:52,571","But it's out, the review embargo is lifted, we got a 9.2 from ""Game Informer,"""
"00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:56,642","and it should be good for launch, official launch day tomorrow,"
"00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:59,612",where it'll be out on all platforms and everywhere.
"00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:04,316","Um, so now we just sit around and read reviews and pretend we don't care about 'em."
"00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:07,286",That's the...regular thing.
"00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:09,989","I'm gonna sit there, like, all night just waiting for them to come in."
"00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,691","You see one, you're like, ""Oh, that-- that was awesome! I'm gonna read one more!"
"00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,994","Oh, that was bad, I'm not gonna-- not gonna read any m--"
"00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:18,631","Oh, that one was nice!"" And then it all evens out."
"00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:22,301","I just was reading, like, two different reviews, one talking about being too hard"
"00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,470","and one being, it's too easy."
"00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,607","And, uh, you know, that just seems to be the way with those games."
"00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,076","They're just, like, um..."
"00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:37,316","people--people react strongly and very subjectively and, um...I don't know."
"00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:40,653","Like, I feel like it takes years, almost, for people to really decide"
"00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:43,455",how they feel about these games.
"00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,791",So 10 years from now we'll find out if it was any good.
"00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,662","Offscreen: It seems a bit strange that there's review scores for ""Act 1,"" ""Act 2--"""
"00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,063",And the whole thing.
"00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,465","Schafer: Yeah, it's a mess... it's a mess."
"00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,833",Never split your game in half.
"00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,636","Rice: By the way, there's a lot of people talking about it, so that's good."
"00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:01,307","Um, and tomorrow we're partying, and I think I sent an invite out to everybody."
"00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:05,511","So, bar crawl, I think we're just starting at Victory Hall, 'cause it's close and we can walk there,"
"00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:08,547",and then we're gonna go-- Schafer: And then the hardcore. Rice: Chinatown.
"00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:14,553",Schafer: To people who care about history and wanna relive history through the bars of Chinatown and beyond.
"00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:19,658","Rice: So, tonight at 9:00 our time, midnight Eastern, is when all the other platforms will go up."
"00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,194","Bottle Opener: In the name of Lars Halford, open up!"
"00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,529","Franzke: Okay, so we've got Ouya lined up."
"00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,798",I guess we just need to press that button.
"00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,166",Rice: The button?
"00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:31,070","Uh, Spaff figured out some way to wire this weird Divekick button..."
"00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,572",Spafford: It's not that weird! Rice: ...to launching the game.
"00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,875","-Cheers. Franzke: Well, cheers to you guys."
"00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:41,413","Spafford: It's okay, we're toasting the five-- four-minute countdown"
"00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,015",to pressing the blue button.
"00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,717","Do you want the blue pill, or the yellow pill?"
"00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,552","Rice: Oh my God, everything explodes."
"00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:50,055","Franzke: The game gets deleted, obliterated from the server, so don't press the yellow button."
"00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,224",Spafford: All the money is refunded.
"00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,695","Franzke: The code gets unwritten, the art unmade."
"00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,131",Rice: Yep.
"00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:00,632","Spafford: What are we gonna do for four minutes, you guys?"
"00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,569",We could read Twitter for a bit.
"00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,738",Spafford: People are really happy. Rice: The reviews have been -really good. Spafford: Yep.
"00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:09,808","Rice: Just, like, the way they describe the puzzles and the writing,"
"00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,578","it makes it-- makes it feel like people actually really got it,"
"00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:16,815","-which is nice. Spafford: We should get ready, because we're about to--to go into..."
"00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,118","Rice: Let's do it, you guys."
"00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:22,454","Spafford: You should. Franzke: Okay, Greg, It's hovering over the button."
"00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,555",Rice: You do this one. Franzke: I do this one?
"00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,057",This is Steam; this is the big one.
"00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:27,626",Rice: I know. You do this one. Franzke: All right.
"00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:28,761","Spafford: Press the ""Okay"" button!"
"00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,029","Franzke: All right, here it goes!"
"00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,196",It's live on Steam.
"00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,598","Rice: Yay. Spafford: Oh, my God."
"00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,266","Rice: Okay. Spafford: All right, next one."
"00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,467","Franzke: Okay, here's iOS."
"00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,336","Spafford: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God."
"00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:39,204","Rice: Oh, man..."
"00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,506","Franzke: All right, here, Spaff."

"00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,043",Franzke: Release!
"00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,645",I'll do Ouya.
"00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,646","Rice: Yep, there you go."
"00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:48,747",You're in that one.
"00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,315",Spafford: Ouya's live?
"00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,483",Franzke: Waiting--yep. Spafford: Okay.
"00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,584",Franzke: Just Google Play.
"00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:53,786","Rice: Okay, wait, is this the last one?"
"00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:54,987",Franzke: Yeah. Rice: Let's all do this one.
"00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,221",Franzke: Okay. Ready?
"00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,190","Rice: Final build, one, two, three, go."
"00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:17,109","[Music] Franzke: But, yes, this is my last, I guess,"
"00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,178","full day in the office, one could say."
"00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:22,347","Not that I'm actually gonna do any work, but, um..."
"00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:25,384","Today is ""Broken Age"" launch day, officially."
"00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,219","Uh, so lots of parties lined up."
"00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:30,322","I am just gonna pretend they're all for me, for my leave--for one of my leaving parties."
"00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,624","Uh...but yeah, it's--it's weird."
"00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,626",It's weird. What is that? Oh.
"00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,495","Oh, because we don't actually need this anymore?"
"00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:41,700","That's true, I guess I don't need to talk while-- Brr!"
"00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,101",There's that.
"00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,575",All right?
"00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:53,579","Rice: We just put out the new trailer, so we're trying to, like, spread those around, um..."
"00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:55,013",Offscreen: Elijah Wood? Rice: I did see that.
"00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:58,484","So Elijah just tweeted, like, thirty minutes ago about the game."
"00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:00,285","Right there, see? Boom."
"00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,587","Yay, Elijah."
"00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:05,791","Like you see right now, we're at, like, twenty-five or so on the list."
"00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:11,196","Um...and then the hope is that that'll start going up, so, by a couple things."
"00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,266","One is, we can check and see now if it's getting featured."
"00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,300","Okay, so there it is."
"00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,835",Yay. So this showed up.
"00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,303","So this'll help, especially since it's on sale."
"00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,538","Um, that's always nice."
"00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,473",On Steam people see that sale number.
"00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:26,578",We do get daily Android and iOS sales.
"00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:32,451","PS4 probably won't, uh, give us any kinda inclination for, like, a week or so, maybe, um, maybe more."
"00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:34,486","Spafford: They're the most interesting ones, I think."
"00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,088","Rice: Yeah, that'll be interesting, 'cause it's new."
"00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:41,026",Um...brand-new sales and it's reviewing well there and everything.
"00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:45,831","So, uh, I think we'll have a better idea in, like, a couple weeks across all platforms,"
"00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:53,038","but we'll at least have an inkling of what to expect, um, from the ones that we can see soon."
"00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,376","It's just, those are the ones that we've already been out and being sold on for a while now,"
"00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,144",so it's hard to say.
"00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,312",That's it.
"00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:01,647",Congrats.
"00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:03,615",Schafer: Uh...
"00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,217","Yeah, yeah."
"00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,020",Rice: You're so excited.
"00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,388",Schafer: Yep.
"00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,622",Phone voice: Press one.
"00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,991","To send a voicemail, press two."
"00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,660",Schafer: I don't know what hap-- why it did that there.
"00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,094",Phone voice: Home screen.
"00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:21,300","Schafer: Oh, man. Rice: Okay, all you'll do is say ""Green,"" and then ""Okay."" Kipnis: Green and then--"
"00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,001","Schafer: You press ""Send"" to accept the call."
"00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,203","Rice: Yeah, this is an old phone, old-school phone."
"00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,538","Kipnis: This is a really old phone, yeah."
"00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,640",It's--it's a burner we got?
"00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,542",Greg: Yeah. Kipnis: Is this what drug dealers use?
"00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,010","Rice: Yes, it's a drug dealer-- Schafer: Oh, I got a voicemail."
"00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,478","Okay, okay."

"00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,482","Kipnis: I love that it announces. Rice: All right, can we start?"
"00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:41,820","Schafer: A hint line--we're talking about doing a hint line, getting a burner phone and just making it a number"
"00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,089",that people can call for hints.
"00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:48,493","You're supposed to say, ""Action."" Maybe talking to me..."
"00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,362",Hm.
"00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:54,766","I'll probably just be getting people angry, people calling to chew me out about ""Spacebase."""
"00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:58,070",Here's a hint: Go buy someone else's games.
"00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:02,374","Hi, and welcome to the Double Fine Hint Line, which we have had for a long time,"
"00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,142","but no one's ever called, it's weird."
"00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:07,713","Uh, but we're answering calls today for ""Broken Age,"" 'cause today is the launch of ""Broken Age""!"
"00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,247","Phone voice: Call one. Schafer: Oh, we got a call!"
"00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,649","Hold on, everybody."
"00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:13,652","Hello, Double Fine Hint Line, can I help you?"
"00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:14,987","Phone: Uh, hello, is this Tim?"
"00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:16,088",Schafer: This is Tim.
"00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,255",How are you doing?
"00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,523","Phone: Oh m--oh, my God."
"00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:25,163","Hello, my name is, uh, Steve Kaufman, and I just wanna say, you are the greatest developers"
"00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,199","in--in history, basically."
"00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,533","Schafer: Oh, that's so nice of you to say!"
"00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,502","-Oh, that's lovely! Kipnis: Wow."
"00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:34,206","Phone: Uh, I was really happy as a backer to see it all come together."
"00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,508","Schafer: Aw, thanks for backing. Phone: So, I love it."
"00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:40,379","Yeah, um, and I actually have a legit-- like, I need a legit tip."
"00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,547","Schafer: Okay, all right, that's why we're here."
"00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:43,649","Kipnis: Wow, this is really working well."
"00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:46,585","Rice: There's a lot of people-- Schafer: Hello, Double Fine Hint Line, can I help you?"
"00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:52,524","Kipnis: Maybe some--some asshole would call in and just say really mean things to us, live on the stream."
"00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:54,259","But it was, like, the opposite."
"00:29:54,259 --> 00:30:00,499","It just, like, it completely blew our expectations, in the similar way that seeing the game get funded did"
"00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,833",on that first day.
"00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,703",It made you feel like the world is a much better place than you thought it was.
"00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:06,138",Schafer: Bye. Phone: Goodbye.
"00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,373",Schafer: What a lovely fellow. Lovely fellow.
"00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,508",-That was spoiler-free. -Yeah. There we go.
"00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:12,244","Spoilers: Uh, our backers are great."
"00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:15,313","Phone: This is Emory Biloski from, uh, Israel calling, actually."
"00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,049",Schafer: You're calling from Israel?
"00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,550",What time-- what time is it there?
"00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,851",-Isn't it super late there? Kipnis: Shalom.
"00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,554","Phone: It's, uh, it's like 1:30 in the morning."
"00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:23,989",Schafer: Shalom.
"00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,724","Hello, Double Fine Hint Line, can I help you?"
"00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:26,825","Double Fine Hint Line, can I help you?"
"00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,527","Rice: Blowin' up, blowin' up."
"00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:30,729","Schafer: Hello, Double Fine Hint Line, can I help you?"
"00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:31,830","Phone: Oh, shit."
"00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,465","Uh, hi."
"00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,500",Schafer: Language!
"00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,136","Kipnis: Yeah, it was just-- it was a really pleasant surprise,"
"00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:42,407","like, just how lovely everyone was and, like, how fun that whole day--"
"00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,544",that whole day was really amazing.
"00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,145",Spafford: That's it. We're done.
"00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:50,215",Kipnis: Yay. That was-- that was a great last call.
"00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,584","Rice: Well, we might turn the phone back on later."
"00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,419","Kipnis: Really? Rice: So, you never know."
"00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,456","Schafer: While we're hangin' out, just out in the bar later?"
"00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,691","All right, let's get this good time over with."
"00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,159",Woo!
"00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,862",Nothing seems to happen until I stand up and get everyone's attention
"00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,030",and then say thank you to everybody.
"00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,264",I've made so many toasts.
"00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,467","Peter McConnell's here, everybody."
"00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:09,768",Peter McConnell. Nice to see you.
"00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:11,169",Thank you for all the excellent music in the game.
"00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:12,637","McConnell: Well, thank you."
"00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,640","When you've worked on something for--for a good long time,"
"00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,644","you know, over two years, you know, two and a half for me, three I think for the--"
"00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:27,419","for--for the--the team at large, um, uh, it's hard not to be, you know,"
"00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,221",a little misty-eyed about it.
"00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:34,726","It's-it's like getting to the end of the game, when you play the game, um,"
"00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:38,797","where--where you have to, um, say, oh, well, you know, these characters"
"00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:43,435","have become my friends and--and now I have to say, you know, goodbye to the story"
"00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,170",and goodbye to the characters.
"00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,773","And so there's a certain amount of sadness, I guess."
"00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:52,310","And--and, uh, certainly, um, you know, there's a little relief."
"00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,448","It's always nice to be-- actually to say, oh, finally, you know?"
"00:31:56,448 --> 00:32:02,187","Um, you know, but there's also that, oh, well, you know..."
"00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,256","I mean, that's..."
"00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,792","that's like, uh...um..."
"00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:09,561","It's, uh, an--an era, you know?"
"00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:14,666","A really big project like that, you love like--like a-- like a child."
"00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:19,504","And, uh, letting it go out into the world is a--is a-- is an emotional moment."
"00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:20,705",Schafer: Call me if you need any hints.
"00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,274","If you need any hints, give me a call."
"00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,508",All right.
"00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,477","Now, then..."
"00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:31,583",[Gasps] Agh!
"00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,556",[Laughter] That's what you get for being cute!
"00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:40,659","TV: Oliver, safe travels and best of luck for the future."
"00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:46,431","And everybody else, stay awesome, stay strong, and find joy in the things that you do."
"00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,465",-Bye. Schafer: Bye!
"00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,567",Kipnis: Aw...
"00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,135",Wow.
"00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,269",Schafer: Awww.
"00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,504","TV: ""Broken Age"" got released..."
"00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:53,805",Kipnis: Oh!
"00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,507",Schafer: Majus!
"00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,876",TV: I'm so happy for all of you.
"00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,811",Congratulations.
"00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,715","You finished this work of art, and now everybody can see and play it"
"00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,184",and it's wonderful!
"00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:13,592",[Laughter] Struggled with problems and obstacles.
"00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:18,597",Ups and downs are a normal part
"00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,566",of the whole project.
"00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:24,102",And you should embrace that.
"00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,470",It's part of it.
"00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:30,442","""Broken Age"" is made out of the ups and downs."
"00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:35,413",I am really emotional right now.
"00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,616",I wish I could talk to you for real right now.
"00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:41,887",And hope I see you again soon in the future.
"00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:44,256","And, uh, let's make more games."
"00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:48,560",Let's show the world how the sausage gets made.
"00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,862","And, um, yeah."
"00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,464",I love you guys.
"00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:53,732",Crowd: Aw!
"00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:56,101",TV: And...yeah.
"00:33:56,101 --> 00:34:00,338","Let's, uh, let's--we--we'll-- we'll talk in person, so let's not do this."
"00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:03,642",[Laughter] Schafer: Let's not let this get weird.
"00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,076",TV: Bye. Bye.
"00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,044",I love you.
"00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,479","Crowd: Bye, Majus!"
"00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,813","Schafer: I mean, crowdfunding was so great, and is so great in a lot of ways."
"00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:14,185","Like, it's--the--the, um, the relationship you have with the community"
"00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:18,489","and the-- and the nature of the money is so, um, perfect for what you wanna do,"
"00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:25,096",do something creative and--and community focused without worrying about ties to people
"00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:28,166",who might wanna try to influence your game because they gave you money.
"00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:33,170",Um...it's--it's weird because it just happened to time out--
"00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:39,244","it happened to coincide with a weird phase of the Internet where everyone's super angry all the time and it just, like--"
"00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,781",it was hard to be that open and transparent and give everybody--
"00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:47,319","It's like we opened up a little tray of, you know, bludgeoning instruments so that--"
"00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:49,254",for people could beat us up with.
"00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,523",And then people picked 'em up and just beat us up with them.
"00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:53,224","And we're like, huh, that was an interesting experiment."
"00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:56,761",We probably shouldn't have given all those weapons to all the people who are mad.
"00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:01,833","But, um, if that had not erupted at that moment, you know, maybe I would've thought--"
"00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:05,403","'Cause at the beginning, the transparency was nothing but, like,"
"00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,673","um, hugs and, uh, high-fives all around."
"00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:12,544","Like, everybody at our-- you know, our PAX meetups, like, that was our community experience,"
"00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:15,413",was everyone just telling us how much they were excited about the game
"00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,082",and how much they loved us and everything.
"00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:23,088","And then when we announced the change in the schedule, just all that-- just people just--"
"00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:26,591",it seemed like there was a big crowd of people just ready to-- just really super mad.
"00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:32,430","And if you Google, like, um, ""'Broken Age,' broken promises"" on the Internet-- which I do every night--"
"00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,499","if you Google that, you'll see all these angry articles."
"00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:38,536","Not just from, like, random people on Twitter, but, like, these journalists who are like,"
"00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:42,207","""They really let everybody down with this and they should really be sorry."""
"00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:43,708","And, um..."
"00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:47,379","and here we are at the end and we're shipping the game and it took a long time,"
"00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,547",but it's everything we said we were gonna do.
"00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:53,518","Uh...and I want to mail all those people individually and be like,"
"00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,988","""It's time for you to apologize about that article."" But I don't think they feel like they were wrong."
"00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,557",I think they feel like-- that we still really messed up.
"00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,226","But, um, I don't."
"00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,194",I feel like...
"00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,296",I feel--isn't it great to know I've learned nothing?
"00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,132",But I feel like...
"00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:12,670","[Laughter] I feel, like, officially that--"
"00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,141","I feel like I just need to make an official announcement that I don't apologize for anything,"
"00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:18,043",because I feel really good about it.
"00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:21,146","And if we had shipped one day earlier, the game would've been one day buggier."
"00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:26,317","And, um, if we had shipped the game that the original $3.3 million paid for,"
"00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:27,619",it would've been small.
"00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:31,122","And I like the game that we made instead, and we put a lot of our own money into it,"
"00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,291","and I think I'm really, really happy."
"00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:37,595","This is the game, this is what the game kinda said that it wanted to be, about this size,"
"00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,030",and we did a really good version of it.
"00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,666",And so I don't apologize for anything.
"00:36:41,920 --> 00:37:38,857",[Music] Raz: He makes me laugh.
"00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:42,360","""And that's why it's called a game."" Schafer: Yay!"
"00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:49,134",[Applause] That's awesome.
"00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:52,504","Uh, even though you like basketball..."
"00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:55,340",Burbank: We all have our faults.
"00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,474","Schafer: That's awesome. Well, yes."
"00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,642","Well, that's awesome."
"00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,677","Now, uh, congratulations, Gabe."
"00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,246",No speech?
"00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:02,747",Gabe: No. Schafer: Okay.
"00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:05,617",Oh...one more thing.
"00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:09,087","We have boxes of ""Broken Age,"" actual boxes of ""Broken Age,"""
"00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:11,990",and we have enough for everyone here to get one!
"00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,091",Ryken: It's under our seat?
"00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,292",Schafer: What?
"00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,827",Look under your seat...
"00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:19,130",and that'll give me time to open this box.
"00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:25,303","Offscreen: Now that this is wrapping up, like, how do you feel about the whole experience?"
"00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:30,742",Schafer: I wish I really knew right now if I could say 100% what I learned from all that.
"00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:35,680","'Cause some of it's still, you know, uh, too soon."
"00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,117","Like, uh, 'cause there's this part of me that's like, I just wanna not tell anybody"
"00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:40,385",about what we're working on right now.
"00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:43,254","Like, I feel just kinda, like, so exposed that I just wanna be--"
"00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:47,759","I just wanna have some secrets for a little while, just as a kinda break from that."
"00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:51,629","I had a pleasant trip down memory lane making an adventure game, but I remembered"
"00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:52,764",how hard they are to make.
"00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:56,568","And, um, I don't think my next game will be an adventure game."
"00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,736",I wouldn't say I'd never make one again.
"00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:02,640","But in the end, I really-- I really think the team put together a beautiful game,"
"00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,076",and that's what I'm most happy with.
"00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,344",'Kay.
"00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,480","Now, this is gonna be awkward in case this came out wrong."
"00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,586",This is a little light.
"00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:15,687",That's a different game.
"00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,322",What?
"00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:21,693","Whoa, -look at that. -Beautiful."
"00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:22,794","It looks beautiful, okay wait."
"00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:24,162",I don't believe it.
"00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:26,631","The design of this was supposed to have Vella on the bottom,"
"00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,600",'cause her hair is touching the logo.
"00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,003","Not that I'm gonna complain, 'cause it's really awesome."
"00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:33,671",Okay.
"00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,306",I--I just have to demonstrate before you leave.
"00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,441",This is fantastic.
"00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:40,345",Let's see if it works; I've never tested this before.
"00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,780","Gah, no, it doesn't work."
"00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,148",Gah! Nope.
"00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,651","Let's see, how does it actually--?"
"00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:49,320","Okay, get rid of this."
"00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,522",Whoa...
"00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:52,624",Very cool.
"00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:53,491","And that, and that?"
"00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:54,592",See?
"00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,227","And then, oh..."
"00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:00,331","I want everyone to do that when you get your copy and fix it, okay?"
"00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,673","[Applause] That is kinda funny, we did Kickstart this thing"
"00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:11,242",and now it's actually a box in my hand.
"00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,844","Well, that pretty much ends this documentary."
"00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,646",And...scene.
"00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:17,548",I really hoped when it came out people wouldn't forget about
"00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,584",how it was funded and just kinda talk about the game.
"00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,320","But it seemed like every review had to talk about the development story,"
"00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,856","and so that was part of the lore for a long time, still."
"00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:29,494","So I hope, um, five years from now when people talk about adventure games,"
"00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,229",they can look at it as just an adventure game.
"00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:35,199","And so I think it'll be remembered well, and people can just kinda get over"
"00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,468",the crowdfunding part of it.
"00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:42,473","Kipnis: I--to be honest with you, I'm not really sure how this whole thing is gonna be looked at in the end."
"00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,842",Um...
"00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:49,314","I--I guess, like, everyone has hopes for, like, a game when it comes out,"
"00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:53,451","and I had certain hopes that, um..."
"00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,820","maybe were not fulfilled, necessarily."
"00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:02,827","And, uh, and it has more to do with just, like, I really hoped people would love the game."
"00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:07,598","Um, and it's not to say that they didn't, but I kinda just, um--"
"00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:14,605",I think there--there was a lot of controversy surrounding the game and the company
"00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,574",that I wish hadn't been there.
"00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:20,611","Like, I just wish it was..."
"00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:21,579",I don't know.
"00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:24,148","Annable: It was a long, hard road, and it was very public,"
"00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,218",and I feel like there were a lot of things that changed.
"00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:32,991","Um, and they weren't necessarily just because of ""Broken Age"" and its visibility."
"00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:37,795","I think the company is a different company now than it was three years ago,"
"00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:41,599","and I'm trying to still figure out, why?"
"00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,501","I don't know, are we just older?"
"00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,537","Offscreen: Do you have any expectation of ""Broken Age's"" performance?"
"00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:47,872",Annable: I don't know.
"00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:51,376","Bailey: And then...uh, talking about sales of ""Broken Age,"""
"00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:54,545","so, uh, sales on Steam, we had a feature spot."
"00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:58,383","Um, it acted more like an update than, like, a--a new push."
"00:41:58,383 --> 00:42:03,988","Um, however, we got a feature on Apple, which is doing really well; about $25,000 a day."
"00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:09,160","Um, and then we also have, um, sales for, uh, Sony."
"00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,563","PS4, we had, like, $100,000 worth of sales, uh, over the weekend."
"00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,766","And it just got featured, so, uh, that's cool."
"00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:17,769","Schafer: My expectation-- my expectation of ""Broken Age"" in the end"
"00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:19,570",would just be to break even.
"00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,707","I know it was kind of always like a Kickstarter, like, you plan on it--"
"00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:27,612","Like, it's--the risk is gone of losing money on it, so you know you've broken even if you just make the game"
"00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:28,813",to that amount of money.
"00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:32,583","But we made it, like, twice as much, almost, as we got in, or more."
"00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:36,454","And so, um, we will just about make that back."
"00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:40,358","And the biggest change is that we don't need the publishers anymore, 100%."
"00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:43,795","You know, it used to be, like, there was no money in the world outside of publishers."
"00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:45,596",And I think crowdfunding's here to stay.
"00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:48,499","I think it's, um, hopefully gonna grow."
"00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:52,770","And in my dream-- my dream world, it would be big enough to fund AAA games"
"00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:58,109",and it would be the way that we fund all games going forward.
"00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:01,379","So now when we're talking to a publisher, the deals are better."
"00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:04,849","We're asking for less money, but we're also not entirely dependent on them"
"00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:06,584",to make payroll next week.
"00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,519","We're not like, ""Please, we just--sign us."
"00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,523","We'll--we'll sign anything, we just gotta make payroll."" It's like, okay, you gotta kick us in the teeth"
"00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,358",once a month and all this stuff.
"00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:17,662",And now we only have to take good deals with people we like.
"00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:21,666","So we still work with publishers, but, um, it's different."
"00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:24,502",Because we're 100% in control.
"00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,872","Annable: Yeah, we're not..."
"00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:31,476",we're not rollin' in millions of dollars.
"00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:35,880","I--I don't know if that would necessarily make us happier, though."
"00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,483",Schafer: You guys are the best.
"00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:40,485",Thank you for all your lovely audio.
"00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:41,853",And thanks for your beard.
"00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:43,488",Stoddard: It's kind of a milestone.
"00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:50,127","I think there's a-- there's a few things in general around gaming that ""Broken Age,"" like,"
"00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:54,499",really kinda did a push towards a new area.
"00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:56,634",And I like that.
"00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,871","Um, there's a whole bunch of stuff, like, we could've done differently"
"00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,473","and, like, we definitely fell down in some areas."
"00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,308","But, like, so what?"
"00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,843","Like, that's how you-- that's how you go forward."
"00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:10,014","Like, if you never fail, then you just aren't learning anything."
"00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:13,284","You're just... being boring, really."
"00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,554",Franzke: I think it was a huge success.
"00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:19,290","Without this project, who knows?"
"00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:25,229","Maybe Kickstarter would have never been the prime platform for, you know, crowdfunded games."
"00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:31,002","I think it made it possible for a lot of other people to--to work on their dream projects,"
"00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:33,404","so that's--that's pretty cool, yeah."
"00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:36,474","So overall, you know, I couldn't be happier, I really couldn't."
"00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:42,446","And, you know, the other day, um, the other day I went to just a random technology store"
"00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:46,017","here in Germany, and--and we just, um..."
"00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,252",walked by this little thing.
"00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:54,258","So, just have--to see this physical manifestation of all the work that, you know,"
"00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:57,562","went into--into this game is, like, super awesome."
"00:44:57,562 --> 00:45:00,231","Schafer: Hey, Ray! Good job. Crook: Has the soundtrack in there."
"00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,199","Schafer: Oh, I forgot to mention, it has the soundtrack in there."
"00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,503","Crook: I mean, I guess we did accomplish what we wanted to, which was to do this game."
"00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:08,773","And we--and we did that, and we--and we finished it."
"00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:14,612",I think what we did do that was the-- that I think was the most beneficial to everybody
"00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:21,819",was that we kind of cracked things open and we let people look inside of how things work.
"00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:28,492","And this maybe will help them to see how things-- uh, how difficult, uh, it is,"
"00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:32,496",and how we're kinda lucky that anything even comes out.
"00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:36,467","Like, that any video games actually get finished, um, is kind of a miracle."
"00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:37,501",And--and so that's good.
"00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,804",I hope that-- that helps...
"00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:44,208","I--I hope that helps people who are fans of video games and like playing video games,"
"00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:49,080","it just helps them understand and have a little bit of empathy towards, uh,"
"00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,616",those of us who are in this industry.
"00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:57,855","Um...you know, we're lucky to be in it, and I--you know, I'm grateful to be in it, um,"
"00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:01,826","but it's not always easy, and--and it's-- and I'm glad that"
"00:46:01,826 --> 00:46:06,364","we were able to show that to people in--in an honest way, so it's kinda neat."
"00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:12,403","I mean, if Double Fine's not around in 10 years, let's just, say, um-- it'll always be rem--"
"00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:13,804","like, it's out there now forever, right?"
"00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:17,208","Once it's on the Internet, um, it'll always be there."
"00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:20,044",And so...so...
"00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:23,614",Double Fine will always be...
"00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,882",...around.
"00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:36,761",[Music] Stoddard: I think it was very positive.
"00:46:36,761 --> 00:46:39,163",I think there was a lot of stuff that we really did contribute
"00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:40,598",to the games industry.
"00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:45,369","And...uh, and there's a lot of stuff that we sidestepped and, like, misstepped."
"00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,405","And we're trying to learn from that, too."
"00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:53,344","So, um, considering all that, I--going back and playing the actual game,"
"00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:55,346",I actually think we did really solid work.
"00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:58,849","And I actually think it's, um..."
"00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:01,719",I think it's a really good game.
"00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:05,189",I haven't really seen many reactions that are just blasé.
"00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:08,859","Like, it--it's usually a strong reaction, one way or the other."
"00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:14,765","And to me, in any art form, that's great."
"00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:18,202","Like, that means that it's provoking something."
"00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:21,472",And I think that's what this is about.
"00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:26,143","If, like, we did three years of work and there was all these trials and tribulations"
"00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:30,815","and at the end somebody just went, ""Meh,"" like, that would be crushing!"
"00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,150",But it hasn't been like that; it's been the opposite.
"00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:38,556","Like, it's either really, really good or really, really awful or, you know,"
"00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:41,592","very, very vocal, no matter what."
"00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:43,761",Great.
"00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:45,796",Then we did our job.
"00:47:47,520 --> 00:49:42,200",[Music]
