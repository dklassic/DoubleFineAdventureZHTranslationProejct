"00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:24,840",[Music] Petty: So I can double-check that he put everything up.
"00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,660","The rest of them, I'm going to scan them all, yeah, so we can have them."
"00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,560","We have a, you know, our concept art directory."
"00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:41,640","You know, in theory if all the puzzles were done and the things were decided on, we could actually make a pretty functional game with really rough art early on"
"00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,966",to sort of unblock the puzzle design or implementation.
"00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:49,054","And some of the systems work, which would be nice."
"00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:49,838",I'm not sure.
"00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,580","I'm a big fan of working that way, but I'm not sure if we'll be able to do it for this project or not."
"00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,800",We'll have to see how that works out.
"00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:32,316",[Music] Rice: Yep.
"00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,317","If you're always showing this board, won't they get spoilers from the board?"
"00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,300","So just to bring us up to date, I need another location for the cloud nest."
"00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,360",Things that came up from the art jam.
"00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,580",Cloud nests.
"00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,160",Rice: You can tell that that's going to look awesome.
"00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,120","Schafer: The first thing Peter mentioned, too."
"00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,680","Rice: Yeah, I think he drew that the first day."
"00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,980",Schafer: And then the other one is the dead-eye pyramid.
"00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,440",Rice: Why is it dead-eye?
"00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,860",Schafer: Spoiler. Can't tell you.
"00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,760",Rice: I have to play the game to find out?
"00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,940",Schafer: These things all still work but maybe this becomes his story.
"00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,580",The monster lands move over here.
"00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,160",Maybe that moves over there.
"00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:34,840","Rice: What I still am not clear on is, and I don't know if you are, is switching back and forth between these stories"
"00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,460",and how we're going to handle that.
"00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,780",Schafer: Yeah.
"00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,840",I'm putting that off.
"00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,102",Rice: Yeah. Start thinking about it.
"00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:47,913","So I'm just wondering then, like if I'm here, here and here and I jump back to this, then what's the world like?"
"00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,220",Like why can't I do this and what happens that makes me so I can do this?
"00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,680",Schafer: I don't know. I don't know yet.
"00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,420",Schafer: I've been a little behind.
"00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:09,663","It's frustrating because I, when the team is waiting for you, that's always frustrating, so."
"00:03:09,663 --> 00:03:10,463",It's always been that way.
"00:03:10,463 --> 00:03:16,080","Like having an absolutely terrifying deadline is the only thing that, makes me get it done."
"00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:24,007","There's just so many other things going on with the company right now that, you know, The Cave is getting to this point where it needs, you know,"
"00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:26,047",it has a dialogue deadline of its own.
"00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:30,227","You know, and do I help with that or do I work on this game?"
"00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,480",Suck it!
"00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:48,943",[Monster Roar] Schafer: Peter McConnell's here today.
"00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:51,034",It's fun to see what he's going to add to it.
"00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,480",Schafer: So the game.
"00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,460","You see, we did some art already."
"00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:59,234","We had art jam with Peter Chan and Scott Campbell and Nathan came to town and hung out with Lee, and did some art."
"00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,140",And that's cool.
"00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,445",And that corkboard is kind of up-to-date.
"00:04:01,445 --> 00:04:07,111","I could add some as we talk, but we're doing a point and click graphic adventure."
"00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,560",I don't know if you heard that. McConnell: Very cool.
"00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,249",Schafer: So it doesn't have a high concept in terms of like a heavy metal fantasy world or the Day of the Dead.
"00:04:15,249 --> 00:04:19,386",It's really like a new world that we're making up based on Nathan Stapley's art.
"00:04:19,386 --> 00:04:26,500","You know, just having that cool look and having it be about themes that are different, maybe than other themes."
"00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,161",McConnell: Yeah. I've got questions.
"00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,736",Schafer: There'll be no questions during this meeting.
"00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,160",Schafer: Is Peter McConnell excited to be on the project?
"00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,397",You're asking me if he's excited?
"00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,321",I think so.
"00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,441",We always enjoyed working together.
"00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:44,521","You know, he's worked on everything I've done since Day of the Tentacle, Monkey II, Monkey II."
"00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:45,701",Offscreen Voice: He's like your Danny Elfman.
"00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:46,521",Schafer: He's what?
"00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:47,572",Offscreen Voice: He's like your Danny Elfman.
"00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,000",Schafer: He's like my Danny Elfman.
"00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,321",He can do Danny Elfman if you ask him to.
"00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,140","McConnell: I'm just thinking about instruments, you know."
"00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,278","I'm thinking about styles and I'm probably going to have to think quite a bit about it,"
"00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,900","because it's, I mean, I have some things that are popping into my head."
"00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,935",I don't know if they're probably way jumping the gun at this point.
"00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:16,340","But what comes to mind about, about a world where things are being made for you and it's like a playroom a little bit, is a music box."
"00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,040","And you know, a little bit like Mr. Roger's Neighborhood, whichâ€¦"
"00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,887",Schafer: It also has that repetitive quality to it.
"00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,790","Because the game is going to start in this like, his routine is the same every day, even though it's drastically different."
"00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,625","It's really like he wakes up, the robots dress him."
"00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:34,141","You know, the arms just come out of nowhere and make him dinner, food."
"00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:38,678","And then when he busts out and he's doing actual 90's, 80's creepy space adventure."
"00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,888",Or 2001 like.
"00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:42,488",McConnell: Yeah. Schafer: Yeah.
"00:05:42,488 --> 00:05:51,260","McConnell: Then 2001 would be, 2001 will be hard to do, you know, without a great big orchestra."
"00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,900",And I don't think we have that.
"00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,608","But I don't think, you know."
"00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,551",Schafer: And now it's like a little more like now we're running our own actual budget.
"00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,738","Schafer: It's like we have a certain amount of money in the budget for Peter, which means a certain amount of time."
"00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,975",And we have to like wait until we're ready for him to be really effective in working.
"00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,080","So we've got to be at a point where we can just tell him, here's a list of characters that need themes."
"00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,523","Here's a list of areas, 'cause he's got to spread out his time so he doesn't just score the first two acts and then run out of time."
"00:06:18,523 --> 00:06:22,245","So he's got to like spread it out, look at the whole game, think about the game play."
"00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,880",Then think about how much of that money he should save to pay for things like live musicians.
"00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,560",Studio time.
"00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,780","McConnell: Yeah, I think there is going to have to be a signature piece, for sure."
"00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:39,660","And that is, or you know, or two halves of the signature piece because you got these two worlds."
"00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,510","Min: Yeah, yeah, that, too."
"00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,360",Rice: It'll be interesting to see how we can handle that.
"00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:50,020","You know, like if there're themes that persist in both their worlds or you know, funny little things to do to connect their two."
"00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,340",Min: I think that Pete's going to be able to knock that out pretty easily.
"00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:59,380","I think it's more the initial, but then it's the same thing with Tim, you know, I mean you go crazy for two days"
"00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,860",and then on the third day you just kind of come up with something.
"00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,858","You know, that's how creative magic happens."
"00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,622","I mean, and I think it's almost like you have to be patient with yourself and not, not panic."
"00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,760","McConnell: You know, that backer money don't last forever."
"00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,680",Rice: That's the truth.
"00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:24,260","Music Lumberjack: That's not a word, is it?"
"00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,700",Tree: No. We're done here.
"00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,740",Kipnis: Yes! Schafer: Awesome. Done. Rice: Yeah.
"00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:39,270",For the last four months we've spent in preproduction mode and it's been kind of exploratory phase of trying to figure out what the game is
"00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:44,300","and both in terms of design, but also in how we're going to actually make that happen."
"00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:52,247","But yeah, everyone's kind of had their own separate little tasks and those are all starting to converge now to where"
"00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:55,867",we're ready to start actually building a puzzle in the engine.
"00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,180",Crook: Actual production work is awesome.
"00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,740","Like we're going to go, this could get shipped."
"00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,340",Like this work.
"00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,480",Schafer: We'll see how it turns out.
"00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,760","Crook: Yeah, we'll see."
"00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,220","Rice: Ray Crook, Double Fine animator."
"00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:15,242","Yeah, Ray started on the project and he's been someone who's been at the company since like essentially the beginning."
"00:08:15,242 --> 00:08:21,181","Crook: I was excited to work with Tim again, because Brutal Legend was the last game that,"
"00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:24,454","you know, we'd worked closely together on."
"00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,985",And so I was most excited just to work with him.
"00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:32,025","But you know, I knew there would be cameras."
"00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,320",Crook: So I'm actually excited to be starting on that.
"00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:42,299","Crook: You know, the beginning of preproduction is really exciting and then it seems like eventually it gets kind of like,"
"00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,979",you're just kind of churning.
"00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:49,050","You know, I guess just, let's just get this show on the road, you know, is sort of the way that it feels."
"00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,830",And that's where we are.
"00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,815",Schafer: Awesome. Bye.
"00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,956","Crook: Tim has picked a puzzle, which we're calling First Playable."
"00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,960","Petty: So these are some of the stuff Peter gave me on Friday, right?"
"00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,020","And so I think this is the stuff we talked about when he was here, which is the idea of them having this little sacrificial island, which is awesome."
"00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,334","Cakes, in a U. But I was still worried about like if you put this into game camera mode, game layout mode,"
"00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,940",that'd be kind of blocked up.
"00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,260",And I did this real rough thing.
"00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,940","I just got Peter's revision, right."
"00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,331","And so this was the idea like from a game camera you would be, you would kind of start here."
"00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,260",So we could start with a pan and we kind of move up and we kind ofâ€¦
"00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:35,217","Rice: But yeah, it's the scene where the main character, I mean main female character is being offered up for sacrifice to a monster."
"00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,320",Schafer: Could it show up just behind the princess?
"00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,330",You just see something like feet?
"00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,050",Like what the fuck is it!? Petty: Yeah.
"00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,201","Schafer: You can't see it all, then it comes between, like oh my God!"
"00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:44,234",And it's gone.
"00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,882","You just never see it up close until it gets, comes in here and like eats that one."
"00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,006","Rice: Yeah, it's going to be a lot of work, for sure, because it's just a lot of animation and cut scenes."
"00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:57,306",So it's going to be a tough one.
"00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:09,023","Stapley: So you're saying for the end of this sprint we're really going to try to get the, get the sacrifice feast all set up?"
"00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:16,740","'Cause that's the thing, like if every puzzle's going to have like say five or so new characters, that's like, kind of a lot of time."
"00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,490","Petty: Well, and that's exactly why we want to take this to finals, because it's just conjecture"
"00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,912",until we kind of get an area to really know exactly how long.
"00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,909",I made estimates based on our progress.
"00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:31,769","Petty: Like there's always this period that when you start any game where you're trying to, you're trying to build it,"
"00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:39,138","you're trying to build something both at like artistically you're like yeah, it's the right mood, that's the right game play, that's the right look."
"00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:46,082",But you're also trying to build something to get an idea of how long it takes you to build the rest of the game.
"00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:49,338","And part of that is you need, you need enough information about the rest of the game,"
"00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,534","like you know, there's always this theoretical ideal that you never get."
"00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,100","Like the whole game is written, every puzzle's designed, you know, all the art direction's completely done."
"00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,336","I've never in my whatever years I've worked in the game industry, ever seen that happen."
"00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,063",Some projects are closer to that than others.
"00:11:05,063 --> 00:11:07,543",So there's a lot of uncertainty at that point.
"00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,700","Stapley: Yeah, sounds good and scary."
"00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,279","Schafer: Bagel, why you so scared?"
"00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,996","Stapley: I think because I haven't seen anything like in the game yet, you know."
"00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,880",Like it's still the lumberjack dude.
"00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:26,471",I'd just love to see how easy it's going to be reshape things and put things in and take things out and change things and add things.
"00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:31,049","Petty: What you really have to do, I think, is lay the best foundation you can."
"00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:35,599",Be mindful of what you're making and then just be clever as you're making the game.
"00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,324",Look for opportunities to save time or to reuse things or to go in new directions that are just more efficient
"00:11:42,324 --> 00:11:46,324",or take some of the lessons you've learned from the earlier areas and adapt your later areas to it.
"00:11:46,324 --> 00:11:52,044","So, that's, and that's, that's what I try and do and I think most people on the team try to do it in any game."
"00:11:52,300 --> 00:12:03,064","[Music] Offscreen Voice: She wants to be skinny, right?"
"00:12:03,064 --> 00:12:03,744",And look skinny.
"00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:06,507",So maybe it's something that helps her look slimmer sometime?
"00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:08,527",Schafer: Corset. Offscreen Voice: Yeah.
"00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,427",Schafer: But you put corset on the buzzard.
"00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,659","Oh, wait. That could be awesome."
"00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,100",Offscreen Voice: That could be totally awesome.
"00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,720",Schafer: So strange. A corset buzzard with a drumstick in his arm.
"00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,521",This is where I start getting interested.
"00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:27,316","Schafer: Like I haven't seen like the maiden feast thing all wired up yet, but that is in the game, I hear."
"00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,461",Have you seen that?
"00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:30,001",I've been out of it in meetings.
"00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,821",Things are happening so fast.
"00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,344","Petty: You know what did so far in it, is you know, we had this sort of layout drawing that we did."
"00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:39,707",And we took those layout drawings and cut them up.
"00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:43,390",And you can sort of see things exist in the tool here in parallax.
"00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,706","We don't have the game camera authored or anything, like you know, you could rough in the game play right now if you wanted to."
"00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:50,455","This isn't the, a real monster design."
"00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,957",That's not a real bird design.
"00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:59,382","Those aren't real character designs, but they are, you know, they have the underlying script components to them."
"00:12:59,382 --> 00:13:03,985","And so, you know, once those, you can sort of see here this is just, if we run the game at this scene at the moment"
"00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:05,814",we don't actually have a main character.
"00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,524","So you know, one could hookup dialogue and have proxy object dragging and all that sort of stuff."
"00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:17,332","So that's the biggest thing I want to do with it, was put enough of it together that Bagel could do some painting and learn from the painting."
"00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,740",And if the programmers want to script that one first they can.
"00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,800","Franzke: Stuff should go time-wise like, well, at least roughly, right, you need those animations"
"00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,832","Kipnis: Think of the sound guys, that's what they use as well."
"00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,185","Petty: Well, this happened but their workflow, all they do, is they takeâ€¦"
"00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:35,520","Kipnis: Oh! [Power out] Schafer: Well, it is lunchtime."
"00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,000",Offscreen Voice: It could have been worse.
"00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:41,974",Offscreen Voice: Do you see yourself having a huge workload on this?
"00:13:41,974 --> 00:13:48,827","Crook: Yes. Yeah, we started going through it and I figure, I mean it's a Tim Schafer game."
"00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,187","He likes characters, he likes dialogue."
"00:13:51,187 --> 00:13:52,390",And there'll be cut scenes.
"00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,429",Crook: I don't know.
"00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:55,485",I'm not sure what Tim wants as far as fidelity on cut scenes.
"00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:56,765",Like I don't know.
"00:13:56,765 --> 00:13:58,336",Petty: The question is how Full Throttle are we?
"00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,876",Crook: Right. Right.
"00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,800","For an animator this is horrible. But, Franzke: I mean, like what if you could just do all that stuff in Maya"
"00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,920",Crook: We'll see how much of it we can auto-gen as far as like lip-sync and that sort of thing.
"00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,620","I just, I just hope, you know, sometimes you do something, you think, oh, we'll just automate it."
"00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,548","And then you do it and like ah, it's not going to work."
"00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:20,246","You know, we need to just have, you know, artists go in and do this."
"00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:26,851",Crook: So this was sort of a test animation that I did yesterday.
"00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,998",And so she's stuck in this cake.
"00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,771","And then this just shows you her turning, just to see what kind of, if we can get a quick turn out of her."
"00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:43,406",And so we already have the composition decided on so we know what the position of each of these characters will be in.
"00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:49,804","So when Bagel did the initial designs, which is here, he took that into consideration."
"00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:54,990",And so we know that she will never have to turn any more than what she does right there.
"00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:00,663","Rice: Just because that's kind of a whole new process, the 2D animation is something we haven't done here at Double Fine."
"00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,700",And we're doing it in a way that is similar to how we animate in 3D so that helps.
"00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,904",But that could easily be something that's a lot more work than we're expecting.
"00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:18,739","Petty: Yeah, I'm not sure how we're going to handle the tentacles because when we talked about maybe doing them purely as flip book animation,"
"00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:25,884","because we are, we don't have, we can't have enough joints in this engine to do, to like animate them all freely."
"00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,686",Schafer: Is there a special close-up monster different than the...?
"00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,370",Petty: We don't do any special close-up.
"00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,740","We do one version for everything unless we have to do it, because it's just a lot more work."
"00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,029",Schafer: Maybe not to joint everything that you don't want to joint.
"00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:40,149",Or is it the painting of the details or is the mouth shapes and all that stuff?
"00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:41,829",Petty: All the above.
"00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,298",Rice: We're still working on like our first playable puzzle from the actual game.
"00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,393",We kind of bit off a big one.
"00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,423",So that's happening now.
"00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,500","Crook: So you know, when I was creating lists and I've been working with Lee on schedule"
"00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,946","and it's, it's, it's going to get hairy, I think."
"00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:09,880","Petty: And then his overall layout of that area, I think this shows, this shows where it is relative to the village."
"00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,960",Schafer: Things look great.
"00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,580",Schafer: So we'll meet with Peter.
"00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:22,776","Chan: This is kind of the square, but I, you know, it could be a lot bigger, but I wanted to just show what it might look like down the street."
"00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,900","Schafer: I guess I'd like, I haven't seen any, I mean, I like the..."
"00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,360","Schafer: Yeah, some things are bugging me about those mushroom houses."
"00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,557","For one, I hate mushrooms."
"00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,453","But two, it's like, oh, mushroom houses."
"00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,398",What is that making me think of?
"00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,594",And I thought Smurfs.
"00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:47,279","Schafer: You know, my only worry about the mushroom town is if it invokes Smurfdom, you know, because there is that kind of Smurf shape with mushrooms a little bit."
"00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:55,119","So when I see the big castle's one big mushroom, you know, there's parts, there's shapes of mushrooms that don't evoke that and there's shapes that do."
"00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:57,119","Petty: Like this doesn't really, right? Chan: OK."
"00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,340","Schafer: No, that looks more like aâ€¦"
"00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:02,474",Chan: Greg? When is my last day?
"00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,262",Petty: August tenth. August tenth.
"00:17:04,262 --> 00:17:08,347",Chan: Wow. OK.
"00:17:08,347 --> 00:17:11,307","So then we are, it's... Rice: Getting there."
"00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:12,406",Chan: We're running out of time.
"00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,126",Schafer: Get drawing right now.
"00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,960","Chan: We've only just scratched the surface really, by that. We're still..."
"00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,680",Schafer: We'll get more money later and have you back.
"00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:32,116","Rice: You know, we got a lot of money but that money goes a lot of places and it's expensive to run a studio like Double Fine in San Francisco."
"00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,285",So there's only so long we can have this many people on the project without running out of money.
"00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:40,389",We've got to make sure that we make something great in that amount of time.
"00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,440",Schafer: OK.
"00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,060",Chan: Anything else? Schafer: Not me.
"00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,920","Petty: No, no. I'll call you soon."
"00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,780","Chan: OK, cool. I'm going to hang up."
"00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,320",You guys have a great rest of the day.
"00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,448","Schafer: Thanks, you too Peter. Bye."
"00:17:51,448 --> 00:17:53,008","Chan: OK, thank you, bye-bye."
"00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,460","Schafer: So like I really do like all this stuff, and this stuff."
"00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,861","And that all works, too."
"00:17:57,861 --> 00:18:01,374","Like I was, I hope I didn't hurt his feelings by saying Smurfs."
"00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,321",Sometimes you never know...Smurfs..
"00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:05,521",Petty: It's really hard not to offend artists all the time.
"00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:07,345",Schafer: But that's my only worry about some of this stuff.
"00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:12,562","Because I, I mean, I like it but he did go, like the very first thing that he ever talked about"
"00:18:12,562 --> 00:18:16,354",was this Japanese/Scandinavian combination mushroom thing.
"00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,949","And so it's really hard to say like I like it, but I had seen anything else, except I did also like"
"00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:26,091","some of Bagel's crazy geometric weird thing that he was doing, too."
"00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,218",That was kind of a unique look for the castle.
"00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,780","Yeah, I mean I know Bagel's got a lot of backgrounds to do but I would like to see if he could come up with any ideas about the buzzard."
"00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:39,900","Petty: So is Bagel, yeah, I mean, so what we have to do, like with, I guess we can talk about this in the reviews or review meeting,"
"00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:46,848","but Bagel right now, just, just to paint what we already designed for just the sacrifice puzzle will take him this entire sprint."
"00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:51,080","He doesn't, he really doesn't have time for, for any concept art at all."
"00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,530",He has time to interpret it like when he gets to like paint it and that's sort of built into the time.
"00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:00,300","And if, we can certainly do any of that but it comes at the cost of we either need to come up with another solution for painting that-"
"00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,750",Schafer: The problem with that is that doesn't really solve the problem of like having a game be in Bagel's style.
"00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:10,950","'Cause if he isn't doing the concept part of it, then it's not really, Petty: well I dissagree... Schafer: it's his rendering style but it's not his like..."
"00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,021",Petty: But that's what his painting is.
"00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:13,512",You're not using the content from his painting.
"00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,840","You're not using the ""Bob's Big Boy"" Schafer: When I talked about like wanting to capture"
"00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,740","some of the crazy stuff from his fine art show, there was a little guy on the table or the woman with the mouth in her hair."
"00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,362",Like those are more ideas than about a rendering style.
"00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:29,621","So like I wanted to capture some of Bagel's, some more surreal ideas in the game concept, too."
"00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,340","Not just, not just his rendering style, for sure."
"00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,148","Petty: Well then we need to come up with another plan, because right now it's not possible."
"00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,815","Schafer: But, 'cause I'm torn."
"00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,340","Because I also want Bagel to do concepts, like come up with crazy ideas."
"00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:49,860","That's one of the things I like about his art, is that he has these, you know, kind of crazy surreal ideas in his painting."
"00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,060",Not just the rendering style of it.
"00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:59,727","Rice: But yeah, I mean it was a hard choice, you know, when Tim decided that he wanted the game to reflect Bagel's style."
"00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:04,060","Ultimately that means that he's going to have to paint a lot of the game, if not all of the game."
"00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:09,900",And it's going to be what makes the game have kind of a cohesive feel and look.
"00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,700",Petty: I don't see how it's going to work.
"00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,680","So we could either do something like, you know, someone else could render the characters"
"00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,232","to give him time to do concept design or someone, I don't know."
"00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,931","Something like that, some hybrid sort of rendering style solution that can work in a very similar style."
"00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,786","That's the only, you know, we'll have to figure something like that out."
"00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,040",Because there just isn't time for one person to do all that.
"00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,997",Schafer: I love this meeting wherein we talk about can't be done.
"00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,040","Because those are always like, those are kind of a drag, 'cause you're like trying, you're trying to invent stuff."
"00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,413","You know, you're having this problem with nothing to something, like OK, I got an idea."
"00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,260",And someone says that'll take three years; you can't do it.
"00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,560",And you're like oh.
"00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,348",Do you know how hard that was to have that idea?
"00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,360","Schafer: OK, I have to go do something."
"00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,200",Petty: OK. So...
"00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,180",Schafer: As much as I would like to talk about how we can't make this awesome game in time.
"00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,440",Petty: I thought I was coming up with ways that we could.
"00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:13,020",Schafer: I know. I'm going to check out that inventory stuff.
"00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,620",Rice: Bye.
"00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,936","Schafer: Hey, Anna. Kipnis: Yeah?"
"00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,020",Can I see all that cool inventory stuff I missed?
"00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,380",Petty: We're just going to wind up shipping a game about a red bot and a fucking lumberjack.
"00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,159","Sorry, Tim."
"00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,088",We decided to ship these instead.
"00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:34,090",Crook: Ran out of time.
"00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,430",Franzke: We ran out of time. We did create all kind of tech for it...
"00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,719",Thank God it's up to you to make a game.
"00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,960","Here's a tool set, go do whatever you want."
"00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:48,241","Rice: Yeah, I think there's always a point in a project where everything kind of gets real and you see the amount of work"
"00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:50,005",that you have in front of you.
"00:21:50,005 --> 00:21:56,920",There was a bit of an eye-opener just through the docs and the processes as far as how much work is left.
"00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,607","And how much we can, we can do."
"00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:02,167",And the amount of time we have left.
"00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,207","Rice: It was an eye-opener that we needed to get to the moment where we're like OK, we need to start building this game."
"00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:15,280","And we're getting to the point where yeah, where now the real work is beginning."
"00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,860","Schafer: Who was it, it was like Miyamoto."
"00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,340","He said that famous quote about like it only hurts until it's done, but if it sucks, it sucks forever, you know."
"00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,179","Schafer: So like OK, we'll suffer now, we'll put the extra work in to make this great,"
"00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:32,948","because no one's going to remember, you know, no one ever says about a game like, oh you know, that game had a really reasonable production cycle."
"00:22:32,948 --> 00:22:34,260","That was, I really enjoyed that game."
"00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,860",It was really moderately scheduled.
"00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,073",Rice: This was our fourth milestone of 13.
"00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:49,061","So we need to start kind of pushing forward, getting some content together if we're going to stay on track."
"00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:52,557","Schafer: I mean, off of what I'm pushing for is like we should just think about this problem longer,"
"00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,316","because we're going to have a creative solution that's going to allow us to have the great thing that I want,"
