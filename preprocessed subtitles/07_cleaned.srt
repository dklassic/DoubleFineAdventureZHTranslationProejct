1
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:31,379
Stamos: Just even taking like what's the new schedule out of it for a second, it's like can we finish the game for, you know, the remaining amount of money?

2
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:38,827
Because I think we're in a situation where we need to significantly increase our funding for this game.

3
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:42,067
Or significantly reduce the scope of the game.

4
00:00:42,838 --> 00:01:12,380
[Music] Rice: OK.

5
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,936
Stamos: That said, really talking about the overall schedule.

6
00:01:15,936 --> 00:01:19,696
Right now the overall schedule for Red's is posted as April.

7
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:28,124
And I think there's a sense from the team that that's not actually a feasible timeframe.

8
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,938
Min: I think, I think just the larger goal is when, like hey, when's our Alpha?

9
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,639
What's that mean?

10
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,322
When's our Beta?

11
00:01:36,322 --> 00:01:37,395
When do we ship?

12
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,940
When's that, our big trailer coming.

13
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,041
Those are sort of like, like the few hi level stuff that I like to kind of get an idea of.

14
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,779
When are the ports coming online?

15
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:51,740
So it does worry me, because that does make a big difference in terms of what to do now.

16
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,819
Crook: And for me, like dates and things, just working here for this long...

17
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:02,680
I've just gotten used to things change and so I don't freak out.

18
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:10,120
And I think, you know, there were times where it was, yeah, we've had people freak out and like leave because they freaked out.

19
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:16,880
And so I kind of learned that, you just sort of, we'll figure it out.

20
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,760
Stamos: Not enough of work has been done for the team to have confidence that they're really halfway through.

21
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:31,052
Stamos: And I think there's a lot of work to do still, to understand really what the scope is,

22
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,500
but it's coming into, it's coming into view.

23
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:38,571
I think it's expanded a lot from what they originally thought.

24
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:47,754
And when projects evolve like that, you need to really reevaluate the plans.

25
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:52,851
So having a clear plan in place that you can iterate on is a good start.

26
00:02:52,851 --> 00:03:01,533
So I want to get like the tools in place and help Greg get the tools in place to have that, so that there's a plan that he can easily iterate on.

27
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,673
So that's mostly what I'm helping with.

28
00:03:03,981 --> 00:03:10,865
Stamos: Job number one is to make this game awesome, because it's just too important to do anything else.

29
00:03:11,363 --> 00:03:16,123
First steps first is to figure out at least where we're landing.

30
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,460
And so that's not pick a date and work back from that.

31
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,969
It is more of a bottoms-up.

32
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:30,446
Let's map out everything that we know about the game and then really see how long it will take.

33
00:03:30,446 --> 00:03:33,180
Schafer: Like can we do that before this milestone is over or after?

34
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:41,560
'Cause what we'll find out in this milestone is if we can bring, if we can bring, Cloud Colony to Alpha to Beta that'll mean something.

35
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,216
Not the end of all our problems, but it'll mean something.

36
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:48,958
If we can't bring it to Beta, that'll be even more informative in a way.

37
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:53,160
Schafer: But I never believe that we're going to be late, but I've been late before, a couple times.

38
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,120
Three or four. Every time, most of the times.

39
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,261
So we really want to prove that we can get the Cloud Colony done this month so we can prove that we're, we're picking up the pace

40
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:04,481
and we're, you know, we can finish stuff.

41
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:09,604
Schafer: It's great. I mean this is what I've been waiting for, it's been really frustrating to be in the writing cave

42
00:04:09,604 --> 00:04:11,247
and the designing cave for a long time.

43
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:16,456
'Cause it's like work's being done on the game and I'm not participating in it.

44
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,439
and now I'm getting much more, being much more participatory.

45
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:29,283
And I feel like, I feel like I'm able to point at what needs to get done and push on it to get it done more.

46
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:36,139
Schafer: There's two things like for me, now the first one was pretty much the same as this is, but it's just like harder to list out.

47
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,793
Things that I'm looking to find answers for.

48
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,780
'Cause I want find answers to almost everything, like is the game working?

49
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,848
Is the game right?

50
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:46,968
Is it, like you have this feeling after the sprint and like that's exactly what the game's going to look like,

51
00:04:47,383 --> 00:04:50,223
but as far, as close as we can except for the things that are obviously we can't.

52
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:50,848
That's the first one.

53
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:54,511
The second one sounds like, it sounds like a disagreement but it's not a disagreement.

54
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,400
It's really just working at it from the other end.

55
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,337
It's that I really want the Cloud Colony be done.

56
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,801
I mean like done with the Cloud Colony, 'cause we've been working on it for long time

57
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,309
and we have a lot of other areas to get to.

58
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:08,834
And so I want to have it be, as much as possible, have the approach of like we're not coming back to the Cloud Colony.

59
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,441
I want to be approaching it like we're finishing off in terms of Beta, you know.

60
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:18,160
Schafer: So we're going to go, actually go through the game play and make sure we itemize all the things that need to be done.

61
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,420
Franzke: That's the idea.

62
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,763
All right.

63
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:22,577
And you were, Greg is the official note taker.

64
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,740
Rice: Yes. Schafer: OK.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,852
So I'm trying to solve a puzzle.

66
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,518
I'm trying to make Jessie like me.

67
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:30,240
Jessie doesn't like me.

68
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,580
So when you go over here and you interact with Jessie, where the hell did I go?

69
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,360
There, what's that?

70
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,100
What was that?

71
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,500
Kipnis: That's if you click off the nav mesh or something like that.

72
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,180
Like that, that happens.

73
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,220
Schafer: Her turning animation's a little much.

74
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,240
Kipnis: It's a little much? Do you want it to be shorter?

75
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,191
Schafer: Well, it makes it really unresponsive that she has to do that turn.

76
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,120
You kind of want her to just move right away.

77
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,264
Rice: Play-throughs are awesome, yeah.

78
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:56,256
'Cause it gets everybody in the same room together looking at it at the same time.

79
00:05:56,739 --> 00:06:03,561
It like nails Tim down to where like he has to like sit there and play it with everybody in a room and get directly like,

80
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:05,452
point out the things that he's not happy with.

81
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:12,598
Because I mean, he plays it a lot and he'll send the email feedback and he'll bring things up in stand-ups and stuff.

82
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,787
But it's nice to just be able to sit there and like everybody see it on the screen together

83
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:20,727
and like know the things that he is not happy with and that need work.

84
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,950
Schafer: So first I have to solve that puzzle.

85
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,590
So I come back here and I'm like...

86
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:31,920
[Groans] Schafer: So task for Oliver, make that crash optional.

87
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,940
Franzke: All right. Optional crash system.

88
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,223
The game has encountered a problem.

89
00:06:36,223 --> 00:06:37,423
Do you want to crash now?

90
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:41,323
No. All right. Game is recovered.

91
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:49,000
[Music] Schafer: One of the hard things about making an adventure game

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,940
is that the team doesn't often find the game fun when they're working on it.

93
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,052
It's not like a first person shooter where even if you're working on a first person shooter, it's fun to play it.

94
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,221
But an adventure game, you know all the solutions, all the puzzles and you know all the jokes.

95
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:05,021
So there's no like discovery or you know, you know, wonder or...

96
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:08,347
It's fun to see it come together and it's fun to see that you're making something good.

97
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,775
But you don't stay late.

98
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,440
No one's going to stay late to like play Red's after, after hours.

99
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,480
Hey, you want to play Red's?

100
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,600
Yeah, let's do it.

101
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,420
Let's hook it up.

102
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,562
'Cause like, oh, yeah, I know.

103
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,182
This is the puzzle I wired up.

104
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,004
So and that's always been sad.

105
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,319
Schafer: OK. I'm trying to remember how to actually make games.

106
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,420
I'm trying to program.

107
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,460
First let me get all the latest stuff.

108
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,160
It's syncing up.

109
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,500
Now I'm going to run the game.

110
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,600
Never actually done this before.

111
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,560
This is gonna be embarrassing.

112
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,180
We should film the second time I do this.

113
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,660
'Cause the second time I'll be like [makes computer noises]

114
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,200
oh, this is Unix. I know this.

115
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,844
[computer noises] Offscreen Voice: Is that Jurassic Park?

116
00:07:52,844 --> 00:07:54,216
Schafer: That Jurassic Park joke.

117
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,228
Is that getting too old to make that reference?

118
00:07:56,228 --> 00:08:00,023
I'm hoping I can actually just enter dialogue myself into the engine.

119
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,080
'Cause you know, when you, you know, for a long time from Psychonauts and Brutal Legend stuff,

120
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,845
I'd write dialogue and then someone like Anna or Kee or someone would have to come and implement it.

121
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,693
But then you don't get to really like tweak it.

122
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,620
Like I like to put stuff in and then see how the timing works out and then mess with it.

123
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,520
And also it'd be nice while I was writing if I didn't think I was just creating a whole bunch of work for someone else to do.

124
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,479
It'd be great if I could, if I'm going to put it into Excel or if I'm going to put it into a database,

125
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,180
I might as well just put it into the game.

126
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,458
And then I'm not creating work for, you know, that way Anna can work on something else and I can just do this.

127
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,860
And also at my age I really would like to learn something so I don't have Alzheimer's.

128
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,959
But I think it's too late.

129
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,464
I think I have it 'cause I can't figure out at all what's happening.

130
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,420
How do I open this scene?

131
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,560
How do I open?

132
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,840
Open in project?

133
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,500
That's a bunch of things.

134
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,680
Can you believe I have a CS degree?

135
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,020
Class of '89.

136
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,100
Voice.

137
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,840
X vertical Font.

138
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,140
Where's the dialogue?

139
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,420
Where's your dialogue?

140
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,634
I'm going to go ask her really quick.

141
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,020
I'll be right back.

142
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,300
Schafer: And then I'll totally be able to program this entire game myself.

143
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,680
I got it.

144
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,160
I totally had it all figured out.

145
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,700
Wait...

146
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,780
This looks totally different than on her computer.

147
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,380
Why did she set me up like this?

148
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,400
She totally lied to me.

149
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,740
I'm going to have to go back there and ask her again.

150
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,600
Ugh.

151
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,020
Schafer: Like in theory, me being able to program my own dialogue in the game would save time.

152
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,420
It's not there quite yet.

153
00:09:55,185 --> 00:10:00,320
See, I'm taking up Anna's time but it's going to save her time later, when I can program the entire game myself.

154
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,180
Let's see if I remember anything that Anna showed me.

155
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,860
I don't remember anything that Anna showed me.

156
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,100
It's annoying because I did touch stuff and now I don't know if I touched something.

157
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,000
I pretty much reverted everything I touched.

158
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,520
Schafer: So embarrassing.

159
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,120
Schafer: I got it. I'm in.

160
00:10:20,014 --> 00:10:21,215
I've hacked the mainframe.

161
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:26,595
I'm totally, I'm seeing all the beauty that is Red's simultaneously at once.

162
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,600
Well, that's a day's work. Done.

163
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:36,269
Schafer: But there's this pressure to, we got to meet the milestone.

164
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,429
I just got to get all this writing done.

165
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,549
I can't be messing around with like this stuff.

166
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:46,738
So I changed gears and just focus on getting all the dialogue done and it means that Anna has to spend a lot of time implementing it,

167
00:10:49,144 --> 00:10:57,988
but the question is will there be a point where I can actually, you know, get up and running enough on the programming to make that efficient?

168
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,020
I don't know.

169
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,820
Kipnis: There's just a lot more content, I think, in these, in Cloud Colony than there has been in the other stuff that we've had.

170
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,460
And it's a lot of work to get it all implemented.

171
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:17,019
Crook: I don't know. It'll be all right.

172
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,428
It'll be OK. It's always this way.

173
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:30,485
Ryken: It's, I think back the first game that I worked on was Brutal Legend and that was, that was my concept for what, you know, games are like, you know.

174
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:33,485
And in this one it's like, it's not going to take four and a half years?

175
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,880
Sounds like a good game for me.

176
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,694
But yeah, there's a lot of iteration in the beginning and then you find, you get closer to the spirit of the game

177
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:52,433
and I feel like when the game starts gelling together, kind of like the way just recently the girl got a shadow.

178
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,960
And I was like happier than high hell that Just the smallest little thing goes into the game and it,

179
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,644
it's no longer just this, this animated stick figure walking around.

180
00:12:04,644 --> 00:12:11,972
It's gelling it together and it gets exciting, it gets exciting because like those things are going to be there as we're carving out

181
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,400
those little connectors to the world that you're walking in, you know.

182
00:12:17,307 --> 00:12:23,127
They're going to be there when we start on new areas already and you're going to have a feel for walking through the spaces

183
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,720
and it's really cool.

184
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,805
Schafer: Look at that sinking!

185
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:26,969
That's awesome.

186
00:12:26,969 --> 00:12:28,045
I can't save her!

187
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:29,816
I can't save her, I can't save her! Get up!

188
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,720
Oh my God, I've had this dream.

189
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,113
Schafer: No, I get more excited about this game every day because as it starts to come together,

190
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,298
because we started from just scratch, it's cool to actually see it become real, you know.

191
00:12:39,538 --> 00:12:45,694
Because of the framerate I can't click anywhere Schafer: But I think the game is looking a lot better,

192
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,914
the characters are really pretty.

193
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,340
The backgrounds are getting better and better looking.

194
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,401
And you know, we're starting to see the basic interface working now.

195
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,425
And with music in, you know, it's starting to really feel like a real adventure game.

196
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,860
Ryken: And I was just doing the flat paint over on the art that we had that Lee did, sent out.

197
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,553
Schafer: All right, everybody.

198
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,500
Let us break.

199
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,680
And let us do this again next week.

200
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,433
Stapley: So yesterday I was just sort of going through and painting a bunch of the scenes files.

201
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,684
And now I'm just addressing all that feedback from the walk-through, play-through.

202
00:13:22,684 --> 00:13:26,730
Ryken: Yesterday I was drawing hands for the girl and then I got sick of drawing hands for the girl.

203
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,950
So I stopped drawing hands for the girl.

204
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,440
Hands are the worst!

205
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,254
Why does anybody want to do hands?

206
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,460
Petty: So now she has hooks?

207
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,826
Ryken: Yeah. She's always going like this.

208
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:44,180
Fietzek: And yesterday I did some last final changes on the forum post, which is online now.

209
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,940
So also, this is my last stand-up, which is so sad.

210
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,860
And yeah. You know, like I, yeah, I want to say a tiny bit.

211
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:03,569
I'm not so good at this, but just a big thank you to all of you guys.

212
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:06,549
It's been an amazing three months.

213
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,020
You guys are all amazing and amazing people.

214
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:20,560
I'm so thankful for that internship and I did a group picture of us.

215
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,040
Kipnis: Awww!

216
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,040
Franzke: That's awesome.

217
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,740
[Laughter] Everyone on the team, including you guys.

218
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,940
Kipnis: Aww dude, thanks a lot. Bagel: Lets just scan that in.

219
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,400
Fietzek: I'll send it around.

220
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,300
Kipnis: Should we make it poster size?

221
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,320
Fietzek: It should be big enough.

222
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,160
Petty: Thank you, Marius.

223
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,255
Thank you for all your hard work here.

224
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,940
It's been awesome having you here.

225
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:55,560
[Applause] Schafer: I thought we might be able to convince Marius to stay

226
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,510
because we would have had to just derail his education as I said, but there was, I was not expecting the real reason

227
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,426
he was going back to Germany, which was for love.

228
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,940
And though we are evil enough to end education, we could not fight the force that is love.

229
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,785
Schafer: We were trying to set up a contract where he could keep doing what he's doing from Germany, making animatics for us.

230
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:20,280
It's kind of like when Scott Campbell and Nathan moved to New York.

231
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:28,851
I would just try and keep those guys working for us because I, you don't, you know, people, people who are talented people

232
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,960
don't come around every day and you got to like hang onto them when you can.

233
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,480
Marius: Yeah. I can try coming back next year.

234
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:56,540
[Music] Schafer: I feel like now we're actually moving at the speed that we're moving at.

235
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,082
As soon as they get all locked down with the process between Bagel and Levi and Lee,

236
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:04,784
I think it'll be, feel like we're moving at a good clip.

237
00:16:05,258 --> 00:16:07,634
Offscreen Voice: So you're back?

238
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,934
Stapley: I'm back in action. Red's.

239
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,780
No way man.

240
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,740
Tim should wear my hat.

241
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:30,425
[Music] Stapley: I'd like to actually get involved more with like concept stuff, though.

242
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:33,265
Yeah, I feel like I'm just kind of a painter.

243
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,360
Petty: Well, you and I talked about that, right?

244
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,927
And you said you, Stapley: Yeah, yeah, but like...

245
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:44,626
Petty: you wanted to do, Stapley: the way it's turning with, because all the designs are approved, so it's basically like, it's approved.

246
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,820
You know what I mean?

247
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,211
Petty: Individuals have changed what they wanted to do.

248
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:51,465
You know, initially Bagel did want to do a lot of painting.

249
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:59,840
And I think as we started getting into that, he felt like hey, you know, I really want to be more on the compositional side, which is fine, you know.

250
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,360
But that means we're going to have to shift things around.

251
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,500
Petty: Do you think this process is going to make that better?

252
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,095
Stapley: Which process?

253
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,299
Petty: Whatever, we're sort of being non-specific...

254
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,900
Stapley: I think having more hands painting and oh, well, I don't know.

255
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:17,359
I think I would feel, well, at least if we're going to say like this is Bagel's style of game,

256
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:25,541
then I would, yeah, at least I would have a little bit more like yeah, you know, that is my stuff.

257
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,360
Stapley: Like this sacrifice scene.

258
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,860
This is actually, I did the layout in this one and the camera angles.

259
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,689
And I feel good how that went.

260
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,449
Offscreen Voice: It's more Bagel.

261
00:17:35,449 --> 00:17:37,789
Stapley: Yeah, I feel, yeah, like this is maybe more Bagel.

262
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,380
A little bit.

263
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,480
Petty: Click down, like just double click towards the bottom so she walks down there.

264
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,380
Schafer: What the? Whoa..!

265
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,762
Schafer: Yeah, I like the, the first tested out was the sacrifice area, the new method.

266
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:53,905
And I really liked that.

267
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:56,405
It's pretty and I like that whole setup.

268
00:17:56,405 --> 00:18:01,400
I like the crazy big bird cages that are moved and ripped open and I think those are cool.

269
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,945
So it's promising.

270
00:18:02,945 --> 00:18:09,600
Stapley: Yeah. So now it's just, I guess there's just a question of like talking to Levi and Lee this week

271
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,360
and figuring out the paint, how to make it look consistent, you know.

272
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,280
That's, I think, the big major thing right now.

273
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,300
All right, you know, that's the thing, a worrisome thing that we should work on.

274
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:25,866
Petty: So this is the very old one, right?

275
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:27,266
Based on the color key.

276
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:32,745
So, I painted this one entirely with a charcoal brush, 'cause when we started I thought that's what we're doing on that one.

277
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:36,068
So it's, I think it's, it's a little too linear.

278
00:18:36,068 --> 00:18:38,472
It's too charcoal-y and colors are all wrong.

279
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,332
Petty: It's been difficult.

280
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,005
It's weird, it's weird finding out which area, why it's been difficult.

281
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,840
Part of it has been has been, he's evolving his own approach, to like the clouds specifically is very different than

282
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,602
sort of what painted the lumberjack.

283
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:56,334
So as his approach has been evolving, I've been trying to like paint this way and we've been changing it back and forth.

284
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,858
Petty: I kind of feel I knew the way we should try handling this one is, if you, say take this scene

285
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:05,558
and do like a line drawing composition and then do like a little small color key.

286
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,260
And then we give it to Levi and have him try and paint it.

287
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:16,061
Ryken: I feel like we wouldn't need that much of a color key, considering we were coming from an establishing shot already.

288
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:21,312
Petty: We've been doing other things as well, as like, you know, I have brush sets that I made basing on he likes to use in Photoshop

289
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,640
and we're kind of updating those.

290
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,480
So those can be given to all the artists that are painting digitally.

291
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,512
It's difficult.

292
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:34,362
I mean, I think one of the reasons why it made sense to have him paint stuff on the back end is it was,

293
00:19:34,362 --> 00:19:37,027
it would have been, he'd be the last person touching each asset.

294
00:19:37,027 --> 00:19:40,427
So it's necessarily just going to be more unified stylistically.

295
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:49,322
But by moving him to the front, it creates more, it probably gives the overall sense of things a little more quirkiness that he would have.

296
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:54,002
But it means we have more potential like consistency drifting going on, on the backside.

297
00:19:55,175 --> 00:19:58,535
But yeah, I think it's been, everything's been moving pretty well actually.

298
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,901
I'd say we made lots of really good progress this sprint.

299
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:04,981
Dillon: Like I'm actually really happy with the progress that we made in terms of this stuff.

300
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,080
We got a bunch of big features in and the tool's a lot better, kind of stuff.

301
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,200
Rice: Just the little things, too, just like the cameras feel so much better.

302
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,412
Just navigating around is way better now.

303
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,060
Dillon: It's just one of those things where it's like, you know, getting a basic system in there is easy and

304
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,360
giving it enough love so that it actually feels good is hard.

305
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,320
Like having milestones like this where we're really focused on polishing up an area,

306
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:34,480
is a forcing function for like we have a camera system but what we actually need is a good camera system.

307
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,540
[Laughter] Rice: Yeah.

308
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,080
Dillon: So I think we may have gotten a lot of traction in a lot of different areas and that stuff this time around.

309
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,260
Rice: Cool. Thanks, bro.

310
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,813
Rice: Oh, what? How successful is the Cloud Colony stuff gonna be?

311
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,979
Yeah, how close are you going to be to it actually being finished .

312
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,700
Rice: Well, I think we'll have a better idea of that after I go around and talk to everybody, which I'm going to do right now.

313
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,680
Crook: But it's nice.

314
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,460
This is working, which is really great to have.

315
00:21:04,217 --> 00:21:05,777
So you know, Rice: Yeah.

316
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,160
Three weeks ago we didn't have any cut scenes.

317
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:14,917
Crook: It's been sort of stuttering and going, you know, but that's smoothing out so we're making progress.

318
00:21:15,412 --> 00:21:17,552
Just not as fast as we would like.

319
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,360
Johnstone: So he's cleaned up. Rice: She.

320
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,000
Johnstone: She, she. She's cleaned up.

321
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,400
And I'm really done in like five minutes.

322
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,387
Rice: Sweet. Johnstone: Jessie's.

323
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,487
Rice: Awesome. Cool.

324
00:21:30,487 --> 00:21:31,508
Johnstone: So that's where I'm in.

325
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:32,543
That's where I'm at.

326
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:33,503
Rice: Perfect.

327
00:21:33,503 --> 00:21:34,863
Why is raining on your screen?

328
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:39,403
Johnstone: Oh. It's rainy moods as a soundtrack.

329
00:21:39,408 --> 00:21:40,488
It's nice.

330
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,580
Sometimes it's nice to listen to ambient noise.

331
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,840
Rice: Cool.

332
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,380
Johnstone: So why not?

333
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,980
Rice: This isn't going as fast as I was hoping it would.

334
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,960
Miss Kipnis, I'm coming to you.

335
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:03,484
Kipnis: So I mean, I don't, there's no way I'm going to get through my entire list, but I'll get, you know, I'll get as much as I can.

336
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,330
Rice: Cool. Cool.

337
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,070
Petty: You know, there's not a ton left.

338
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,664
I mean, I'm pretty much on schedule.

339
00:22:08,664 --> 00:22:12,125
I'm running a little behind but it's only theoretically behind.

340
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,245
Rice: Sounds good, man. Petty: Yeah.

341
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:17,143
Rice: We'll see how the play-through goes tomorrow.

342
00:22:17,488 --> 00:22:23,120
Schafer: Before we start, I'm going to guess that, like our goal was to finish Cloud Colony this sprint.

343
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:26,426
I have a feeling it's not finished.

344
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,133
Rice: You might be right.

345
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,080
Schafer: Oh man.

346
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,066
I haven't even, we have like another two week sprint that it would be great if we could finish Cloud Colony in that.

347
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:35,866
I don't want to just keep setting up the team to fail, though.

348
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:38,066
Like OK you guys, we're going to finish Cloud Colony this sprint.

349
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,682
OK, I didn't do it.

350
00:22:39,682 --> 00:22:41,362
OK, this time we're definitely going to finish. OK, no.

351
00:22:41,362 --> 00:22:43,769
That didn't work either, but OK, this sprint is the one.

352
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,400
So I don't want to say that, but there still is a lot to do.

353
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,340
I mean, you can't right now play the three puzzle branches, any of them to the end.

354
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:58,340
Rice: So yeah. Try to figure out now what you'll be looking at.

355
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:01,752
Schafer: Yeah.

356
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:13,420
So we don't know what's going to happen because, even if this sprint did finish, if we'd finish Cloud Colony we'd be looking at like,

357
00:23:14,158 --> 00:23:16,628
looking at the design of the game and how much time we have.

358
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:20,108
That we would not probably finish the game in April as we had previously thought.

359
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:26,086
Rice: Um hm. Schafer: Which we're still thinking we're going to finish in April, Rice: No. Schafer: we've done some math that means, Rice: We did some equations.

360
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:33,246
Schafer: And if we go past April that would mean going past our money that we got from Kickstarter, which would be not great to do.

361
00:23:34,632 --> 00:23:39,269
We're having discussions with Isa and Justin about what, how we want to deal with that.

362
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:47,380
So I don't think we're going to conclude any of that in this meeting, but that's the problem that we're working on outside of this, too.

363
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,100
Schafer: So see how much we did get done.

364
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,680
Rice: Yes. So there's, I have two files on Google Drive.

365
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,001
One is the budget, one is schedule.

366
00:24:01,344 --> 00:24:07,528
The original schedule that we made was like an attempt to get as many people on the team as we can

367
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:12,127
and try to include like all of the things outside of that camp that we need to pay for.

368
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,749
And then like fit a game into that time, essentially right.

369
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:24,942
And like as we were progressing like it was obvious that we weren't tracking to anything that was going to fit in that time.

370
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:31,091
So now the hope is to try to start from scratch on a new schedule, taking in account like what we've seen with Cloud Colony

371
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,950
and how long it's taken us to do that.

372
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,175
How many other additional screens and areas are left in the game as its currently spec'd

373
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:46,140
and try to take a new stab based on what we know now, at how long we think it'll actually take to make the game that you are designing.

374
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:54,919
Stamos: So the new budget for this scenario includes going all the way to September and the increased team size,

375
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:58,406
which the increased team size is, you know, like four or five people.

376
00:24:58,406 --> 00:25:01,610
Bailey: And has like 1.1 million dollars more costs.

377
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:08,454
Stamos: Yes. But the thing about this schedule is that it assumes at a certain point that systems work gets done

378
00:25:08,868 --> 00:25:18,285
and that the team gains efficiency and the number of scenes almost doubles at a certain point in the project in order to get it done.

379
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:21,825
So it's actually pretty aggressive.

380
00:25:21,825 --> 00:25:23,705
Bailey: Then I have to go find, I need to find money.

381
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:28,693
Stamos: Yeah. That is the concern.

382
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,275
Bailey: OK. Because right now, you know, it looks like, you know, the plane's kind of diving down a little bit

383
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,980
and we just need to, we have time to pull up.

384
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,137
Schafer: What does the plane diving down stand for?

385
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,844
Bailey: That's, just
Schafer: Us crashing?
Bailey: Yeah.

386
00:25:39,844 --> 00:25:41,566
Schafer: The whole company crashing into the ground.

387
00:25:41,566 --> 00:25:48,842
Is that what you're saying or are you being, Bailey: I mean, the nicest, so the thing is that Red's, this project is,

388
00:25:49,287 --> 00:25:52,142
it's going to determine the studio's success going forward.

389
00:25:52,142 --> 00:25:56,048
It's a major portion of my forecast of the health of the studio.

390
00:25:56,048 --> 00:26:06,633
It hitting next year is absolutely necessary and how successful it is once it, you know, is out there and it's live, you know,

391
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,800
determines our ability to be independent and kind of have our own creative control, like that we're enjoying now.

392
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,820
So...

393
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,600
Schafer: It just seems wrong to make it cost more than we got.

394
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,400
Because we were so lucky to get the money that we got, because I'm going to feel like this moral thing to finish it

395
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,266
for that amount of money or less.

396
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,420
And I'm sure our business guy would love for us to finish for less.

397
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,685
But the game also has to be really good.

398
00:26:33,685 --> 00:26:35,571
And it is an important game to the studio.

399
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,880
And strategically it's an important game for us because we own it.

400
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:44,700
We will, we don't have to share the money with any sort of other party, investor or publisher, you know, it's all ours.

401
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,400
So it makes sense for us to make a really good game.

402
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,607
Bailey: We have to, we have to deliver on the vision and I don't think it's going to be done in the budget.

403
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,900
So we have to find more money.

404
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,623
And I feel like not only does it need to deliver on what the community is hoping it is

405
00:27:01,623 --> 00:27:09,739
and the people that actually backed it, but the whole community in general and the crowd funding that's actually occurred since then, we're the poster child.

406
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,488
And we're the poster child, you know, succeed or fail.

407
00:27:12,488 --> 00:27:16,174
And so, you know, we'd like to see more games funded this way.

408
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:21,079
Rice: I think it's also just important to keep in mind that there's like other impacts besides just funding the game.

409
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:27,817
And that like if we now go get a publisher for this game then it's suddenly like voids everything we've said about the project

410
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,533
and everything we're trying to do.

411
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,930
It's hard and I know like we're looking at a number that's large, that we're saying we need.

412
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:39,093
But like as much as possible just trying to make sure that it's as good of money as this money was.

413
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:47,671
Bailey: I think, you know, there are, obviously there are financial realities that we have to be conscious of, but I mean the reality is that, you know,

414
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,160
it needs to be a Double Fine game and the quality and it has to deliver on Tim's vision

415
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:57,110
and so it comes back to, you know, can we, what would be like the minimum scope of the game

416
00:27:57,327 --> 00:28:01,798
that you would feel it's still, delivers on how you envisioned it.

417
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:07,049
Schafer: I mean, every time I've been up against this kind of situation, which is almost every time, there's scope

418
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:15,663
and then there's money, then there's efficiencies and I've never seen this solved any other way than all of the above.

419
00:28:15,663 --> 00:28:16,861
Stamos: Yeah. Schafer: You know what I mean?

420
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,679
Some scope reduction, some efficiency improvements, some extra money.

421
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,020
Not like any one of those things being the answer.

422
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,160
Bailey: Ok. Ok.

423
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,760
Rice: We can get it done.

424
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,040
Bailey: Should we do like an all hands in and team?

425
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,480
[Laughter] Rice: Yeah man.

426
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,100
Rice: OK.

427
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,960
Bailey: Alright guys.

428
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,980
Rice: OK. Let's keep those.

429
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:02,840
Rice: Ultimately the number one decider in the schedule is when do we feel like we have a game that we're proud of.

430
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:11,440
So it's trying to figure out the best plan of attack to get us to where we feel proud of the game and are ready to put it out.

431
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,700
But I think we're safe to assume at this point that it's definitely past April.

432
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,580
So we just gotta kind of figure out when that is.

433
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,980
And how we're going to get there.

434
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,980
We'll handle it.

435
00:29:31,100 --> 00:30:26,860
[Music] Schafer: What we've really done

436
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:33,744
is we've really banked the entire company on this one project and if even one thing goes wrong, it'll take down the whole games industry.

437
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:40,060
Is that kind of what you're, or you mean it like more like a Phil Fish thing?

438
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,384
Now that, you're gonna use that.

439
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:44,364
That's when you know.

440
00:30:44,364 --> 00:30:45,924
Listen, that was copyright Phil Fish.

441
00:30:45,924 --> 00:30:46,884
I can't do that.
