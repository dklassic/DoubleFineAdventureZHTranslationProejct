1
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,900
Stapley: Yeah, that's pretty. Pretty colors.

2
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,320
Stapley: Yeah, I was looking at the end there.

3
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,733
The 20th of September, October, November, December, January, February, March, April.

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,800
So yeah, everything looks cool here.

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,760
Yeah, those last three months right there seems like there's going to be a lot of changing.

6
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,060
[Laughs} From November to February looks a little crazy.

7
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah man. It's going to be pretty nuts.

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:51,280
[Music] [quite fantasy music]

9
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,196
Petty: Well, then we need to come up with another plan because right now it's not possible.

10
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,878
There's just not, one artist can't be the primary, like he's the, he's the, you know, like literally he's the renderer for every object in the game.

11
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,211
And do concept design on the schedule we have.

12
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:11,255
Schafer: I think if I hadn't been through the process before, I'd think the project was falling apart last month.

13
00:02:11,255 --> 00:02:15,964
It definitely is a little bit of a tension as you switch gears and you're talking about practical matters.

14
00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:20,345
But it wasn't that tense, you know.

15
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,102
Petty: For all the artists involved but certainly for Bagel, we're going to have make, you're going to have decide, I guess,

16
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,120
which, what you want the hierarchy of his time to be spent on.

17
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:36,042
[Ambient sci-fi music] Schafer: I want him to come up with both the, you know,

18
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:42,750
that really just like content and then actual style, both.

19
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,704
Petty: There's other options there, that we talked about all those options.

20
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:48,724
I don't think we've committed to one particular solution yet.

21
00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:52,684
Rice: I think it's an ongoing conversation, so not really.

22
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,768
Schafer: I mean yeah, we're doing, since we're doing a game that's like a different engine type than we've ever done before, it's like 2D.

23
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:16,220
A whole different engine, new devices we'd never worked on and an adventure game, which we would have never made a straight adventure game here at this company.

24
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,506
So we're doing so many new things with this project that we're just learning.

25
00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:23,867
Every time we try to do something, we find out like that's not going to work.

26
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,233
We do have to, of course, correct and try different solutions.

27
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,920
But that's totally normal, expected.

28
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,960
Offscreen Voice: Don't fuck with my wall.

29
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,240
Rice: But I mean, like a lot of it isn't like, there's a problem, we're fucked.

30
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:42,540
It's like we need to pay attention to this and try to start figuring out ways to make it work.

31
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,323
And we started thinking about that and feeling more comfortable.

32
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,927
Schafer: Well, we have, we brought on Levi and he's helping out.

33
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,726
Rice: We have some new people, but like they're getting familiar with everything pretty quickly.

34
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:58,301
Ryken: I was actually, on Friday I was looking at this.

35
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,080
Just getting inspired.

36
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,383
This is the museum near Tokyo.

37
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:06,853
It's super cool and I went there and I bought that there.

38
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,916
And for Friday, I just, the first thing in the morning I was getting inspired looking at that.

39
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,120
And then someone was like, you know what?

40
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,879
They're playing a bunch of those right now and apparently for like two weeks they're playing all of those studio Ghibli films.

41
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,180
And I'm just going to be there every day.

42
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:26,434
It's happening right now. Yeah.

43
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,786
Over the weekend I saw three: I saw Nausicaa, which is like a big inspiration for stuff that we're doing right now.

44
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:34,059
[Offscreen] Yeah we just watched that last week.

45
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:35,619
Really great, it's really great.

46
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,033
Rice: Yeah. We had like another art slot.

47
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,140
We didn't know what we were going to fill it with and like right now it makes sense

48
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,240
because concepts the most needed and that's why Levi's around.

49
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,148
But I mean, who knows?

50
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:56,406
Like later in the project we could be ramping down on concept and need more animation and have to switch it out.

51
00:04:56,406 --> 00:05:02,254
But yeah, we always had one other spot for an artist and I'm glad that it was Levi.

52
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,305
Offscreen Voice: How far along did Peter Chan get with his contributions?

53
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,960
Rice: How far did Peter get?

54
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:15,600
I think the last stuff that Peter did was some environment designs for spaceship stuff.

55
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,073
Schafer: All right. It's been good talking to you, Peter.

56
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,851
Chan: Thank you again, you guys, for everything and it was a lot of fun.

57
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,255
And to be part of it.

58
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:26,001
So thank you for inviting me.

59
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:29,201
Schafer: We'll see you again. Petty: Thanks, Peter.

60
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:30,416
Rice: Yeah, it was a bit of a bummer.

61
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:36,493
I mean, he was offsite so it wasn't like we were hanging out all the time, which would have been super fun.

62
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,400
But still, like I did look forward to every Friday, getting like a drop of art from him.

63
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:49,424
But Levi's around so like having him right next door and getting to see his stuff, which has been like a totally different take on it and you know,

64
00:05:49,424 --> 00:05:52,230
being able to hang out with him in the office has been fun.

65
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,337
Rice: Yeah. I don't know if you talked to Lee much about what you're going to start with, concept-wise.

66
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,071
Ryken: Yeah, I have concept stuff for boy world stuff.

67
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,840
Rice: Did you check out Peter's? Ryken: Yeah.

68
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,820
Rice: Yeah, are you scared?

69
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,080
It's a lot to live up to, man.

70
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,260
Ryken: I'll get out my tracing paper.

71
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,160
Rice: Yeah, I don't think it works that way.

72
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,700
Ryken: Peter Chan did a bunch of the early stuff and I've been looking at what he's been doing.

73
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:23,692
This is me, actually look at this.

74
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,980
That's bootleg P. Chan.

75
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,680
Schafer: And we have interviewed an intern, an art intern.

76
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,863
I haven't met her yet, but everyone seemed to like her and think she was good.

77
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,232
And that would help, too.

78
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,821
Offscreen Voice: Oh no, you filmed that!

79
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:43,701
Schafer: Please also join me in welcoming Marius from Germany, where did he go...

80
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:45,700
There he is! Marius Fitz...

81
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,358
I'm going to have you pronounce your last name.

82
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,887
Can you pronounce your last name for us?

83
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,880
Fietzek: Fietzek.

84
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,788
Schafer: You know, Marius was the one who made an adventure game as a job application for Double Fine, which seems very nice.

85
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:15,066
Fietzek: Hey, I heard about the Double Fine Adventure and was super-hyped and yeah, I thought like if I want to,

86
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:23,726
if there's a chance to work with my idols on the 2D animated game, then this is like the only chance maybe ever.

87
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:30,886
So I made an, application video game.

88
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,835
Schafer: Our plan is to actually release that as a Double Fine Adventure and then pocket all the Kickstarter money.

89
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,680
We'll give you a small percentage of it.

90
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,622
How long will Marius be here, Mr. Greg Rice?

91
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,900
Rice: Three months.

92
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,802
Schafer: You get three months, holy cow.

93
00:07:46,802 --> 00:07:48,486
And what will he be doing?

94
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,220
Rice: Who knows? Schafer: Who knows.

95
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,040
Rice: Animating. Schafer: You'll do some animating on Red's.

96
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:02,098
Fietzek: But I started with the whole cinematic approach on the very first cut scene, just to see how it feels.

97
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:12,078
I thought of a very quiet start where we first see the spaceship, because I don't, I don't remember a point at the space boy part

98
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,591
where we actually see the ship.

99
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,741
Schafer: Well, Marius is great.

100
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:21,385
Like he's like, he'll just show us, you know, a story board and it's really hard to like how someone do something

101
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:24,981
that's really great and really funny, but just for what you were thinking of it, maybe it's not right.

102
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,629
Schafer: And the same way the girl starts.

103
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:33,482
She's just laying on the hillside and it's not a cut scene, but like a steady state; you exit out of it by tapping.

104
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:34,657
And the same way with this.

105
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:40,285
It's really got to be that it pans over and shows him and he's laying there on the bed, and the same kind of just, you know.

106
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,161
[Schafer] So you got to like tell him, like I had to tell him like this whole sequence was backwards.

107
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:48,221
And he's like, oh great, OK, great.

108
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:50,581
And then I come back the next day and it's completely different.

109
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:53,361
Exactly the way I wanted and it's perfect and it's like, oh, that's great.

110
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:18,369
[Schafer vocalizing sound effects] Schafer: That's awesome.

111
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,990
Schafer: You know, it's like, finding someone like that is really, it's hard to find people like that and so you kind of hang onto them.

112
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,563
Of course, he's supposed to go back to school.

113
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,560
So then you have to figure out whether you want to derail someone's education by trying to recruit them to come to your company.

114
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,882
Which of course, I have no problem with.

115
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:38,322
I'm already done thinking about it and I've already thought about it while I was saying that sentence, so, so much for his education.

116
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:45,155
[Laughter] Rice: We're finally like fully staffed and we've got like our team,

117
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,867
all of our budget's totally spent on everyone who's on the team.

118
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:56,860
So I think that, you know, a month or so from now it's going to feel like everything's just kind of moving forward steadily and the game is being made.

119
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,455
Rice: At the time when we started the Maiden Feast, that was kind of the only puzzle that was far enough along

120
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,605
that we had enough of a design to actually start building stuff.

121
00:10:15,605 --> 00:10:21,460
So we did know going in that it was like a super kind of meaty puzzle that was going to be a tough one to implement.

122
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,060
And we still, you know, it was kind of all we had to go on at the point.

123
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,868
Schafer: I had the Maiden's Feast designed so they had to like, oh, we got to pick that, 'cause that's the only thing that's really designed.

124
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:35,802
Rice: But by the time we'd gotten it to like the first pass kind of state, then we had designs for this Cloud Colony stuff,

125
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:41,282
which we knew was just a lot easier to implement and a lot more indicative of the rest of the game.

126
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:49,120
Schafer: So navigation across different layers and pointing and clicking, talking to people, camera motion is all part of Cloud Colony.

127
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,770
Rice: One of the nice things about being able to make those kinds of decisions and jump around is we can like really look at in the moment

128
00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:04,160
what is most important for the game and be able to kind of like change tracks, without having to like clear that decision with a publisher.

129
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:12,405
Schafer: So we kind of left Maiden Feast where it was, which is, you know, has like a stand-in, a couple stand-in pieces of art in there.

130
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,706
Much as it pains me to leave that unfinished, but we'll revisit it soon, I think.

131
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:22,766
Schafer: This is a kick-off meeting for the Cloud Colony.

132
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,280
Required reading for this meeting is this document everyone' read, I'm sure.

133
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,719
I've already started working on it.

134
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:36,241
So I think it's just good to go over all the puzzles in case it exposes things we haven't thought of or just questions you guys have.

135
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,140
Are you ready? Ready to begin?

136
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:46,440
Schafer: This is the part of the game right after the Maiden's Feast when you get, when you break away and you hitch a ride on that buzzard, on the corset.

137
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,540
And you fly.

138
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,242
It takes you up into the air.

139
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:57,075
She's the sacrifice girl who's just chosen to run away instead of being sacrificed and feels that she may have just endangered,

140
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,441
she's been told that this will endanger her entire town if the monster's not appeased.

141
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:10,018
So now the monster's all upset and she's feeling like I have to do something to get rid of this monster and to protect my family and my town.

142
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,458
But before I get back there I'm going to have to like figure out a plan.

143
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:24,689
So she arrives in the home world, if you will, of the bird, which is a little village made of primarily nests that have been,

144
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:28,349
that are buoyant on these really thick clouds, that we're calling the Cloud Colony.

145
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:38,107
[Music] Schafer: I feel much better because I actually, like I felt good

146
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:41,867
after I wrote that cloud document, but that was really only like four puzzles.

147
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:44,667
And the spaceship one has like sixteen puzzles in there or something.

148
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:45,907
So I'm catching up now.

149
00:12:45,960 --> 00:13:09,880
[Music] Schafer: Aha! Work. I did work.

150
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,240
This is the spec for the whole spaceship.

151
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,660
Designed all the puzzles for the spaceship.

152
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,140
Offscreen Voice: Really? All the puzzles?

153
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,000
Schafer: Yeah, all the puzzles for the spaceship.

154
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,980
And this is just two-thirds of the puzzles for the girl's world.

155
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,580
But there's still, I mean, there's still a lot of stuff to design.

156
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,500
Schafer: But it's like I have plot points, you know.

157
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,407
I have things where I know I want that to end, Act One.

158
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:40,141
And then that ends Act Two.

159
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:42,250
And then I have these plot points that happen.

160
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:49,830
And then to get to that plot point you have to create obstacles and puzzles at the same time, which come out of the story.

161
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,510
Break out of routine.

162
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,304
Spaceship boy has this routine that he's stuck in every day in space and he has to break out of it.

163
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:58,304
That's the first puzzle.

164
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,269
You do work backwards.

165
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:02,803
Like you know, it's like you actually aren't designing puzzles.

166
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:05,243
You're designing the obstacles in a lot of ways.

167
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:13,101
Like you say, you had a situation in the game where character, you just know there's a plot point where they have to shoot the President.

168
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,162
And so, I don't have any plans to shoot the President.

169
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:18,422
So, but anyways, say that was a puzzle in the game.

170
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:19,961
The President's really bad.

171
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,238
You got to shoot the President.

172
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,673
You know, I work backwards, so some cool wish fulfillment, like OK, he's going to be, he's sneaking into the White House.

173
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,823
How would you sneak into White House?

174
00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:30,813
You could wear a mask that made you look like a visiting ambassador.

175
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,483
Like how do you make a plaster cast of his face to make the mask?

176
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:36,343
Then maybe it's to trick him into tripping and falling in cement.

177
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:39,102
And then at each point you think, OK, was that an actual revelation?

178
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:43,562
Like you don't want to have, it just be a series of tedious chores.

179
00:14:43,562 --> 00:14:47,663
It's got to be like oh, I have a really clear problem that I need to solve.

180
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:52,023
Like the three most obvious ways to solve it don't work.

181
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,061
And the game anticipates that and like has a great response for when you try to execute that solution.

182
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:58,912
You put a little like, aha!

183
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,745
Good try, no.

184
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:02,565
But did you think about this?

185
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:07,211
And that little nudge is like, oh, you know, kind of, like doesn't give you the answer

186
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,900
but kind of points you back towards the ballpark where the answer is.

187
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,681
Schafer: This is the first puzzle.

188
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:16,401
So the puzzle is that you open this a little bit.

189
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,176
And then you try to go to it, it closes.

190
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:28,269
And then there's some really counterintuitive, almost opposite of normal way of thinking that makes you realize, ah!

191
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,714
If I did this really weird thing, that would actually work.

192
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,140
The thing you had to do with the lock is take the lock and actually lock the gate shut.

193
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,380
So now when you try to pull the chain, it can't pull the gate up and instead...

194
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,546
'Cause then the player's like, oh, I'm so smart, you know.

195
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:03,566
I figured it out.

196
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,400
Now that a lot of stuff is designed ahead of those guys and they're able to look at it and work on it.

197
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,267
That always relieves a little bit of tension.

198
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,524
Rice: Tim has filled in, it looks like boy world and I think he's even put more girl world stuff in.

199
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,104
Have you even looked at this, really, Levi?

200
00:16:24,104 --> 00:16:25,552
Ryken: This is all Tim does?

201
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,586
I thought he was supposed to be writing things, not just writing little things on Post-its.

202
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:29,926
Rice: Yeah, he's writing the whole game on little Post-its.

203
00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:30,926
Ryken: Oh, OK.

204
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,100
Rice: There wasn't much there before, so it's nice to see that it's filled out.

205
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,908
Rice: It's definitely unique and different than anything he's designed or written before.

206
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,260
So I think it's cool to see that he's trying something different and kind of going out on a limb a little bit.

207
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,685
I haven't seen any writing yet, so I don't know what that's going to be like.

208
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:52,121
Because it does seem like this game has a much more serious tone than his other games have,

209
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,464
but I'm excited to get to that point where I start seeing Tim's writing, because I'm sure it'll be awesome.

210
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,420
Rice: So far this is in the game.

211
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,060
This is all in the game.

212
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,919
It looks like this.

213
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,460
This is all in the game.

214
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,800
And now we're going to be starting on some of this stuff.

215
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,719
Rice: And we have an approved girl, so that's exciting.

216
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,284
Petty: So let's see.

217
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,439
So let's look at the suicide girl. So she's got...

218
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,922
Schafer: See, you call her suicide girl, too.

219
00:17:17,922 --> 00:17:19,462
Petty: Yeah. Schafer: It's sacrifice girl.

220
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:20,402
Petty: I know it is.

221
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,120
So which of these dresses do you like the most?

222
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,113
Schafer: My favorite one is that one, but I like the original one.

223
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,707
I like that one, too.

224
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:34,087
Schafer: So I just put them in front of my daughter and let her pick.

225
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,860
That solved the whole problem.

226
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,202
Schafer: These are the princesses from papa's new game.

227
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:40,202
Schafer: I call them princesses.

228
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:41,322
Which one do you like best?

229
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,800
Think really hard.

230
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,620
Why do you like em?

231
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,060
Daughter: Because she's so beautiful.

232
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,751
Rice: And she's looking good.

233
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,720
We just got her in the game.

234
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,820
She's walking around and everything.

235
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,441
The boy's getting there.

236
00:18:03,441 --> 00:18:05,261
We've done like two rounds on him.

237
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,660
Schafer: Scott's been working on characters in the morning.

238
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:14,024
He's been kind of splitting his time with a book that he's working on, an art show or one of the zillion things that he does.

239
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:15,410
He's very busy.

240
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:22,431
Campbell: So it's an ongoing kind of, kind of project and this is the culmination of it.

241
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,496
Culmination of like a year, you know, like a year and a half's worth right now.

242
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,060
And then we have a book coming out, so that's what we're doing, so.

243
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,243
Schafer: He's drawn some of the sacrifice girl and spaceship boy.

244
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:35,658
He's been drawing some of the Cloud Colony people.

245
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,254
And I'm supposed to look at those, right.

246
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,760
I've got to give him feedback on those.

247
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,036
Schafer: I do like that guy, too.

248
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,940
But then again he is doing a cool pose.

249
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,843
Campbell: And it's going great, man.

250
00:18:44,843 --> 00:18:45,947
It's looking really good.

251
00:18:45,947 --> 00:18:51,547
I definitely feel that like relaxation of like knowing that like these designs, even if they're a little unfinished,

252
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:56,280
I know they're going to go to Bagel and he's going to make them like, fucking make 'em Bagel-style.

253
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,860
Dude, I just swore again.

254
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,080
I mean, I thought for sure I wasn't going to swear in these things.

255
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,888
I'm mellowing out, dude.

256
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:04,125
But yeah, he's doing great.

257
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,745
He has a lot of work ahead of him, though.

258
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:09,280
He's stressed about it, but Bagel's the kind of guy, he's like just this kind of chill dude, you know.

259
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,868
He's like, I know.

260
00:19:10,868 --> 00:19:14,676
He's like, I'm going to, he's like, I'm going to have a lot of work ahead of me, but ah.

261
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,316
'Cause it's like it's all fun stuff, you know, he's doing what he loves, which is like painting that stuff, you know.

262
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:27,408
And he's definitely, he's definitely feeling kind of nervous, but I'm so excited for it to be his, his look, so yeah.

263
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,617
Offscreen Voice: So Bagel's in the studio this week? Rice: Yeah.

264
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,860
Bagel's in my house this week. Offscreen Voice: Perfect.

265
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,108
Rice: He had to take Marius's spot from the couch.

266
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:50,728
So Marius got kicked out.

267
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,460
I'm like running a hostel right now.

268
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,080
Stapley: Yeah, it's weird.

269
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,860
There's a lot of farting going on.

270
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,980
He has these weird nerdy glasses that he wears at night.

271
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,200
Schafer: Why is Bagel in the office this week?

272
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,420
I don't know.

273
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,640
Hi guys.

274
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,900
Schafer: Hi, oh my god you look so real.

275
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,360
Lee: He's come out of the camera!

276
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,140
Schafer: The microphone is working so well today.

277
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,800
Bagel: My microphone is awesome!

278
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,520
Crook: Now we can't turn you down.

279
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:24,785
Schafer: Lee was starting some new processes with art production, like trying to get Bagel to be pretty independent

280
00:20:24,785 --> 00:20:27,844
where he could just paint actual art for the game right into the engines.

281
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:33,386
So getting that set up was really hard to do over Skype or Google Hang Outs, like we do.

282
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,280
We don't always have the smoothest conversations over that, I don't know if you noticed.

283
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,192
Stapley: [inaudible] Petty: I think we're going to do it tomorrow.

284
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,358
Stapley: [inaudible] Petty: What's that?

285
00:20:45,462 --> 00:20:48,900
Stapley: [inaudible] Petty: I'm sorry, I can't make it out, dude.

286
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,180
Stapley: [inaudible] [Laughing]

287
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,724
Stapley: But it is good to kind of sit right with them, you know.

288
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:06,243
Crook: Yeah, I think this texture, the painting style goes really well with this sort of weird... Stapley: Brush stroke.

289
00:21:06,243 --> 00:21:07,274
Crook: the way we're animating it.

290
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,660
I think it goes really well with it.

291
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,133
I think it's cool.

292
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,142
Stapley: But yeah, there are some things that are easier just to talk to, like walk over to Lee and talk to him, I think.

293
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:18,393
I've already done that like three times today, which is pretty nice.

294
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,313
Rice: And here like with such a small art team, like it's going to be really important that he's not only painting stuff

295
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:29,240
but like making sure it gets into the game right and looks good and he's viewing it in the game and seeing how that changes.

296
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,700
Petty: So like Brandon spent a lot of time making sure that all the tools he was writing

297
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,320
were going to help Bagel and make sure that that was a really smooth process.

298
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:46,610
Brandon: The main thing that I've been working is enhancements to our scene editor so that the tool works a little bit more like Photoshop

299
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,603
in terms of being able to hide and show the layers that you're working on.

300
00:21:49,603 --> 00:21:54,622
I got the Nav meshes in there so that instead of just editing these in text files you can actually,

301
00:21:54,622 --> 00:21:59,422
you know, individually kind of lay out the geometry for the walkable areas.

302
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,883
Just really trying to flesh the stuff out so that the workflow for artists is a lot smoother.

303
00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:10,064
Rice: And it's almost there so I think that's the, that's the idea, is to try to get him comfortable with that process.

304
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,980
Stapley: Yeah, so you can see...

305
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:19,824
Right. Right, right.

306
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,660
Still totally getting used to this shit.

307
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:52,350
[Music] Stapley: Hey, bros. What's up?

308
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,050
How's it going, fellows?

309
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,840
Offscreen Voice: So, has this been coming along?

310
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,482
Stapley: Oh, it's almost done, it's almost done.

311
00:22:58,667 --> 00:22:59,827
No, I'm just kidding.

312
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,538
It's not done at all.

313
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,700
I'm going to give up on it and come back to it later.

314
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:11,188
And there's a bunch of other shit to do and I like don't have any fresh eyes on it anymore, you know.

315
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,860
I've just been looking at the same thing for like a week and I'm over it.

316
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,140
I'm going to just work on it until stand-ups and then Tim's going to check it out.

317
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,380
Petty: In terms of like how good the readability is.

318
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:28,278
If it's feeling right to you, you know, story, theme-wise and all that, before he digs into some of the other areas.

319
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,404
And then you know, like there's a lot of, like because that Cloud Colony...

320
00:23:31,404 --> 00:23:34,660
Schafer: I can see how the world's going to look pretty and how it's going to all look like it's one cohesive thing,

321
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:44,688
but the secret thing that I'm hoping for is still, we have some of the, Bagel's ideas that only he would come up with for the landscape.

322
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,620
Kind of bizarre.

323
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,700
He doesn't have those in there yet.

324
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,860
Stapley: Yeah, this was Peter's, Peter's concept ideas.

325
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,105
Lee's layout.

326
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,341
Would I do a painting of this?

327
00:23:57,341 --> 00:23:58,201
I'm not sure.

328
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,260
I don't know if I would.

329
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,740
But like I'm doing a painting of it now.

330
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,880
OK, man.

331
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,918
I'm wondering about that Bagel filter thing.

332
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,140
I'm just wondering what it is, you know.

333
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,260
What if Tim's happy with it.

334
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,280
I should talk to Tim.

335
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,520
Schafer: I have not talked to him about that.

336
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,000
I haven't talked to him on this trip about how he's feeling about everything.

337
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,440
That'll be interesting.

338
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,438
Hopefully we get some alone time.

339
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,780
Petty: I just don't know about the painting Bagel.

340
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,600
Now how are you feeling about the like...

341
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,300
We've been going back and forth a long time just trying to get a feel for that whole process.

342
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,137
Stapley: The paining process? Petty: Yeah.

343
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,904
And then like work on this big ass fucking layered files and...

344
00:24:37,904 --> 00:24:40,029
Stapley: Yeah, yeah. I'm comfortable with that.

345
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:43,840
I'd like to actually get involved more with like the concept stuff, though.

346
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,420
Petty: Yeah?

347
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,842
Stapley: I feel like I'm just kind of a painter.

348
00:24:46,842 --> 00:24:52,988
I just feel like people are expecting it to be mine somehow, you know, just 'cause, you know.

349
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,820
That's what people are saying.

350
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,659
And like it's supposed to be my style but it isn't really.

351
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,790
Petty: It may be that you're feeling like the painting isn't the side that you care about most.

352
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:07,167
Maybe you feel more about the shape, language and the concept design and we, you know, Levi does painting and you do layouts.

353
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:09,467
There's flexibility there.

354
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,502
Stapley: Where like I don't paint everything but be kind of like overlook, you know.

355
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,820
Kind of just try to keep everything together.

356
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,180
And that way I'm able to do some more idea stuff.

357
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,739
'Cause even now the way it's going, like I don't think, I mean, like even this way

358
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,211
I don't think I'd be able to do all these paintings in four months.

359
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,580
Seventy paintings by myself, anyway, you know.

360
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:43,592
Well, at least if we're going to say like this is Bagel's style game, then I would, yeah, at least I would have a little bit more like yeah,

361
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,579
you know, that is my stuff. You know.

362
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,860
Instead of like, ah, it's like an awesome Peter Chan drawing or something, you know, that I colored.

363
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,178
Why don't we like finish off this sprint until the end of the month, right.

364
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,665
I'll try to get all this cloud things going.

365
00:26:00,665 --> 00:26:05,776
Petty: But I think it's a tougher thing where that if we come up with a sketch of a plan that we think might work,

366
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,782
then I think we should try it sooner than later, 'cause fuck a sprint.

367
00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:10,066
Who cares? I don't care.

368
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:11,666
There's no publisher fucking us in the ass over it.

369
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:17,029
Like with just the whole point is, it's just there to like be milestones as we make this game, right?

370
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:23,404
So if we, you know, as long we're meeting Tim's goals for the project, as long as we think we can actually get it done

371
00:26:23,404 --> 00:26:29,104
and as long as we're all willing to give it a shot, there's no reason in the world we shouldn't be flexible. Right.

372
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,960
Stapley: I think it was because really when it first started, it was going to be like $300,000

373
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,680
and we're going to just try to do some retro Day of the Tentacle shit, you know.

374
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,020
And I know things change so much from the beginning of this Kickstarter thing, you know.

375
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,187
And I know now it's huge, it's a big thing, which is great.

376
00:26:49,187 --> 00:26:50,785
And it's awesome.

377
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,260
But, I think we can work it out somehow.

378
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,244
Schafer: You know, right now Bagel's been doing a lot of painting, which is not necessarily, I can see where that would feel like,

379
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:05,079
you're just like doing a coloring book or paint-by-numbers.

380
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,780
Those are just my terms, not his.

381
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,837
Stapley: I don't know.

382
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,940
I don't even know how it's going to turn out.

383
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,740
It might turn out totally different.

384
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,960
I'm just kind of glad I got it off my chest, that's all.

385
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,820
Schafer: Yeah, I think his coming out here in person is what allowed him to open up about that.

386
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,832
I think he's over Skype.

387
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,220
It's hard to really talk about, how you're feeling.

388
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,420
Stapley: I'm glad I said it, because I was all worried about it.

389
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,308
So I think so.

390
00:27:34,308 --> 00:27:36,868
I think we're going to try to start doing that.

391
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,924
Schafer: Like I'll feel a lot better once we made one of something.

392
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:46,552
Like once, 'cause I was feeling like we had not yet accomplished, the game was looking good and coming along, right.

393
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:53,911
But we'd not yet accomplished that thing of seeing something in the playable version of the game that had that crazy Bagel-style yet.

394
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:59,840
Like the special element of like surrealism or just kind of dream logic that his paintings might have.

395
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,940
I hadn't yet seen in the game yet.

396
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,581
So once we have something like that in the game, I'll be like, OK, great.

397
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,900
We just need to do that a whole bunch of times then I'll feel a lot more relaxed.

398
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,180
But until you achieve that, there's always this question of like will you be able to achieve what you want to do.

399
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:19,039
You know, it's tricky, 'cause you got to make, get the game to look the way you want it to look,

400
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,480
but also get done on time with the people that you have and also all those people have to be happy.

401
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,478
Yeah, like you're trying to get people to contribute their whole selfs to the project.

402
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,020
So that's challenging.

403
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:36,306
But it's what I spent the most of my time recently, like the last ten years recently, like doing, like trying to solve that problem.

404
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:44,771
How to make a group of people work well together and bring the best ideas forth and make good stuff together.

405
00:28:44,969 --> 00:29:28,189
