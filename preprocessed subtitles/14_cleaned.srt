1
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:27,187
Offscreen Voice: Tomorrow, how's it going to play out?

2
00:00:27,187 --> 00:00:35,221
Schafer: We're going to, let's see, tomorrow, come in here, push the button, there's a big plastic button in the middle of the room.

3
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:38,567
We all push it at the same time, put our hands in and then push it.

4
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:39,726
We totally should have that.

5
00:00:39,726 --> 00:00:47,019
That'd be much more dramatic than like Greg sitting at his desk and Chris and then they tap and then they're like, OK.

6
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:48,299
It's off.

7
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:52,865
But that's the way it's going to go.

8
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:22,000
[Music] Gardner: There's so much animation that needs to be polished.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,469
Crook: Well, well, there's a lot that's, that's done, but it's just not in.

10
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:27,666
Somewhat slow going.

11
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:32,212
Schafer: OK. Does anyone want to say anything about the schedule?

12
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:34,232
Like how easy it looks?

13
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,565
Rice: But yeah, there's a lot to do in two months left.

14
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:40,682
Schafer: Where's the warmest spot in this, in this office?

15
00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:42,329
Crook: Just snuggle up to me.

16
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,014
Crook: This sweater and, Schafer: Oh, wow.

17
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:46,654
He's so warm in there.

18
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:48,806
Look at you, you look like a longshoreman.

19
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:50,091
Crook: I was so cold yesterday.

20
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:52,181
Schafer: You're like a lumberjack, like a lumberjack by the sea.

21
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:54,936
I just need to be by Anna's heater.

22
00:01:54,936 --> 00:01:58,357
Schafer: Hey, is this thing even on?

23
00:01:58,357 --> 00:02:00,420
Kipnis: You want it on? Here.

24
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,300
Schafer: Gather 'round the fire, everybody.

25
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,359
Rice: We each should have a little fire.

26
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,276
Schafer: Hello. Is everyone here?

27
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:08,695
We'll have him, quick. OK, anyways.

28
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,473
Hey, everybody. What are you doing?

29
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:11,655
Mr. Petty, what have you been working on?

30
00:02:11,655 --> 00:02:14,950
Petty: What we're doing up until, for the next couple weeks is getting all the new content

31
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,149
and, which I think in art, there's very little new content.

32
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:20,571
It's mainly us repainting and polishing and refining.

33
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:22,951
Ryken: Yeah, we're coming down to the wire but it's going good.

34
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,740
I'm working on little fix-y things.

35
00:02:25,743 --> 00:02:29,543
Things that were painted really crappily and are now, I'm in the time to polish up.

36
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,590
Schafer: Bagel's right here.

37
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,496
Ryken: Yes, yes.

38
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,774
I'm fixing, Petty: You better be referring to other work.

39
00:02:32,774 --> 00:02:35,574
Ryken: I'm fixing the things that Bagel's "fixing", right now.

40
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:41,390
Ryken: We're just getting down to the point where, [Offscreen Voice]

41
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,070
Ryken: What?

42
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,260
Ryken: Oh, look at that! That's crazy.

43
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,571
Didn't I just do that. Petty: Yeah.

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,719
Ryken: He's so fast, man.

45
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,131
You have the rim light working on him?

46
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,040
Man, maybe I'm just slow.

47
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:58,815
Petty: In some cases we're repeating characters, because now that we see like the range of what they did,

48
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:01,954
like we repainted a Mog Chothra, Levi did for like the third time.

49
00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:05,929
And part of that is because his presence in the game was much bigger than when we originally painted him.

50
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:10,099
And the type of stuff he needs to do for like the boss battle or for these other areas

51
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:14,510
is a greater range of movement and a lot more close-ups and has various mouth states.

52
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:21,907
So the best thing to do is like sometimes you can keep patching asset, but sometimes it's best to just go, wipe that clean.

53
00:03:21,907 --> 00:03:24,254
And we know exactly how it's going to be used now, just repaint it.

54
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:25,755
So that's pretty much what we did.

55
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:28,520
And it'll pay off, because he has a lot of screen time.

56
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,098
Ryken: Yeah, we're not as pressed as the animators.

57
00:03:31,098 --> 00:03:39,174
We kind of just listen to them, working their ass off over there while we kind of just pretty things up.

58
00:03:39,174 --> 00:03:43,170
Gardner: Today I'm trying to get this scene in, 'cause it's such a big one.

59
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,317
It's going to be a series of like four different cut scenes that we put together in the game.

60
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:51,080
And like none of those are in the game right now, and that's like, really close to shipping.

61
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,419
So it's like this last, bit of time.

62
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:58,020
Just like every other department, we're all kinda just like rushing through everything.

63
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:07,537
Choy: The animation, like overall, like animation just has more work, but a lot of times my time is compressed into like the last,

64
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:14,517
like couple of weeks that I can do work, because I come after everyone else and like I guess, right before audio.

65
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:18,822
Stoddard: I'm finishing all the sound in two weeks. Schafer: Yay!

66
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:28,777
Stoddard: I'm going, I'm basically following the animators as closely as possible, because I'm trying to jump on all the cut scenes as they come in and like do them.

67
00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:30,497
Schafer: Ray's like, good luck, 'cause we're so fast.

68
00:04:31,475 --> 00:04:36,524
Stoddard: I'm trying to save January 6 through 10 to mix the game.

69
00:04:36,524 --> 00:04:42,064
I'd really, really like to have that time to do that, so I'm trying to get in as much as possible in the next two weeks.

70
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:48,683
Choy: Kind even Camden and I had a lunch where we were kind of talking about like, OK, well, we're here at this stage now

71
00:04:48,683 --> 00:04:50,486
where everything's supposed to be wrapping up.

72
00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:51,822
Like what do we do?

73
00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:54,372
Like what's the social fix for it?

74
00:04:54,372 --> 00:04:58,506
And like part of me's like, oh, you know, like I'm just going to be really like irritable all the time

75
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,065
and just like be really hard, kind of hard to like work with.

76
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:06,420
So like if people want to make changes they'll be like, oh my God, did I piss her off even more?

77
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,995
So like this, like some of that, like there's like you kind of have to be a little bit of a wall,

78
00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:17,063
otherwise like, just so people, not necessarily to like stop changes, but just so people will like kind of think twice

79
00:05:17,063 --> 00:05:21,310
or like maybe think smarter when they want to polish something.

80
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,570
Schafer: So it's a little tight.

81
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,895
This means more late night food for free for Ray.

82
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:33,184
See, so it's really saving Ray money, 'cause he's going to stay late to animate all this stuff.

83
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:41,911
Rice: And this is just a bunch of rice.

84
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:44,691
Crook: You see, this is the size.

85
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,861
Schafer: I've been doing a lot of press stuff.

86
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:49,961
We went down and showed the game at the VGX Awards.

87
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:50,998
Did you guys watch?

88
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:52,195
It was fun.

89
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:53,625
I got a lot of love on Twitter from that.

90
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:58,877
And a lot of people who hadn't heard of the game before were just crazy, because I always assume the entire world knows all about the game.

91
00:05:58,877 --> 00:06:00,418
But I got this like, what is this game?

92
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:02,158
This looks kind of cool, this is awesome.

93
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:08,847
Keighley: This is really exciting, 'cause this is a guy I've loved for so long and we now have him live on the VGX stage.

94
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:10,974
Not you, Joel, but Tim Schafer is with us!

95
00:06:10,974 --> 00:06:12,243
Tim Schafer!

96
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:15,647
Tim is of course the creative genius behind Brutal Legend, Psychonauts and Grim Fandango

97
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:21,388
and his latest is the Kickstarter funded adventure game, Broken Age, which raised over three million dollars.

98
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:22,639
McHale: Three and a half million, Geoff.

99
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,740
Schafer: Thank you.

100
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,939
Schafer: He's funny. He's nice.

101
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:26,629
He was nice to me off camera.

102
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:28,149
He was like, hey, get ready for this.

103
00:06:29,243 --> 00:06:31,943
I'm going to ask you if you were high when you designed this game.

104
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:35,255
McHale: @Brandon Victoran asks, hey, Tim.

105
00:06:35,255 --> 00:06:37,597
What was the inspiration for the project?

106
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,637
Schafer: Well, McHale: Did you get high or something?

107
00:06:41,646 --> 00:06:44,606
Schafer: Uh, no, no. McHale: Sorry.

108
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:48,086
Remo: It's been getting really tangible, how excited people are to play it.

109
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:51,280
Like it's been very visible and you can really, you can really feel it.

110
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,545
So it's very, very exciting, like we have a big list of stuff to do to get the game out.

111
00:06:56,545 --> 00:07:01,838
You know, Greg is obviously driving that stuff so it's going to be pretty crazy few weeks,

112
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:06,132
but I think our community is going to be incredibly enthusiastic.

113
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:08,157
Is going to, and really help us get the word out.

114
00:07:08,157 --> 00:07:10,757
So it's really good times.

115
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:14,446
Rice: I think that there's going to be a lot of excitement.

116
00:07:14,446 --> 00:07:19,831
Like I think we've been doing some bigger things, like VGX and stuff that's been building up, you know, hype.

117
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:25,096
And I think that ultimately the people who are going to care the most about the game are the 90,000 that already bought it

118
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:26,746
and they're going to be super-stoked playing it.

119
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:31,075
So I feel like there's going to be a huge ripple effect from them, of them just sharing their excitement.

120
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:35,754
I think that that'll just be something that we should try and capitalize on as much as possible.

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,700
Bailey: the big splash, so you're thinking?

122
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,258
Rice: Yeah, well, I just think that yeah, they've been waiting 15 years for this game.

123
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:47,098
Bailey: There is the counterpoint, just so you know, which is that, that all the adventure fans are really interested in this

124
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:49,603
and it's a very small market and that's why most publishers got out of it.

125
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,746
Rice: Yeah, I know.

126
00:07:50,746 --> 00:07:53,085
Bailey: So those fans have basically already backed the game.

127
00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:54,405
Rice: Yeah. But that's what we're going to prove wrong, right?

128
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,800
Bailey: You're going to prove that wrong, OK.

129
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,989
Rice: Everyone is a skeptic.

130
00:07:56,989 --> 00:07:58,324
Bailey: But it still could, it can be somewhere between it, right?

131
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,149
Where is the genre, is say, you know, 500,000 people.

132
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,604
Rice: Yeah, I think that that's where the quality of the game is going to be, ultimately makes a call.

133
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:12,850
Like I think if it comes out and reviews really well and people have a really great experience and are talking about it,

134
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,846
I think the game will be able to kind of live on through really solid sales.

135
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:21,784
You know, if it has kind of average scores, then it probably will be a different story.

136
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:25,631
Schafer: Broken Age is a welcome return to the graphic adventure games by Tim Schafer.

137
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,671
See, I can't read this, it's got my name in it.

138
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:35,910
Schafer: We hired some old friends of ours who are game reviewers in the previous life

139
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:41,479
and asked them to write a review of Broken Age as if they were actually, just got a copy and were reviewing it.

140
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,783
To know, you know, is there some big thing we have overlooked or what, what might a review look like for the game.

141
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:52,183
And they came back really good.

142
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:58,046
Positives: intuitive point and click interface, good balance between exploration, character interaction and puzzle solving.

143
00:08:58,046 --> 00:09:01,561
Game recognizes when players are stuck and provides clues without giving them answers.

144
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:05,361
Negatives: I missed the inventory command and the opening with Shay and the spoon.

145
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:10,409
Phfft. In the gaming industry mock reviews are a common thing.

146
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:12,843
We have never done our own, so that's the good thing.

147
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:17,267
It's like a part of what we're trying to do is being a real self-publisher.

148
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:21,473
You know, being your own publisher is taking care of these things, which are like mock reviews,

149
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:24,753
'cause they affect how much or how you plan your launch, you know.

150
00:09:25,752 --> 00:09:30,273
Like you would plan, if we got really like, if the mock reviews were like, ah, it's kind of rough,

151
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:32,633
but they'll probably have it sorted out by the time they launch Act Two.

152
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:38,120
We might think that wouldn't, we'd be inclined to put it in the early, early access section of Steam, you know.

153
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,529
But if it came back, oh, it's super-polished and it's great.

154
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:46,448
It's like a first episode of something, and that means it really should be in the other section of the Steam, with regular games.

155
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,241
Schafer: No.

156
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:59,720
I mean, Microsoft did play tests for Psychonauts and people were like, it got like fun-ativity ratings or whatever.

157
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,470
And oh God.

158
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,006
Is that what this is?

159
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:07,366
Schafer: Here's the marketing document that Microsoft made for Psychonauts.

160
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,946
Based on the twelve focus groups conducted worldwide, the primary weakness of the game are the story line,

161
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,526
which is considered unoriginal, childish and overly complex.

162
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:22,784
Tongue-in-cheek nature of the game is a weakness, most simply did not get the joke.

163
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:24,730
Others disliked the satirical humor.

164
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,784
In addition, many feel the humor would get old limiting replayability.

165
00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:33,050
Humor should be incorporated into the game as a secondary or supporting characteristic.

166
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,930
Humor should be simplified and made immediately apparent.

167
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:41,157
[Laughter] To help international appeal, limit game components

168
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:44,357
that feel especially Americanized, i.e. summer camp.

169
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,658
Thank you, marketing research.

170
00:10:48,658 --> 00:10:51,818
Yeah. Limit, so you can obviously take this stuff too far.

171
00:10:52,957 --> 00:10:54,207
I mean, good God.

172
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:57,407
Thank God we got cancelled. Anyway.

173
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,785
That's not what we're doing this time.

174
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:05,045
This time we just sent it to three reviewers that we knew and asked them to write reviews, just as if they're writing actual reviews.

175
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:06,745
As mean as you would have been.

176
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:14,286
If you've ever loved the Tim Schafer game, if you've ever loved whimsy, you will love this game.

177
00:11:14,286 --> 00:11:20,384
I'm glad to see the return of the genre and the return of a legend.

178
00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:22,011
See why I can't read these?

179
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:23,538
That's just embarrassing.

180
00:11:23,538 --> 00:11:24,487
But it's good.

181
00:11:24,487 --> 00:11:30,857
Yeah, there's no like, like it was always problematic near the end of Brutal to hear the recurring stuff about the RTS stuff,

182
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,678
'cause that's really hard, like what are we going to do?

183
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:35,842
What the crap, what are we going to do?

184
00:11:35,842 --> 00:11:38,284
And EA was like, we're just going to, it's good.

185
00:11:38,284 --> 00:11:39,664
We're going to ship it how it is.

186
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:42,520
But here there's nothing about the quality of game.

187
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:50,673
It's more about, we have to hit the pricing right and we have to make sure the puzzles are hard enough, especially in the second act.

188
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:57,200
As pricing will directly affect the overall Metacritic score breakdown of price to Metacritic score has been included, see page 8.

189
00:11:58,455 --> 00:12:00,995
For the purpose of this summary will assume a $15 to $20 price point.

190
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,580
Oh, I don't think that's what Justin's assuming.

191
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:08,330
He thinks if we charge $15, we'll get 80-85 Metacritic.

192
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,604
If we charge $20, we'll get 79 to 80 percent Metacritic.

193
00:12:11,604 --> 00:12:15,344
Charge $25 to $30, we'll go to 70 to 60 percent of Metacritic.

194
00:12:15,722 --> 00:12:17,022
Interesting.

195
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:25,461
Schafer: That's just him saying, I mean reviewers, I guess, take into account how much a game costs when they give it a score.

196
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:30,039
So it costs $60, you know, like geometry wars.

197
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:35,214
If that cost $60, you might give it a lower score than if it cost $15.

198
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,412
Schafer: We don't know yet.

199
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,409
That's the whole discussion.

200
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:41,306
Bailey: I know it's happening.

201
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:46,221
I just kind of disagree that that reviewer should take in, price into consideration when making this review.

202
00:12:46,221 --> 00:12:48,158
Rice: Yeah, well, especially now since price fluctuates so much.

203
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:52,207
In the sense things go on sale so often and prices change and go down.

204
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:53,843
Yeah, that's a tricky one.

205
00:12:53,843 --> 00:13:02,223
Bailey: And so I saw, when I, I did my research so like it showed that indie games can be anywhere from like $2.99 to about $29.99,

206
00:13:02,223 --> 00:13:04,663
as like the acceptable pricing.

207
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:06,624
There was one for $34.99...

208
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:08,064
Rice: What was that?

209
00:13:08,064 --> 00:13:12,191
Bailey: Well, it was the Monkey Island one that came out, that Telltale did.

210
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,903
Rice: Of the Telltale, Tales of Monkey Island, yeah.

211
00:13:13,903 --> 00:13:15,709
Bailey: But I'm going to treat that as an outlier.

212
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,466
It'll be like, OK.

213
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:23,907
The idea would be on release you would pay $24.99 and then you get both acts, Act One and Act Two.

214
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:34,173
Bailey: It is a small genre and those games used to sell, like the Grim Fandangos and you know, Full Throttles and stuff, used to sell like 500,000 copies.

215
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:36,783
You know, there were the hundreds of thousands where there were.

216
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:44,141
And you know, that's one of the reasons why if you can't sell, you know, millions upon millions now, you know, games are considered failures.

217
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:49,079
The good thing about us, is since we're publishing ourselves, you know, and it's digital distribution

218
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,622
and we can handle almost all aspects of the publishing.

219
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,875
And so for us it actually doesn't have to make a huge amount of money.

220
00:13:54,875 --> 00:14:00,394
And 500,000 copies, if it sells 500,000 copies, we'll be enormously successful as a studio.

221
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:05,199
That will supply like all the funds we need to be completely independent.

222
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,249
Rice: Anyway, this is exciting.

223
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:08,017
So, cool, man.

224
00:14:08,017 --> 00:14:10,087
Rice: Yeah, it's coming.

225
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:13,307
It's actually nice, 'cause when these decisions are made and you're just like committed to them,

226
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:16,738
then you just kind of sit back and I don't know, watch things happen.

227
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:17,598
Bailey: Yeah, can you imagine?

228
00:14:17,598 --> 00:14:23,270
What would it be like if we sold like, if we sold like blockbuster numbers for a publisher?

229
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,650
God, it'd be crazy.

230
00:14:25,423 --> 00:14:27,663
Yeah. Don't know.

231
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:38,398
Bailey: No, I, it's, you know, basically it's the studio's dream, which is to continue to operate independently.

232
00:14:38,398 --> 00:14:45,286
Bailey: But like this is, the awesome time, the awesome thing about this timeframe is that there's not a lot being featured on Steam.

233
00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:51,624
So we could potentially, best case scenario, like Max Paine, I think got, they got a month of a feature, basically.

234
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:57,384
If we could get that from the 28th all the way through February, that would be amazing.

235
00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:05,533
Bailey: Are you OK with that, rather than, I mean, 'cause I would love five dollars more and everything,

236
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:08,297
but I didn't want like, I just don't want the game to be, Schafer: No.

237
00:15:08,297 --> 00:15:16,609
I mean, I feel like you guys have talked it through enough and I was nervous about it coming out at $30 and the mock reviews wanted it to be $20,

238
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:19,716
so I think, Offscreen Voice: Split the difference.

239
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:22,316
Schafer: Is this a bad time to propose not splitting the game?

240
00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:27,413
Considered that lately? Wouldn't have to think about any of this stuff for a while.

241
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:31,289
No, I'm excited about shipping.

242
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:32,502
I'm excited about it.

243
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:40,013
Bailey: I think this is actually going to probably be, I think it will result in a better showing than if you had kept it all together.

244
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:41,978
Schafer: I think it definitely got more people talking about the game.

245
00:15:41,978 --> 00:15:43,538
Bailey: Yes.

246
00:15:43,538 --> 00:15:47,632
But it's like, the more opportunities you actually have to sell, actually potentially better.

247
00:15:47,632 --> 00:15:49,132
Schafer: Sell each puzzle.

248
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,700
I don't like this puzzle; I'd like to return this puzzle.

249
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:56,838
Bailey: Micro transactions to adventure games. Schafer: OK.

250
00:15:56,838 --> 00:16:02,916
Bailey: You know you have the fun start, about the build lockdown and timelines for all the stuff that needs to get done.

251
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:07,208
So when is the build, like when are we done touching it?

252
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:08,636
Rice: Yeah. I don't know.

253
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:13,006
That's a question that I would like to involve other people in, like Oliver.

254
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:16,355
Offscreen Voice: So you know, what is happening at this point?

255
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:18,507
Franzke: A lot, a lot is happening.

256
00:16:18,507 --> 00:16:28,585
Yeah, we kind of just switched into, I guess what's often called finaling mode where it's a lot of, I'm basically going away from working on tasks

257
00:16:28,585 --> 00:16:31,724
and more towards fixing issues in the game.

258
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,444
Just so that we can maybe get a stable version that can be released eventually.

259
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,251
Romero: That's a crash.

260
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:47,494
Yeah, you can press "space" to skip the cut scenes.

261
00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:51,682
So in this particular case, for some, you just skip the cut scene and crash.

262
00:16:51,682 --> 00:16:56,921
Yeah, we've skipped that cut scene, I want to say thousands of times, you know, collectively.

263
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:59,701
And now it decides to crash for some reason.

264
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,422
That's really how most bugs are found.

265
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:04,888
You're not trying to do something, it happens.

266
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:09,810
What I've learned is that the nature of the adventure game is that it's, everything is very handcrafted, right?

267
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,946
You want to control every step of the way because it's all story driven.

268
00:17:12,946 --> 00:17:19,520
And because of that, you have so many little points where it just, there's a bad graphic or the audio's off

269
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,246
or characters look weird doing a particular action.

270
00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:28,935
And because they want a very specific type of sort of experience, like to look a certain way and sound a certain way,

271
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:32,951
you just end up with a lot of little bugs in between all the big functional stuff.

272
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:36,380
So functionally, I mean, it's not too complex, you know, point and click.

273
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,689
I'd say our save load system is probably the most complicated because save load's always complicated anyway.

274
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:43,496
And at this point it's just polish.

275
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:47,238
Little graphics things, animation, there's a lot of missing audio, stuff like that.

276
00:17:47,238 --> 00:17:49,302
So this is the Broken Age database.

277
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:51,960
This is the list of all bugs.

278
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,205
This particular issue is going to be for Oliver, which means it's a system bug.

279
00:17:57,205 --> 00:17:58,516
And that's it.

280
00:17:58,516 --> 00:18:03,694
Once you have all the detail, the title, the steps, any attachments, if you need them.

281
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:04,908
In this case we don't.

282
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:07,579
Submit the bug and off it goes.

283
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:15,299
Franzke: The QA team is very, very good at like describing exactly how they got to this and they even say sometimes oh, this doesn't happen all the time.

284
00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:23,168
So there's a problem in this particular scene where the characters occasionally will kind of, you see the jitter?

285
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:26,112
See, see how this kind of like jitters? So OK.

286
00:18:26,112 --> 00:18:30,719
So at first, the first thing I do, I will actually look at the scene and you know, try to see the problem like this.

287
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:33,224
Like oh yeah, obviously that's something going on.

288
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:40,022
Then we have certain tools in the game that we can use to kind of just trying to figure out what's, what's happening.

289
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:44,352
I can actually pause the game in the auto-debugger that we wrote for the game.

290
00:18:44,352 --> 00:18:50,827
And I'm going to, you know, basically step through frame by frame in this particular case.

291
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:54,877
And then I very often will just look at, OK, so first of all, do those numbers line up?

292
00:18:54,877 --> 00:19:00,165
Because like, you know, the camera, animation has to be at the exact same frame, then the characters.

293
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:06,191
And I already see like, you know, this set of frames, 732 and this is like at the frame 734.

294
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:08,987
So like weird, why is this happening.

295
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:18,614
And then I basically will have to go into visual studio where they'll, you know, the code is for the game, like animation control.

296
00:19:18,614 --> 00:19:22,923
A lot of what I do is actually just understanding what is going on.

297
00:19:22,923 --> 00:19:25,082
Like that takes 95 percent of the time.

298
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:30,973
Once you know what's going on, very often the fix is pretty easy, but you know, since there's so much code and so much things,

299
00:19:30,973 --> 00:19:36,479
so many things going on at the same time, the understanding what is actually happening is usually the way, way, way more

300
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:41,018
difficult part of actually implementing a fix for it.

301
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:46,596
But yeah, I mean, that's like in a nutshell what's going on.

302
00:19:46,596 --> 00:19:49,753
Romero: And then on our end, I just try to get to the tasks.

303
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:56,595
Like we have a lot of bug regressions right now, just 'cause they're fixing quicker than we can check them to make, to verify that they're fixed.

304
00:19:56,595 --> 00:20:00,531
So we always have just a backlog of bugs we need to get through on that end.

305
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:01,507
And new bugs.

306
00:20:01,507 --> 00:20:02,644
Like I said, don't stop.

307
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:05,657
So at this point you can't afford to ignore any bug.

308
00:20:05,657 --> 00:20:07,306
So you see it, you report it.

309
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:13,343
Yeah, every time you hear a little groan or something coming from that end, that's probably every new bug.

310
00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:16,329
Franzke: I think animation is winning the bug count right now.

311
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:18,051
And it probably will be until the end.

312
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:22,504
So a lot of it is just, you know, animation polish and stuff like that.

313
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:26,967
I think they probably have like twice as many bugs, any of the other like departments.

314
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:30,264
Roberts: Yeah, and this is all animation bugs.

315
00:20:30,264 --> 00:20:33,372
So it's something like 130.

316
00:20:33,372 --> 00:20:36,303
Essentially right now the red ones are unfinished cut scenes.

317
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:41,166
And so that's what we're striving to do by tomorrow.

318
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,677
They're set by priority.

319
00:20:42,677 --> 00:20:48,197
And it doesn't, it doesn't show it here, but there's Pri-1, Pri-2, right down to 4, I think.

320
00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:51,889
Four would be like, it'd be nice to have, but not essential.

321
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:55,622
And 3 is like we should fix it, otherwise it'll look crappy.

322
00:20:55,622 --> 00:21:01,204
And 2 being it is going to look really bad and unfinished if we don't do this.

323
00:21:01,204 --> 00:21:04,615
And 1 being a breaker, like it actually just breaks the game.

324
00:21:04,615 --> 00:21:08,341
Gardner: When you get into bug fixing phase, a lot of time animators will be like oh, I want to,

325
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:13,856
like this is the animation that we should be polishing, but instead I'm polishing this animation because this is reported as a bug.

326
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,393
It's stuff that I'm like, that should be fixed and that should be fixed.

327
00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:17,660
Nobody cares.

328
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,953
Like, I'm like, like it's like high fantasy.

329
00:21:19,953 --> 00:21:23,104
Like I'm really into it, but like not everybody else is.

330
00:21:23,104 --> 00:21:30,650
Roberts: What I'm really trying to do is not get freaked out about, about things right now,

331
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,338
because the holidays are coming up and I just want to relax and rebuild my energy.

332
00:21:35,338 --> 00:21:37,050
And then come back strong.

333
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:42,720
We could be panicking right now and we probably should be panicking, but I'm not going to do that.

334
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,088
I'm Zen right now.

335
00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:48,781
I'm just going to, I'm just going to turn off and then when I come back on the second,

336
00:21:48,781 --> 00:21:51,089
that's, it'll be time to freak out for me.

337
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:58,806
Franzke: Again, I think the problem is to some degree, it feels like the release day is far away, but it's really not.

338
00:21:58,806 --> 00:22:00,819
Because it's like, oh, it's next year, right?

339
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,684
That's, you know, once you say that, we're going to release the game next year, that feels like, oh,

340
00:22:03,684 --> 00:22:05,834
that's so far away we don't really need to worry about it too much.

341
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:11,487
But I think in terms of working weeks that we have until the game ships is like two or two and a half.

342
00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:16,995
So it's really not that much time, given the amount of issues that are being reported.

343
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:19,640
It's somewhat scary for sure.

344
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:27,210
So yeah, it's like a lot of people do tend to work, you know, late hours now, starting now but then, you know, also people

345
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,118
leave for Christmas break and stuff like that.

346
00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:33,567
And so it's kind of a weird kind of thing going on.

347
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:35,248
Franzke: Say something or are we just standing here?

348
00:22:35,248 --> 00:22:36,361
Schafer: Yeah, we're all going to stand.

349
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:37,940
Kipnis: What are we saying?

350
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:41,309
Schafer: Happy holidays, I think we say.

351
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:42,686
That's what the Christmas card says.

352
00:22:42,686 --> 00:22:43,981
Well, I am going to say something.

353
00:22:43,981 --> 00:22:45,420
Rice: And then we'll all say "happy holidays".

354
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,406
Schafer: This is all going in and out.

355
00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:49,968
Hello, adventure gamers from everyone on the Broken Age team.

356
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,859
We just wanted to say happy holidays.

357
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:55,141
Happy holidays? Happy holidays.

358
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:56,228
Hey. Get back to work.

359
00:22:56,228 --> 00:22:57,908
Finish it, finish it.

360
00:23:03,553 --> 00:23:08,046
Ryken: We had one little portion of the tree showing, so we had two little ornaments that we put on it.

361
00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:10,445
Their mind will fill in the rest, right?

362
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:12,645
It'll be like, hey, great job.

363
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:33,720
[Music] Schafer: OK, hello, hello, everybody!

364
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:34,735
It's so nice to see you all.

365
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:35,840
Everyone here?

366
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,142
Everybody ready to go?

367
00:23:37,142 --> 00:23:38,481
Hello, Happy New Year to you all.

368
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:40,048
This is the first meeting since the new year began, right?

369
00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:41,291
Yeah, yeah, welcome back.

370
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:49,894
I'm so glad some of you survived the holidays and driving and you all decided to come work here for another year.

371
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:54,415
Speaking of that, Bagel's actually been here 13 years.

372
00:23:54,415 --> 00:23:58,719
[Applause] Schafer: No, no.

373
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:00,159
No clapping, he's not here.

374
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,770
Sorry, Bagel, you're not here.

375
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,971
Yeah, you can clap.

376
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:04,155
He's actually coming up to visit.

377
00:24:04,155 --> 00:24:06,188
Does anyone know when he's coming out to visit?

378
00:24:06,188 --> 00:24:10,363
He's coming here on, Offscreen Voice: On his fourteenth year.

379
00:24:10,363 --> 00:24:12,043
Schafer: And he'll be here for two weeks?

380
00:24:12,043 --> 00:24:13,243
Offscreen Voice: Until the 31st.

381
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,275
Schafer: OK, awesome.

382
00:24:15,415 --> 00:24:16,755
So then you can clap for him then.

383
00:24:18,342 --> 00:24:22,066
Let's talk about Red's for a second, just 'cause it's launching next Tuesday.

384
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:23,686
To backers.

385
00:24:23,686 --> 00:24:25,774
We are shipping this thing to backers.

386
00:24:25,774 --> 00:24:31,144
And then on the 28th it's going to go out to the regular rest of the world.

387
00:24:31,144 --> 00:24:32,206
But yeah, this is exciting.

388
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:34,800
We have, we're all working on the Bugzilla right now.

389
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,364
Everyone knows what they're doing pretty much, so why are having these days?

390
00:24:37,364 --> 00:24:38,462
I guess just to cheer everyone up.

391
00:24:38,462 --> 00:24:39,750
Hey, you guys!

392
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,101
We're going to ship a game.

393
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:42,454
Rice: Now I think let's talk about lockdown and stuff like that.

394
00:24:42,454 --> 00:24:44,824
Schafer: And that. So lock it down, people.

395
00:24:44,824 --> 00:24:46,264
Rice: Oliver, you want to talk about lockdown?

396
00:24:46,264 --> 00:24:48,024
Franzke: Sure. Lockdown, let's do it.

397
00:24:48,024 --> 00:24:50,685
It's good. Right.

398
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:55,813
I mean everybody's still working and I, I mean I see like lots of things still happening this week.

399
00:24:55,813 --> 00:24:59,792
However, I'm, I am going to get the release kind of branch ready.

400
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:07,657
Basically I'm going to manually integrate changes into the, like nothing goes into the branch without, you know, me looking at it,

401
00:25:07,657 --> 00:25:10,525
make sure that it's like, there are no risky changes going in.

402
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:13,840
And like the amount of risk is going to be reduced over time, for sure.

403
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,264
Just to make sure that the build is as stable as possible.

404
00:25:17,264 --> 00:25:20,407
So just like how we do in the past for build days.

405
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:27,590
Like we basically going to just try to play through the game and individual changes that need to go in for the 14th, they will be manually integrated.

406
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,687
Schafer: Talk to Oliver directly.

407
00:25:28,687 --> 00:25:29,967
And you'll make an angry face.

408
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:31,094
Franzke: I will make angry face.

409
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:33,118
Schafer: Show me the face you have to see if you want to add, yeah.

410
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:36,716
You'll have to look at that face if you want to add anything to the game after Thursday.

411
00:25:36,716 --> 00:25:42,951
Franzke: Right now Linux is driving me insane, but I'm sure, she'll do all good.

412
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:47,040
But other than that it looks pretty stable recently and I would like to keep it that way for sure.

413
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,038
Schafer: OK, great.

414
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:49,838
Any other questions?

415
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:50,518
All right.

416
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,954
Go check Bugzilla.

417
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,100
See you guys later.

418
00:25:54,514 --> 00:26:33,213
[Music] Crook: We're doing pretty good.

419
00:26:33,213 --> 00:26:38,174
We're at final stretch for the backer build.

420
00:26:38,174 --> 00:26:39,831
So this will be a Beta build.

421
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:44,334
So it needs to be, not completely bug-free, but mostly.

422
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:46,689
Last night I got home about 1:00.

423
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:52,189
I get home about 1:00 and then I couldn't sleep for about two, I just at in bed for two hours, just like thinking about today

424
00:26:52,189 --> 00:26:56,225
and what we had to get done and it's just like, just stupid.

425
00:26:56,225 --> 00:27:01,515
I got to, you know; see my kids and my wife.

426
00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:05,580
So yeah, I have an aunt that's visiting right now, I haven't seen her yet.

427
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,410
She's been here for like four days and I haven't, I literally haven't seen her yet.

428
00:27:11,982 --> 00:27:18,960
Crook: Yeah. Camden's getting hit probably the worst because cut scenes come in, you know, really late in the game.

429
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,200
Yeah, I think Camden has stayed here a couple nights.

430
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:27,723
Stoddard: I'm having to revisit a lot of things.

431
00:27:27,723 --> 00:27:34,239
Things get redesigned or they get polished and timing has to move around, which is cool.

432
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:37,208
But there's a lot.

433
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,347
[Explosion sound] OK. That's fine.

434
00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:50,500
This is a hard, hard crunch but it's more about getting it right.

435
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:57,292
And I've been on other crunches where it wasn't about that, it was about we got it wrong and now we have to fix it.

436
00:27:57,292 --> 00:28:06,610
I'm just here because I know if Double Fine makes it and really, really makes this happen, it's going to be amazing.

437
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,729
It's going to be an amazing company.

438
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:14,184
I mean, it's already good, but we're just like struggling for years.

439
00:28:14,184 --> 00:28:22,363
And I think a lot of people here kind of hang on because like they know, they know Tim, they know, they know the management,

440
00:28:22,363 --> 00:28:26,426
they know the vision and if it hits, it'll be really good.

441
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:27,598
It'll be really good.

442
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:30,058
So we're just hanging in.

443
00:28:31,284 --> 00:28:36,524
Schafer: We are launching Red's tomorrow, crazy time.

444
00:28:36,524 --> 00:28:38,450
All of our backers.

445
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,175
[Applause].

446
00:28:41,175 --> 00:28:43,650
Thank you to our team for working so hard.

447
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:51,698
We are going to the backers tomorrow and the rest of the general population, future backers, if you will, on the 28th.

448
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:57,223
Rice: Ah, we're about to launch a game.

449
00:28:59,243 --> 00:29:01,850
In eight minutes.

450
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:08,242
I feel like, I feel like I'm kind of even in the same boat as backers, which is that's this, a really surreal thing that's happening.

451
00:29:08,242 --> 00:29:10,578
I don't know.

452
00:29:10,578 --> 00:29:18,492
It's been a long time in the making, you know, it's two years almost now since we launched the Kickstarter and yeah.

453
00:29:18,492 --> 00:29:26,462
Sometimes it just felt like it was never going to get here and now it's here and you know, this is something that really shouldn't exist.

454
00:29:26,462 --> 00:29:33,289
Like it's crazy that this exists and was able to be made this way and that the game that we've made is something that's coming out.

455
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:40,735
You know, I grew up playing Tim's old adventure games, young, like in elementary school.

456
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:49,853
And I feel like they were kind of the games that showed me that games could be like an art or could be something different or something bigger.

457
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:55,687
And you know, the fact that I'm here now, like working on this game and putting this out

458
00:29:55,687 --> 00:29:59,643
is really a dream and the weirdest thing that's ever happened.

459
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:00,985
And the best thing that's ever happened to me.

460
00:30:00,985 --> 00:30:04,013
So it's exciting.

461
00:30:04,013 --> 00:30:05,741
Schafer: All right. I've got to call my mom and say happy birthday.

462
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:08,202
Rice: What?

463
00:30:08,202 --> 00:30:10,060
Schafer: I got to call my mom and say happy birthday.

464
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,191
Rice: Oh, yeah. Do that.

465
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:14,171
Schafer: We're releasing our game today.

466
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:23,217
Yeah, well, it's, it should go out at 10:00, which is now so it's going to be out there.

467
00:30:23,217 --> 00:30:24,857
And Dad can help you download it.

468
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,040
OK, happy birthday, mom.

469
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,700
Rice: The game is up.

470
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:33,445
Preorders are up.

471
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:35,280
Schafer: Whoohoo! Rice: Yeah.

472
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,373
Schafer: All right, next game.

473
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:39,126
Rice: Yeah, we're going to take everybody out.

474
00:30:39,126 --> 00:30:43,525
So there's going to be a team lunch today, probably drinks later, too.

475
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:46,880
I'm going out for drinks, so I hope people will join me.

476
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,811
But yeah, we're going to take everybody out for lunch and thank them for all the hard work

477
00:30:51,811 --> 00:30:56,359
and just take a nice breather before diving back into Two Act.

478
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:59,079
Schafer: So thanks, everybody.

479
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:15,060
[Clinking glasses] [Music]

480
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,140
Schafer: Hey it's Nathan Bagel Stapely!

481
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:35,740
[Applause] [Music]

482
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:37,810
Schafer: This is downloading, start playing now.

483
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,630
Let's hope you did a good job, Tim.

484
00:31:42,661 --> 00:31:46,168
Me and my two girls sitting on my lap, can't wait.

485
00:31:46,168 --> 00:31:48,608
Sounds like I'd buy that for a dollar.

486
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,206
Played 30 minutes, very happy so far.

487
00:31:52,206 --> 00:31:56,254
Thanks to you and the Double Fine team. Rice: Yay!

488
00:31:56,254 --> 00:31:59,375
Schafer: It's like send any little bit of feedback.

489
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,339
OK, I need some more proof that people are playing it.

490
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:04,165
Rice: Tim, there's Twitch streams.

491
00:32:04,165 --> 00:32:06,399
Schafer: Well, I don't want to watch that.

492
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,939
Well, maybe I do.

493
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,598
Oh, man. This is weird.

494
00:32:17,598 --> 00:32:20,043
He's going to pick avalanche, no, foreign body.

495
00:32:20,043 --> 00:32:21,923
Foreign body, hull. Train.

496
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:25,540
Foreign body, oh! Avalanche!

497
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,934
That's good. Very good, avalanche.

498
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:29,634
Now I'm totally into watching that.

499
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,371
Schafer: What if he just said something really crappy right now.

500
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,471
Computer Voice: All right.

501
00:32:44,471 --> 00:32:46,855
Looks like that'll be it, guys.

502
00:32:46,855 --> 00:32:54,784
Thanks a lot for watching and if anyone who is watching is involved in making this in any shape or form, then congratulations.

503
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,554
I think this is a winner.

504
00:32:57,554 --> 00:33:43,326
[Music] Game Character: I'm going to sit here forever.

505
00:33:43,634 --> 00:33:44,774
Offscreen Voice: But I don't know I need those yet.

506
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,280
Schafer: Because you fell through the clouds.

507
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,370
Offscreen Voice: I don't know why my character knows that she needs them, 'cause she hasn't heard any...

508
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,628
Schafer: She's just interested in shoes.

509
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:52,873
Offscreen Voice: No, that's not true.

510
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,040
Schafer: And she fell through the clouds.

511
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,302
Offscreen Voice: The other guys in there said that I needed shoes.

512
00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:56,402
Schafer: Yeah.

513
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,680
Offscreen Voice: I don't know if I clicked on that dialogue option, though.

514
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,520
Game Character: What are you doing down here?

515
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,700
Vella: I'm an offering for the Maidens Feast.

516
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,677
Schafer: She fell through the clouds.

517
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,560
Obviously she knows she needs cloud shoes.

518
00:34:11,252 --> 00:34:12,806
You're playing it wrong.

519
00:34:12,806 --> 00:34:14,706
Game Character: Kind of shabby looking for a Maidens Feast.
