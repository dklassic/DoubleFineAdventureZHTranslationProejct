1
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,899
Schafer: It's mostly blank.

2
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:30,399
Schafer: Here's the Double Fine Adventure stuff.

3
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,833
Let's see how far I got. Let's see.

4
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,399
It was interesting because I didn't have any ideas for the game.

5
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,100
You know, I was just thinking what it was going to be about.

6
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,000
And on the first day I sat down and wrote.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,666
There's nothing on the first page.

8
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,633
And then I write about the end of the second page.

9
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:48,633
The start of the third page, basically I had the idea of the entire game.

10
00:00:48,633 --> 00:01:20,466
[music] Schafer: March 13th.

11
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:22,766
Offscreen Voice: It's been exactly a month, actually.

12
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:24,433
Schafer: Oh, it's been exactly a month. What happened since then?

13
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:27,433
Schafer: It's funny.

14
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:31,666
I told people, everyone, a lot of people thought that we'd already had an idea for a game.

15
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:36,200
Dutton: I guess what we know about it, it's going to be 2-D and it's going to be kind of old school.

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,466
Can you give us any other little tidbits about what you've got in store?

17
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:46,500
Schafer: I was just trying to think of a fake tidbit to give you, like it's all going to be about chinchillas.

18
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,000
Did I mention that? I mean, it's obvious.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,500
As soon as you said "old school adventure", it's going to be mostly chinchilla based, lot of fur tech.

20
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,299
There's going to be a lot of nudity, super-violent.

21
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:59,633
It's going to be the first actual snuff game.

22
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:02,133
I think that's pretty out, that was clear in the Kickstarter pitch.

23
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,599
Dutton: Who are you going to kill?

24
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,033
Schafer: The team.

25
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:06,900
Dutton: All of them? Ron, as well?

26
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,199
Schafer: Yeah. He's only half alive right now anyway.

27
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,766
A lot of people thought we had an idea for a game or a game all designed, ready to go.

28
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,400
And they're like, of course, they're not idiots.

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,900
They're going to have something ready to go.

30
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,099
And I was like, no.

31
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:21,433
'Cause I want to do all this, like you know, we're going to document everything and start when the cameras are rolling.

32
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,199
We're going to document the whole thing.

33
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,800
And so I didn't have an idea.

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,966
And I was a little scared, except for, I think it's just because now I've been you know, doing this for a long time.

35
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:34,866
I have, you got a certain amount of faith that you will sit down and the ideas will come.

36
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:39,366
Because they come if you just put enough time sitting down with the notebook, writing.

37
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:40,733
Something will happen.

38
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:42,699
And this is like the first entry in the notebook.

39
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:48,500
It's dated 3-15, which I think is the day, it's the day after it closed.

40
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:58,266
This morning I came in and this is like the first time I've I had a day after the Kick Starter ended.

41
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:02,366
So I thought I'd just actually get to work on this game that we're working on.

42
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:06,233
So the first thing I do when I'm working on a game, is I start writing.

43
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:09,766
These are all my notebooks.

44
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:14,233
I just started a new notebook and it's already covered with stickers.

45
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:17,233
And I start writing, so...

46
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:24,000
And I sat down, and the first page is me thinking about a code name for the game.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,833
Then I'm talking about some girls in the sixth grade for some reason.

48
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,933
And then I'm complaining about my memory problems.

49
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:34,933
It's about like, the process of getting ideas out of your head.

50
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:40,300
So when I'm really disciplined and on it, I will come in every morning and lock myself in my office

51
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,166
and just do free writing.

52
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:49,966
And free writing is something I actually learned in junior high school, but I started doing a lot in college

53
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:53,400
because it's the way of getting past that hump of like the blank page.

54
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,366
It's kind of intimidating. Want me show you one?

55
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:56,666
Scary!

56
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,766
What do you put on here? Oh, god, you know.

57
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:03,500
And then, and then I'm like going over this list of old ideas, like what.

58
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,633
And then I'm talking about whether I should hire this person, but then, because like, this is ,

59
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:09,400
this is where I sit down in the morning and I start writing.

60
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,266
And I have to keep writing. And that's why ridiculous things come out.

61
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:16,033
And I started this morning for the first time on Double Fine Adventure.

62
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:18,733
Double Fine Adventure Adventure.

63
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:24,800
I don't even want to show you what I'm writing, because someone's going to like download it and be like, I've decoded the first notes.

64
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,733
And now I start talking about the game.

65
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:30,433
And now I start thinking about, should I do this idea?

66
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:32,433
I've been thinking about this, this idea.

67
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:35,933
I've been thinking about this idea and then right here, you can see there's a little star and a line,

68
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:37,699
like this is where I had the idea for the game.

69
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:40,033
So at least, it took at least three pages.

70
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:47,733
Schafer: Well, I can't tell you that, because I'm not sure if I like it or not.

71
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:53,666
And it seemed like, sometimes it seems like you're not having any ideas, but you realize as you go over the last week there are like,

72
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,600
every day had some little tiny thing that moved it forward.

73
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,933
And it's like you've got to move forward a little bit, because you get to that next deep well of ideas, you know.

74
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:05,500
The first day, the most productive day like, oh, it can fit together like this. This is great.

75
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,100
And then, then I get a couple more ideas.

76
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,466
You can see the stars and the stars here.

77
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:14,300
And there're some days where no stars happen.

78
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:20,100
And I start writing the name ideas down here as you've seen before.

79
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:26,899
Because I do a lot, you do a lot of name brainstorming where you just write, ah, write down all these dumb names, trying to come up the name of the character.

80
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:32,000
I remember there's a page where I came up with the name Grim Fandango and wrote it really big and I was pretty excited about it.

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,366
Here's a copy of my notebook for Grim Fandango.

82
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:43,533
Let's see. Here's me talking about Mexican folklore and then here's me trying to figure out the name of the game.

83
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:44,933
Dead Leads. Deadly Deeds.

84
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:47,233
Deeds of Death. Death's Deeds.

85
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:49,766
Here's trying to come up with ideas for the name.

86
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,899
Reapers Holiday. Reapers Road Trip. Reapers Rendezvous.

87
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:54,833
Reapers Last Ride. Reapers Road. Trail of the Reaper.

88
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,899
Tools of the Reaper. Death as a Salesman. Oh, that's been taken.

89
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,566
Reaper Man. That's pretty good, Reaper Man.

90
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:02,333
The Remorseful Reaper. Bone to Lose.

91
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,166
Glen Gary Glen Reaper. Fear the Reaper.

92
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,800
Growl Reaper. Dougie Reaper. Dougie Reaper?

93
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,866
Reaping Ivy. Bony Manifesto. Friendly Reaper.

94
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:13,933
Chimp Reaper. That would have been good.

95
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,866
Oh, no. Not again.

96
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:19,066
Grim Journey. Hungry Hunted. The Last Reap. The Final Reap.

97
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:20,800
I put a box around the Last Reap.

98
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,833
Like that must have been a favorite idea for a while.

99
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,666
Grim Reaper. Grim Reaper. I'm still doing it.

100
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:32,566
You can tell my fear is starting to mount, as I'm like, am I ever going to come up with a name for this game?

101
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:36,133
Oh my God. Ah! Something otherworld.

102
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:38,533
Something figures. The Last Fiesta. Grim Fandango.

103
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:42,933
I'm such a fucking genius.

104
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:46,100
Ah, you can see what a relief that was.

105
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,500
Offscreen Voice: I guess it's been a real long time since you made a 2-D adventure game.

106
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,466
Schafer: Um hm.

107
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:53,533
Dutton: But do you think you've still got it?

108
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:57,166
Like, you still, are you still in touch with those skills?

109
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:02,666
Schafer: And actually I've been doing like, I've been doing these interviews and surveys and you know,

110
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:10,433
discussions, like you know, about trying to figure out adventure games, history and what was good and bad and what we can change about them.

111
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:11,699
Wolpaw: These are all the ones you made, right?

112
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,633
And along the wall? Grim Fandango? I played Grim Fandango.

113
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:20,133
Monkey Island, didn't play. Day of the Tentacle, I didn't play.

114
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:22,033
Full Throttle, I didn't. Psychonauts is good.

115
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:25,466
Schafer: Yeah, yeah. The writing was half good.

116
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:29,166
Wolpaw: Yeah. There was... half of it was pretty good.

117
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:35,366
But yeah. I don't know. You're making an adventure game.

118
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:38,833
You going to do something different to make it better?

119
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:43,166
Schafer: I'm trying to split up what was good about them and what was, what have we learned since and what was better.

120
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,766
What could be made better about them.

121
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:48,000
'Cause I don't want to make it just like a nostalgia thing.

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,033
Schafer: I think it's interesting to think about why people like adventure games.

123
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:54,699
And really what they like about them.

124
00:07:54,699 --> 00:08:01,600
Not just like someone who remembers, Monkey Island from like, oh, when I was 12 I played Monkey Island. I'd love to go play that again.

125
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,466
But who are actually playing them now and like what they actually enjoy about them.

126
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:11,766
Gilbert: Why is that a game like, you know, Monkey Island or Maniac Mansion that was made, you know, 20 years ago,

127
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:13,966
why is it that people still love those games?

128
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:20,533
Why is it that people post hundreds of videos on YouTube of themselves playing the music from those games?

129
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:27,333
What, what was it about those that, that really was so interesting and touched people like that?

130
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:35,100
Gilbert: So is a lot of the interest that people have today in adventure games, is that more, do you think that's more nostalgia based?

131
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:44,032
Because there're a lot of people who love adventure games, but do they love the nostalgia of them as opposed to the actual adventure games?

132
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:52,000
Gilbert: You know, you want to do something that really focuses on what made those old point-and-click adventure games a lot of fun

133
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and I mean, there's just like a rabid fan base for those things as we obviously saw.

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,366
So you know, you really want to take from those games what made them really special.

135
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:11,266
But I also don't think you just want to go make a 2-D point-and-click adventure game,

136
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:13,899
you know, with the little cursor that moves around and all that.

137
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:21,299
Because I could never go back and just design Monkey Island again, because I'm a different person today, you know, than I was back then.

138
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:24,799
The world has changed. Gamers have changed, you know, we've changed.

139
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:33,733
And so there's a lot, I think there's a lot that has to evolve in them and you know, I don't know exactly what those are off the top of my head.

140
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:39,533
But they do need to evolve, but they need to evolve in such a way that they don't lose the spirit of them

141
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:44,066
and they don't lose what made them so interesting to people.

142
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:50,500
Schafer: The things that came up most, when we talked about what was good about adventure games were the pacing of them.

143
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,866
I think that's important that people like a game that moves at their pace.

144
00:09:53,866 --> 00:10:05,000
I mean, obviously story and characters, even though the games have those, I still think adventure games are the genre that still puts them as the number one thing.

145
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:08,133
Schafer: Hi, guys. I'm late for another meeting.

146
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,299
Schafer: You can talk about now or back then.

147
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:16,766
What you remember as the like, dislike the most about adventure games and the most frustrating moments you had?

148
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:19,700
Who wants to answer that one first?

149
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,600
Chi: Pixel hunting, for sure. That was really frustrating.

150
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,566
Schafer: Do you remember an example of that?

151
00:10:27,566 --> 00:10:31,166
Chi: I think it was either in A King's Quest or Gabriel Knight game.

152
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,733
Schafer: It's going to seem fishy if you only pick Sierra games for the bad example.

153
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,266
Chi: Well, that's, that's the thing.

154
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:39,899
Because the Lucas Arts games had the same thing.

155
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,299
Schafer: I've already apologized for that one.

156
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:46,666
Schafer: One of the interesting advantages of adventure, well, I was thinking about the, a lot of people I talked to

157
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:52,833
had the same experience of early adventure, the first adventure game experience was like this promise of infinite possibility.

158
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,799
LeBreton: When I first started playing adventure games, I was like a kid and I didn't really understand games.

159
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:02,066
Games were still magical to me so I'd boot it up and I had no idea of what to expect. Like I had a Commodore 64.

160
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:06,966
You know, just like, I don't know, it just created this feeling of completely crazy, open-ended possibility.

161
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:13,233
Schafer: That's hard to still execute on that promise of infinite possibility I think with a modern adventure game.

162
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:18,133
When you were playing Machinarium you don't have that feeling like, I'm Mr. Robot and I can do whatever I want in this world.

163
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:25,399
It's more like this game about finding where the interaction is and what are the, what are all the interactions I can have in this world.

164
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:32,600
Dvorsky: It should be more about playing with the game than trying to beat it as soon as possible.

165
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:43,333
So you should be able to enjoy some places and situations, even for several times, even if you solved it already.

166
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:53,166
It should be fun to play that little puzzle or little interactive toy, again just for fun.

167
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:56,133
Wolpaw: I mean, I like that they have a, that they were funny.

168
00:11:56,133 --> 00:12:00,399
They're kind of whimsical. I guess I just didn't like the puzzles maybe.

169
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,200
Schafer: Puzzles.

170
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,600
So you would say you would never advocate a game that had puzzles in it?

171
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,333
Wolpaw: No. No.

172
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,100
Schafer: Like Portal, for example.

173
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,066
Schafer: One of the big questions was whether or not games should have puzzles in them, in adventure games.

174
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:17,133
That came up when we were talking to the Super Brothers, Craig and Chris.

175
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:23,233
About Sword and Sorcery, about how when they played the old adventure games the thing that didn't hold up for them was the puzzles,

176
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:25,333
because there were these blocks to the flow.

177
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,000
They really wanted the flow to happen.

178
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,933
Adams: And actually those types of mechanics, that sort of inventory puzzles, are things that I don't miss from older adventure games.

179
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:39,399
What I love about older adventure games is that there's, you have a flow and there's a story and there's characters.

180
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,100
And it just kind of surprises you.

181
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,866
And it was never figuring out, you know, which little pixel and which screen do I combine with the other.

182
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:50,100
So, but we tried to make it more just flow.

183
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,133
Schafer: I thought about that for a long time.

184
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:56,033
It was like, is that, are puzzles an antiquated, you know, notion for these games?

185
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:58,600
Are they a block to the narrative flow?

186
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,200
But I felt like in the end that wasn't the case for the game we were making.

187
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,533
I think the game they were making was a really specific, like for what they wanted to make,

188
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:09,399
it wouldn't have suited their purposes to have a bunch of like, head scratchers.

189
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:11,833
Piotrowski: But that was really a challenging moment.

190
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:16,533
It was kind of like trying to shed some of those things that were like buried in our heads from playing all these games when we were kids.

191
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:20,733
Schafer: Like what, talking about adventure games, people's memories of playing adventure games when they were kids.

192
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,033
So many of them were like, that's the only thing I had to do that summer.

193
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:26,533
I got stuck in my grandma's house for the summer and I played Day of the Tentacle every day.

194
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:31,333
Like, I mean, people have so many options now for entertainment.

195
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:37,166
It's going to be really hard to make sure that there's something really sticky about the game that makes them want to come back.

196
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,766
I think a lot of that is atmosphere. For me.

197
00:13:39,766 --> 00:13:43,899
Like, when I, you know, you feel haunted by a game sometimes.

198
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:47,933
Like you're just at your work or you're at school and you think about the music and you think about the world

199
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:51,233
and you're like, I really, that world feels so real that you want to go back there.

200
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:53,299
That's the goal on it.

201
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,500
You know, that's the way you keep people playing an adventure game.

202
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,533
Wolpaw: So anyway, did that help?

203
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,600
Is what I'm telling you helping at all?

204
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Schafer: Don't try to improve adventure games because they're always bad.

205
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,799
Just make an old bad one.

206
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,100
Wolpaw: Yeah, make one of your old bad ones.

207
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,399
Schafer: Ok, good. Well, thank you Eric Wolpaw for coming.

208
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,533
And spreading your special brand of love.

209
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:14,866
Wolpaw: Yeah, I mean, I'm just kidding.

210
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:21,359
I really do think the adventure game you make will be about as good as the old ones you made.

211
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:40,433
[music] Schafer: Oh, man. I love looking at this font. It just makes me so happy. It takes me back.

212
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:43,366
We should do one of these games.

213
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:46,166
Point-and-click adventures are awesome.

214
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:51,566
Schafer: I repeat a lot, I kind of recap sometimes, like where I am so far, like what I have.

215
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:54,399
Activities in one story affect the other, customizing.

216
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,033
This is a drawing that I hope will become the title for the box, cover of the box.

217
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:02,700
Here's story boards about the same intro.

218
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:09,000
I started writing some, no, I'm not going to read you those names yet.

219
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:20,133
And there's a certain point you just kind of instinctively know, ok, now I need to talk to somebody.

220
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:25,966
Because you kind of feel like, ok, this is as far as I can go right now with what's in my head.

221
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,399
Schafer: So I was thinking about this game.

222
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,799
And I had an idea.

223
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,966
Well, the first thing I did, well, forget about it now.

224
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:35,000
Let me start over, ok.

225
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Gilbert: Would you like to read your notes?

226
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,433
Schafer: And then you talk to somebody who you feel, ok, you're kind of taking a risk,

227
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:46,866
because you're exposing all your ideas to somebody for the first time and they might laugh at you.

228
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:55,933
Schafer: My idea for the story, the story idea for this game is about two stories, kind of happening side by side about a boy and a girl.

229
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:59,533
And they're in totally different worlds and at different places.

230
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:02,433
Gilbert: Different realities or just different places they go?

231
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:05,033
Schafer: Well, that's a good question. That's an interesting question.

232
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:07,933
Gilbert: I'm jumping ahead. Schafer: We don't know.

233
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:12,799
Schafer: Mostly I just get this relief that I told somebody about the game and they didn't tell me it was stupid.

234
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,333
But maybe they'll get inspired and they'll say a whole bunch of other things.

235
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:21,299
Then you can take back into the cave with you and like, ah, now I have a whole bunch of stuff to chew on and like,

236
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:24,133
ideas to bounce around and more dots to play with.

237
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:26,399
It's hard to tell your ideas to people.

238
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,533
Schafer: That mostly sets it up, except for my awesome story boards that I did.

239
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,299
That was the idea for the intro.

240
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:35,633
See, he's leaning, they're leaning against that wall and he's in a spaceship.

241
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:37,700
And she's looking at a castle.

242
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,899
Gilbert: And then you just choose then, one you want to start with?

243
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,933
Schafer: Yeah.

244
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:48,333
Schafer: The story so far, the reason I'm excited about it is that I've never done a story about this type, like this age of character.

245
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,366
Like a coming of age story.

246
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:59,366
About a boy and a girl, something about that the pairing of those like equal stories going on at the same time.

247
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:10,766
And the things I guess that are interesting about that age to me are, it's an age where you're learning to take control and take some power in your life

248
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:13,733
and also the responsibility that goes along with that.

249
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:20,766
You know, you're learning that you have power in your life and you're learning you have the power to control your destiny.

250
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:28,733
You have the power to hurt people and then kind of, you know, becoming an adult or becoming a young adult is about learning that

251
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:31,833
you can grab the wheel of your life and steer it in a different direction.

252
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:35,533
I think that's, but then you take the responsibility for what you've done.

253
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:41,033
And now no one's telling you, you know, that you're going to be ok if you go in this direction, because you've chosen to do it.

254
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:48,200
Gilbert: I think it's a really creative idea, but I don't think it's the kind of thing that we want to fund at this moment.

255
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,066
Schafer: That's great. That's so funny because that's so crazy.

256
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:56,799
Schafer: No. I mean, in some ways it's too early for feedback.

257
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:04,466
I mean, unless I'm totally am like, stealing an idea from something, because you can't say whether an idea is good or not in some ways in the beginning,

258
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:09,966
because so much is about the execution or the specifics of like how, you know.

259
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:13,799
Because it's kind of, it's kind of a vague pitch in a way.

260
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:22,433
It's like I want to do, I want to do this game that's about two stories, about a boy and a girl in really separate different worlds

261
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:25,599
who are navigating this space in between them.

262
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,566
You know, like that could mean a lot of different things.

263
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,299
That could be told many different ways.

264
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,633
So it's really hard for anyone to say like, oh, that's a good idea.

265
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:40,333
But I mean, because I do have, you do have some idea of how you're going to do it but you can't articulate all of it.

266
00:18:47,366 --> 00:18:50,200
Schafer: I'm ready for you.

267
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,166
It's like this, like this.

268
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,166
No, don't use that one! Oh, god, it's going to be the one you use.

269
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,666
I was doing my Magnum face.

270
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,866
Dutton: I mean, I guess people have put money down.

271
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:03,700
Some people have put a lot of money down.

272
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,000
Are you feeling real pressure to make sure it's good? Like more so than your other games?

273
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,833
Schafer: You know, people always ask that and I'm wondering what they thought I was going to do before.

274
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,333
Dutton: Take it and run.

275
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,533
Schafer: I can't wait to make this crappy game.

276
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:18,000
Schafer: I don't know.

277
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,266
I mean, I was scared about some things that will happen on the project, which is, did we already talk about people being disappointed?

278
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:28,933
Well, once we talk about what the game actually is, we talk about this boy and this girl,

279
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:35,066
there's going to be some people who are disappointed that it's not about an armadillo or spider or whatever they hoped it would be.

280
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:37,000
There's a game.

281
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,200
But it just collapsed from infinite possibility into this one particular game.

282
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,933
The Internet: See, the Internet has just given you a lot of money.

283
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,000
Over two million dollars.

284
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Now, if it appeared that you were wasting this money to make an inferior product, that would be very disappointing.

285
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,033
Schafer: I think people who think, there're a lot of people who ask me, do you feel a lot of pressure now, are you scared?

286
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:07,033
And I think they just don't realize what I do all day, 'cause a lot of my day is like, you know, in the past year,

287
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:08,533
it's been like, look at the bank account.

288
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:11,333
There's no money in there. I guess I'll fire everyone today.

289
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,966
You know what I mean? That's, that's pressure. That's scary.

290
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:16,766
Like I'm sweating now just thinking about that.

291
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:18,900
And I don't have to worry about that for a long time.

292
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,666
And that's great.

293
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:28,966
But also, sitting around thinking about what my hero should do until Act Three, like that is the most easy, pleasant part of my day.

294
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:35,766
You know, the time I spend locked in my office in the morning writing is like, I feel like I'm a kid again, 'cause this is like, that's the easy part of my job.

295
00:20:35,766 --> 00:20:41,166
And you know, over the past 20 years I've built a company, which puts a lot of things added onto that.

296
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,700
Like thinking about business. Thinking about HR.

297
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:49,900
Thinking about negotiating a deal with a publisher and thinking about payroll and then thinking about team management

298
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,599
and who should be the next project leader and what game should they work on.

299
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:55,133
And these two people aren't getting along.

300
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:57,500
The building's going to turn off our power on Thursday.

301
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,633
And there's all these things, like this is what, like the totality of the company.

302
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:02,599
These are all things I think about.

303
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:05,166
And just me sitting in my office with my notebook is like a little vacation.

304
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,633
Like, you know what, then a spaceship could come down and yeah, it'd be great.

305
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:14,666
So I'm having a blast with that stuff.

306
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:55,000
[music] Schafer: Maybe they're just in it for the documentary.

307
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,533
I think a lot of people are.

308
00:21:56,533 --> 00:22:02,933
And in the process, I think people, you know, want to see the creative process and the story of us making the game.

309
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:05,466
There's a difference, obviously, telling the story.

310
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:06,426
But who knows?

311
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:08,420
They'll get the game, they'll start it up and they'll be like, oh, yeah!

312
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:10,933
I have to point-and-click all this stuff? Ah!

313
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:12,766
And now I don't know what to do.

314
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:15,799
I have to think about a solution to a, ugh.

315
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,599
But who cares? We got their money, right?

316
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,879
Am I right, you guys?

317
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:26,506
Just kidding.

318
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:28,726
It's going to be awesome. You're going to love it.

319
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:33,760
