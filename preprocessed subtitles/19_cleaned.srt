1
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,336
Schafer: Oh, Brad is out. Okay.

2
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,371
Hello everybody.

3
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,405
Hi. It's good to see you.

4
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,706
Hello. Thank you for coming.

5
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:44,444
So, uh, it's Monday, and Friday was terrible.

6
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:45,812
Uh, all of you were here.

7
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:49,616
I want to just think everyone for, uh, showing so much class

8
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:50,817
going through that difficult day.

9
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:54,454
You guys all, um, uh, held together nicely.

10
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:58,525
It was a rough day on everybody and, um, I think you showed a lot of compassion

11
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:03,196
for the people who are leaving and also understanding for those of us who had to make that decision,

12
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,265
and it really helped us get through it.

13
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:09,002
And we will--we are getting through it, and it's, um...

14
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,539
Now we have a bunch of games we gotta make and stuff to do.

15
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:17,844
Um, we are still helping the people who need letters of reference,

16
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,846
letters of recommendation, stuff like that.

17
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:23,450
Help--doing what we can to get them set up with new engagements.

18
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:28,522
Um, but other than that, we here are still working on these games.

19
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,694
Did you want to talk about the layoffs?

20
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,529
-Is that part of the documentary?

21
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,298
Talk about the layoffs. I'm gonna have a drink.

22
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,100
Can I drink on camera?

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,536
If the kids are watchin' this, kids, don't drink.

24
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:46,540
A week ago, we had a project canceled, an unannounced project from a publisher

25
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,874
that really liked the game.

26
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:51,278
We had just done our vertical slice and then gave us great feedback on it

27
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,046
and they said it was great and they really liked it.

28
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:58,352
And then the next call was they're canceling it for higher-up reasons.

29
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,988
Well, that was a big project that was funding a lot of people.

30
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:06,326
And--and then another one of our publishers from another project is having financial problems

31
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,161
and can't pay us.

32
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,498
Bailey: You know, it's public news now that Majesco is, um...

33
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,734
Pardon me.

34
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,735
Not timed there.

35
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:18,805
Majesco has made a public statement that

36
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:24,444
their, you know, continued ability to perform as--as a going concern is at stake and, of course,

37
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:28,715
we did Costume Quest 2 with them and the payments were not complete for that.

38
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:32,719
So we're actually-- we're owed money by Majesco that we're not getting paid.

39
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,990
And then, of course Costume Quest 2, um, because of that statement, you can infer

40
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,795
that it's not being marketed properly and it's not being distributed to its fullest extent

41
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:46,767
that you would expect from a publisher, because there-- you know, the means and the people there to do that

42
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,368
just don't exist anymore.

43
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,736
Um, so it's kind of a perfect storm.

44
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:53,206
It was a bad week to put it mildly.

45
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,308
So, glad that week's over.

46
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,645
If that publisher hadn't canceled it, you know, things would have been--

47
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,714
were looking really good for the studio.

48
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,817
Um, I think things are still looking really good for the studio,

49
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,720
but only because we took quick action.

50
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,256
Schafer: So we had to let go of 12 people.

51
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:15,629
Some of them, uh, had been here for a short period of time and some of them had been here for a long period of time,

52
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:16,863
over ten years.

53
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,133
So that was really hard.

54
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,703
Stoddard: What do you want to know, how I feel about them and-- Off camera: Yeah, yeah, how was it? I mean you--

55
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,238
Stoddard: It was horrible. -Yeah.

56
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,241
It was really horrible. Um...

57
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:34,514
I mean, I understand why it happened, but, like, we--the audio team was super tight, uh,

58
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,416
and now there's two of us instead of four.

59
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,318
Um, it was a heavy hit.

60
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,855
The day of the layoffs were just brutal.

61
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:47,494
Kipnis: Uh, well, I will say that the layoffs-- I wasn't actually at the office when it happened, so...

62
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:52,632
And, um, at first, like, I--I got-- I got text messages about it

63
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:56,103
and it was, uh...

64
00:03:56,103 --> 00:04:02,342
it was really tough to--to hear about it, um, and it--it was tough to, like, not be here to say goodbye

65
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,779
to some of those people that I've worked with for years and years

66
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:10,884
and, like, you know, I'm gonna miss a lot.

67
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:13,854
I don't know what else to say.

68
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:20,192
Crook: And you always feel a little bit guilty when you're still here, you know, and other people aren't,

69
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:28,235
um, and it hurts morale quite a bit, um, but...

70
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,304
but I know that it--I know that it was not taken lightly.

71
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,007
Hansen: It was the hardest day of my life.

72
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:40,580
I never thought we would be in that situation, but project cancelations happen and, you know,

73
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,749
sometimes you can absorb it and sometimes you can't.

74
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:49,489
So Tim and I almost avoided each other just 'cause we knew that we had to meet and talk about that.

75
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,259
And I didn't want to, and he didn't want to either.

76
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,495
There was no, like, oh, yeah, it's so easy, it's person X, Y, and Z.

77
00:04:55,495 --> 00:05:01,001
It's like every single one of those people are-- they're huge contributors to all these games we've made.

78
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:06,206
They're the people we hang out with after work and so-- And, you know, and it's tough for Double Fine in general,

79
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:10,343
because historically, I mean, we even said this in the media in the past,

80
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,345
we don't do layoffs and that sort of thing.

81
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:16,016
It was--it was a tough decision for sure.

82
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:20,053
Russell: A lot of us just stayed afterwards in the room, after we were told, and just talked about

83
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:23,823
the history of the company, and just, we were like, we couldn't believe this happened to us,

84
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,794
but you know, in the game industry and in any entertainment industry,

85
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,030
it's--it's the norm.

86
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:36,536
We're the exception, so in that respect I-- I--I feel lucky,

87
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:41,775
and we'll survive, a little bit smaller, a little leaner, but we'll make it.

88
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:56,990
[Music] Schafer: So basically we are powering forward on our, um,

89
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,826
uh, remaining titles that we're working on.

90
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,095
Those are the stories I really wanted to make the documentary about

91
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,831
but we could never do that, like, those publisher games,

92
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,235
to see, like, what it's like, all those meetings where they're saying,

93
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:12,806
"This game is so great, we can't wait to see it." And then the meeting where they actually said it's canceled,

94
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:16,676
we have to cancel it, but I hope you still make it 'cause I really want to play it.

95
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,512
That was an actual quote from the guy, he was like, "If you make it

96
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,082
I really want to play it." It's like, "Oh, thanks, that makes up

97
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,718
for me laying off 12 people.

98
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,554
That--I totally feel good now that you want to play this game

99
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:35,528
that you just killed." But, um, since I'm mostly fueled by angriness and bitterness,

100
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:39,699
then I'm stronger than ever right now.

101
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,704
You know, whatever works.

102
00:06:44,960 --> 00:07:12,560
[Music] [Chatter]

103
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,768
Schafer: Oh god, is that thing still here? Mitchell: It's way funnier now.

104
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,869
Muir: It was just sad. Mitchell: Yeah.

105
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,304
Muir: It wasn't bad. Mitchell: No.

106
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,205
Schafer: That one that you found under the sink?

107
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,774
Muir: It's really good. It's like, uh...

108
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,808
Mitchell: It's gooey, though.

109
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,310
Muir: Chipotle.

110
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,644
Schafer: Is everyone here?

111
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:28,315
[Murmuring] Hello, everybody! Hello.

112
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,984
And thank you for coming back to work here again for another year.

113
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,819
It's awesome to see you all here.

114
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:33,753
Welcome back.

115
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,755
Nice to see you all.

116
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:36,856
Rice: Yeah, man.

117
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,191
2015.

118
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,026
Schafer: 2015. Wait a second.

119
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,562
Does that mean we didn't finish in December?

120
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,797
Rice: Yeah.

121
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,732
Comin' on three years.

122
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:48,001
Schafer: Three--no kidding? It's like Rip Van Winkle.

123
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:53,073
All I remember is the Kickstarter, and then I woke up and it's three years later.

124
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,808
Crook: And we all have big, long--and we all have big, long beards.

125
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,643
Schafer: Yeah, we're just here with beards.

126
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,145
Ray, where did all that money go, what?

127
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,081
I guess we should ship this game.

128
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,316
But the game was awesome.

129
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:09,389
Um, but, um, but we-- I think I'm trying to this week still keep play testing,

130
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:13,493
especially the problem areas in the game where people get hung up the most

131
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,362
and catch any remaining dialogue.

132
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:19,532
There's probably some object interactions or examine lines that are still missing that I would love to catch.

133
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:23,837
Please keep talking and don't be freaked out that we're not answering you, 'cause we'd just like

134
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,105
to hear what you're thinking.

135
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,840
Miller: All right.

136
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,675
I'm already baffled.

137
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,877
Vella: Is this one?

138
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,645
Miller: This must be incredibly fun to watch.

139
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:35,481
Schafer: We're not even here.

140
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:36,850
Miller: What's that? You're not paying attention?

141
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,284
Schafer: Yeah, I'm doing my taxes over here.

142
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:43,857
Miller: I think I'll switch to Shay 'cause I can't figure this out.

143
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,794
Schafer: I mean, it's--it--that-- the first puzzle, it's, like, one of the first puzzles that Vella has,

144
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:53,333
and you have to do something and get this visual feedback, and you have to mess with it a lot and get some more feedback

145
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,835
to kind of figure out the patterns.

146
00:08:55,835 --> 00:09:00,540
Um, and then it's just a problem of, like, have we kind of inceptioned? Is that a verb?

147
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,710
Put the idea in the player's head of what they want to do enough.

148
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,312
'Cause sometimes you just mess with the game and you just kind of bang on it

149
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,149
and you--woo, you solved it, you don't really know how you solved it.

150
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,984
And that to me is almost a worst-case scenario.

151
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,319
That's almost worse than getting stuck forever, you know?

152
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,322
Like, getting-- 'cause being stuck forever, if you finally solve it you feel great.

153
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,325
But if you solve it in accident, you're like, I don't know what just happened, you move on

154
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,828
and you kind of get this kind of bored feeling.

155
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:25,031
And it's really easy to just accidently put this one line in

156
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,001
that makes everybody just know what to do immediately.

157
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:33,273
So it's--it's like a lot of-- 'cause time--time is short and we don't have much-- we don't have much time left,

158
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:36,443
and to solve these problems, to make sure that everyone gets through the game,

159
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:39,712
it's really tempting to just kind of, like, short circuit all the puzzles and make sure

160
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,714
that everybody can get through them.

161
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:46,719
But you have to kind of take a lot of time to actually really look, um, carefully at, like,

162
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,255
each mental leap the player is making.

163
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:54,027
[Off camera] If people were saying the first one was too easy and you're taking out a lot of the hints,

164
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,995
I mean, are you afraid you went too far in the other direction?

165
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,731
-It seems like there's a lot-- Schafer: Well, I'm hoping-- I'm hoping we went way too far.

166
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,434
Rice: But yeah, like Tim said, in general I think we're gonna keep play testing

167
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,004
in hopes that anything that we find that is a problem

168
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,873
down the road could be changed.

169
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:13,012
Crook: Are we gonna have-- with--with Ben leaving, are we having any other-- another GP coming on

170
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,248
or are we gonna be able to just absorb?

171
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:19,285
Peck: Um, well, it's my second to last day here at Double Fine.

172
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:25,458
And, uh, just trying to, like, put a bow on as many things as I could before leaving.

173
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:31,264
The place I'm going to is quite a bit-- it's like a larger company so...

174
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,466
I'm--yeah, I'm gonna miss the...

175
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:39,706
like, the small little scenes at the lunch table or, like, company meetings and stuff like that

176
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:46,746
where, like, it's okay to make a dick joke or, like, it's okay to...

177
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,015
to just kind of be yourself a bit.

178
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,584
Um...

179
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:58,324
I'm hoping I can kind of take a little bit of that for-- like, with me wherever I go, you know?

180
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:02,996
I feel bad I'm not gonna be there for, like, when the shit inevitably hits the fan, you know,

181
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,098
and the game needs to be finaled.

182
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,199
Kipnis: That jerk.

183
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,802
No, I mean, it sucks.

184
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:15,675
It sucks. I mean, Ben--Ben contributed a lot to the--to the game and, you know, we're--

185
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:21,781
we're having to kind of figure out some stuff in the code that he wrote when he could have been here to help us out.

186
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:27,754
I mean, it sucks, but, um, we'll just have to finish without him, you know?

187
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:35,595
Crook: I mean, I will say, you know, we've had to transition because, um, Lee left the project

188
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:40,400
and, um, that was-- that was scary, um, because he--he seemed to know

189
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,035
what was going on with everything.

190
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:47,440
And so I think Anna's had to take on a lot of some of the responsibilities that Lee had, um,

191
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,244
as far as puzzle chains and--and how those are all put together

192
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,379
and--and the logic.

193
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,316
Um, so I'm sure that's been stressful for her.

194
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,852
[Offscreen] Do you regret not getting to see Broken Age through to the end?

195
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,087
Petty: Yeah, you know, I'm trying to think.

196
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,224
I think this is the only time I haven't stayed on a project

197
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,558
all the way through.

198
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,128
It was a lot of those, um, small decisions right at the end of the project

199
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,698
that have a big impact on the game 'cause all the content's there

200
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:12,832
and it's all connected.

201
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,401
And sometimes just pushing and pulling a few things

202
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,671
can--it, um, can really help the game, and it's nice to be part of that.

203
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:23,843
But, uh, I don't think I'll be part of that for Act 2 anyways, but--

204
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:30,350
I think I'm--I'm excited for Act 2 to come out, because I think Act 1 had a lot of great things about it

205
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,721
but it was incomplete, and, you know, you can sort of see the whole arc or play the whole game,

206
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:38,825
might get a better sense of whether that was successful or not.

207
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:45,531
But hopefully I've helped set that up, um, to be a--to be a great experience.

208
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,866
Schafer: But we don't need anybody.

209
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,868
Broken Age team.

210
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,703
We don't-- we don't need nobody.

211
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,272
We'll finish it ourselves.

212
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,841
So where are we supposed to be right now, Alpha on the finale?

213
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,509
Rice: Yeah. You wanna look at the...

214
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,312
Schafer: When is beta on B2 and G2? Is that there?

215
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,781
Rice: Yeah, so we'll show you the timeline as it is right now.

216
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:06,719
Um, but Matt and Vic and I, and Malena are gonna meet this afternoon now, uh,

217
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,423
and want to get a lot more clarity into just closing out the project,

218
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:14,160
but also, like, these beta sprints and--and things like that as well.

219
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,764
Hansen: Right now there's a tendency for people to gravitate towards whatever is the, you know,

220
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:22,769
maybe the most interesting work, and that's not-- might not be the most, uh, highest priority work.

221
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:26,739
We just need to do some load balancing and some estimates as far as, like, how long is it gonna take

222
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,876
to get this shit done, 'cause people-- if people don't tell us that,

223
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:32,045
we might be fucked already and we don't even know it.

224
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,813
Rice: Um, but, yes, Ray, you're correct.

225
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:40,753
The, um, the right reaction to this is, it's a lot to do in two-- in two months and change.

226
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:44,023
Crook: Yeah. Rice: So, um, I think that's why we wanted to make sure that these dates

227
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,826
get in front of everybody's eyes and that people are looking at it differently.

228
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,329
Hansen: Is it reasonable? I mean, or are you-- or you're like, I don't know, man,

229
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,666
'cause your gut checks are usually pretty good.

230
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,735
Crook: Wow.

231
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:58,104
Yeah, but I think it's-- I think it'd be all right.

232
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,773
Do you think the GPs are gonna be--I mean, 'cause there was a time where

233
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,775
there were gonna be four of them.

234
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,477
Now there's two of them.

235
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:10,550
Rice: We're getting all the box stuff ready to go and actually manufacturing in, like, February, um,

236
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,253
to where discs would be pressed in mid-March.

237
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,824
Kipnis: Yeah, and the game--does the game run on the PS4?

238
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,692
Franzke: Nope. Kipnis: Yeah.

239
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:25,865
And--and I think it's really important to have a, "Okay, Tim, this is it, like, you can't..."

240
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:30,770
Hansen: Yeah. Kipnis: Like, absolute content complete from, like, Tim content complete maybe.

241
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,105
Hansen: Last call for alcohol.

242
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,272
Kipnis: Yeah, last call.

243
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,242
Let's just call it that, last call.

244
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:40,213
It's really hard to, as a creator, to turn yourself off.

245
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:44,817
What I want to do is be able to account for that and I want Tim to be able to do that.

246
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,720
I want him to be able to, like, "Oh, God, this is it, that's right,

247
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,225
I can't add anymore after this." And I want him to be able to, like, have that time

248
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:56,562
and account for it in our--in our milestone, like, timeline and stuff.

249
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,799
Because I want him to be, like, happy with what we come up with.

250
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:06,405
Because we know his creative process, it's important for us to schedule it appropriately.

251
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:10,343
Rice: Yeah, um... Kipnis: Yeah, I didn't realize, like, how soon the beta was.

252
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:15,014
Jesus Christ. Rice: Yeah, and I don't know, Matt, like, right now every-- there's a lot of hands on Grim,

253
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:18,151
but, like, obviously that's just a near-term problem that's being solved soon.

254
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:23,689
But after that, um, yeah, I don't know what kind of, uh, strings

255
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,693
we can pull with people on other teams, um, as needed.

256
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,797
Hansen: They can't. I mean, we have milestones. We won't get paid.

257
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,165
If we don't get paid then the studio shuts down.

258
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,866
Rice: That's what I thought.

259
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,301
So I was just making sure that that was the case.

260
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,404
Hansen: I'm just gonna be totally blunt with you guys, but you can't touch (redacted).

261
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,872
Kipnis: Yeah. Hansen: I'm sorry.

262
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,474
Franzke: Yeah.

263
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:42,742
All right. Rice: Cool.

264
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:43,776
Franzke: Let's make this happen, huh?

265
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,878
Rice: Yeah. All right.

266
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,147
Like, you guys are the right people to ask about this.

267
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,416
Like what--what does gut say about the timeline?

268
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,319
It's basically two months till pencils down.

269
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:58,157
Inversin: I'm not totally scared just yet, but I might be terrified.

270
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,226
We'll see.

271
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:03,763
[Offscreen] Did you get to learn anything from Lydia when she was still here?

272
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,231
Panya: No.

273
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:09,769
She had a lot of the Act 1 shader stuff, so, like, her signature's over everything

274
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,737
so I can pick up where she left off in that sense.

275
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:15,241
Uh, but she's not here for me to kind of ask questions.

276
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:19,011
Scheduling with effects is always kind of scary, 'cause there's always this, you know,

277
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:23,382
four-week window at the end for polish, and, of course everybody wants to polish at the end,

278
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,519
even design wants to polish, and that trickles down.

279
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,857
Animations get tweaked at the end, and then visual effects and sound effects

280
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:34,694
are the last two guys to kind of get, uh, to touch it.

281
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:40,600
So as long as everyone knows that the sound effects and the visual effects guys are last and they give some buffer,

282
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,402
then we shouldn't be too, uh, too screwed.

283
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:49,041
Stoddard: I want to make sure German gets hit because we have to re-volume graph

284
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:56,082
and re-special effects process all of the German recording for Act 1 and Act 2, and that's a tall order.

285
00:16:56,082 --> 00:17:01,854
Rice: Yeah, and it's getting delivered beginning of February, right, and then don't we--is the plan to have outsourcer on it

286
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,556
that should take, like, three weeks?

287
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,258
Stoddard: We--yeah. Hansen: We have Ashley coming in.

288
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,792
Stoddard: Yeah. Hansen: And she'll be, uh, helping...

289
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:09,794
-...specifically for this work. Rice: Yeah.

290
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:13,699
Schafer: I would like to ask you to join me in welcoming Ashley Coull to Double Fine.

291
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,834
There she is over there.

292
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,103
Ashley.

293
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:21,807
Coull: You know, a contract. It's a short amount of time and, you know, there-- there's no--there's no guarantee,

294
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:25,845
and it was a staggering amount of work as well, but, uh, the opportunity to be here

295
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:29,715
and be a part of this community, uh, Camden even pulled me out-- pulled me out of work one day,

296
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:34,553
and I think he got about halfway through the sentence of, "Hey, so there's this contract thing," and I was like, "Yes."

297
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:40,826
And he was like, "I--uh, yeah," and I was like, "Yeah." Um, and that's kind of how--how

298
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,828
the balls got--got rolling, I guess.

299
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:46,532
Schafer: Because we have German VO in the game, which is awesome, and it sounds crazy. I started playing it.

300
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,735
I mean, I don't mean crazy, I mean in a language that is not my own.

301
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,737
-German Vella: Hallo? Schafer: There we go.

302
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,274
[Coughing] That's a German cough, obviously.

303
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:59,045
[Disproving sigh] [Laughter]

304
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:02,148
I really like the German version. I'm gonna play through the whole thing in German.

305
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:05,184
Stoddard: Yeah, that was-- that was a-- the was a big, big thing,

306
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,154
so she's just-- she's kicking ass, Paul is kicking ass.

307
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,555
He really is stepping up.

308
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,358
I mean, it's like kind of both their moments to step up.

309
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,794
O'Rourke: I mean, it's always enjoyable. Tim's writing is hilarious most of the time

310
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:17,063
and it's really good to just-- like, usually when I'm editing--

311
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,165
I don't want to talk bad about, like, sports games or anything,

312
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,367
but if I had to edit, like, Madden dialogue all day,

313
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,468
probably kill myself.

314
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,204
But going through Tim's stuff is actually pretty enjoyable.

315
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,207
Um, I gave him a huge cut scene the other day.

316
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,376
Dude, here's a big moment, go do it,

317
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,345
come back when it's done.

318
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:35,815
And he came back and it was damn near perfect.

319
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:39,485
Like he nailed it, so I'm like, okay, I'm not worried anymore.

320
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,623
The layoffs were not good, um...

321
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:47,793
It's definitely-- This--this company is under stress.

322
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:52,765
Everybody is being super pro and they're making good product, but, like, it's-- it's heavy duty right now.

323
00:18:52,765 --> 00:19:00,639
And I'm just really happy to see this team kind of gel, uh, you know, in the trenches and really get it.

324
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,775
Me?

325
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:12,018
(speaking in German) [Offscreen] What was that? Franzke: I--what?

326
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:19,492
[Laughter] Coull: Uh, I said I'm editing all the German lines.

327
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,793
Franzke: Can I read-- can I read this?

328
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,631
[Laughter] Franzke: Oh.

329
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,467
Rice: We've gone through this now with all the leads, yeah,

330
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,137
but, um, yeah, now we wanted to present it it to you.

331
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:34,040
The next week is-- Schafer: Last set call.

332
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,841
Rice: Huh? Schafer: Tim last call...

333
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,343
Rice: Yeah, we'll get to that.

334
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,814
So like, tomorrow the hope is during stand-ups to, like, relay this whole thing to the entire team,

335
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,315
not just the leads.

336
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,651
And I feel like we gotta kinda give, like,

337
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:49,688
a bit of a sense of urgency and just, like, that kind of thing.

338
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:54,827
But I feel like it's also trying to put people's fears to rest, which would--I think one of the big ones is that,

339
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,629
like, we're gonna continue to iterate on the game...

340
00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:00,166
-...and things like that. Schafer: So terrify them with the deadlines and put all their fears to rest.

341
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:05,471
Rice: And then hopefully, uh, just pep rally, pump people up?

342
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:10,843
Schafer: If we use the words "dig deep" at any point, I'm just-- Hansen: Will you say it? Schafer: No.

343
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:13,279
Rice: No. Schafer: There's always a point where someone talks about digging deep,

344
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,482
and I just-- I don't want to say that.

345
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:17,817
So we all gotta dig deep, you guys.

346
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:21,053
Hansen: All right. Rice: Yeah, I pro-- I think I might put the dates

347
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,824
on the whiteboard again, too, just so everyone can look at them all the time.

348
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,826
Schafer: If they view that, they'll film it.

349
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:27,827
Rice: Yeah, red, white, and blue.

350
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,795
Romero: That's encouraging.

351
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,031
Broken Age, fuck yeah.

352
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,669
Schafer: Does that help?

353
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,338
Romero: Tim last call. Is that a milestone?

354
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,840
Rice: Fuck yes. Romero: Okay.

355
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,877
We submit to ratings boards on the fourth?

356
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:48,481
Rice: Yeah, I think it's that-- Kipnis: When do we know what line...?

357
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:52,017
Crook: Tim said he would try to call him. When he said you're hitting the line, it's okay.

358
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:55,721
Maybe I just gotta try to find one that...

359
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:59,425
Rice: Ready? So we've been meeting production team with the leads

360
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,161
to come up with closing plan stuff.

361
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:06,265
So next Friday we have our next Sony milestone, which Oliver is working on.

362
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,768
I think the big thing is PlayStation 4 running.

363
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,837
Schafer: Is there anything on there new or shocking to anyone?

364
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,706
Crook: It's all shocking, but nothing's new.

365
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,241
There's nothing new.

366
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:17,743
Schafer: There is a lot of stuff to do in a short amount of time,

367
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,846
but there's no big unknowns to me, at least, on it.

368
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:26,552
There's no design yet to do, dialogue yet to write, and big ques--

369
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:31,190
things that could explode into-- I mean, like, it seems like it's a known amount of work now

370
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:38,130
that can't expand, and, um, and it's clear that it can't slip

371
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,866
because you can see the commitments that are on it.

372
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:45,771
As far as I'm concerned, like, everything is just no-- everything just has to be pushed through the machinery,

373
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:50,442
and that's the easy part, except for it's hard.

374
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:54,280
No, we're--we're the dream team, all here together.

375
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,150
For some reason, to me it's always relaxing when it's finite even if it is tight

376
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,452
because you know when it's gonna be over.

377
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:04,823
These next three weeks are really where the game goes from being good to great mostly.

378
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:12,031
So, um, it's gonna be exciting and, uh, if we have to order food,

379
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,799
we'll order food.

380
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,234
Crook: Food.

381
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:16,836
Boston Market?

382
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:20,306
Schafer: No. Crook: Promise Boston Market, I'll-- Schafer: Wait, you want Boston-- Crook: I'll work late if you--

383
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:21,473
No, I'm just kidding. Kipnis: Wow.

384
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,677
Crook: Just kidding.

385
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,746
Schafer: If you've gotta lure a man away from his family, make it Boston Market.

386
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,215
Crook: Yeah.

387
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,749
Schafer: It's like there's love in that meal.

388
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,752
Kipnis: That's--that's what Caroline did for us during Psychonauts.

389
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,387
Remember that? Rice: Boston Market?

390
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,590
Kipnis: Boston Market, like, every night.

391
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,293
Crook: Yep. Kipnis: And, uh, and I gained-- I gained, like, 15 pounds during during crunch.

392
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,761
Schafer: That's to keep you in your seat.

393
00:22:43,380 --> 00:23:11,290
[Music] Schafer: Uh, on "Reds," we did a whole play-through of the team

394
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:16,495
of the finale of the game to figure out how to push that towards, um, completion.

395
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:21,400
We are also starting on the PS4 version.

396
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,536
Hansen: So we have a milestone on the 23rd, and that's to have it, like,

397
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:28,807
"playable," um, on that platform, so-- But it looks like that's come along really well,

398
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,377
so good job, Oliver.

399
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:34,680
Schafer: Look at it playing on the PS4.

400
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,049
[Offscreen] How's the port process been going in general?

401
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:40,519
Franzke: It's good. We essentially added PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita

402
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,689
to a list of platforms, but kept the ship date the same,

403
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:46,725
um, so that makes things a bit more interesting.

404
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,695
I love working on consoles, but it's a very different kind of challenge, like,

405
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:54,466
for example, the Vita is very memory constrained, um, so that, you know,

406
00:23:54,466 --> 00:24:01,874
it's--it's a very tight memory budget for--for the game, and if you're just leaking some memory somewhere,

407
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:05,744
like, you're gonna have a bad time later on, so there are, like, a lot of really interesting things

408
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,413
you need to take into consideration.

409
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,748
Or can you compress the data in some way and stuff like that.

410
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,785
And I think the end-- the end will be tough, for sure, shipping.

411
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:18,991
Like, so, for--for consoles, um, what you have to do in order to release games

412
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:21,560
is you have to go to something that's called certifications.

413
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:27,032
The next milestone is on the 20th, which is-- like, it's very ominously called, like, beta

414
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:31,370
which is supposed to be TRC complete, uh, essentially for Sony

415
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,039
so there's a lot of stuff that needs to happen before that.

416
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:38,777
Those are all the requirements you need for shipping a game on a--on a Sony platform.

417
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,012
Schafer: I'm sure we're TRC complete.

418
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,214
Franzke: Oh, yeah, no problem.

419
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:48,754
Um, so they will essentially, like, run a game and make sure that every one of those requirements is met.

420
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:53,425
[Offscreen] How does stuff like Assassin's Creed happen?

421
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,195
Oliver: Uh, I'd rather not comment on that.

422
00:24:56,195 --> 00:25:00,399
It's really sad, because I'm pretty sure all the people who worked on the game, you know,

423
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,736
didn't want to release something that's substandard.

424
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:08,273
Um, so very often, it's--it's-- actually really sad for the developers,

425
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:12,678
but there's a lot of, like, pressure from various departments

426
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,647
to make the game happen essentially.

427
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,117
Are you feeling some form of pressure like that now?

428
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:23,088
Well, I mean, but if you-- if you don't have a publisher who's, like, does what, uh, needs to happen,

429
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:29,228
but as you can see, everything is so tightly packed, uh, that there's really no time to slip any of those milestones.

430
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,832
Franzke: Yes, please. -Okay.

431
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,267
See, crunch has already started.

432
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:38,404
Schafer: Yeah, we're getting near the end where some nights people are working late

433
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:41,874
and we're ordering food, and, um...

434
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,777
and hopefully that won't be too long till it's over.

435
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:47,813
And people who are staying late now, it's 'cause they want to make sure the game is really good.

436
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:59,324
[Music] I know the biggest hurdle is just the amount

437
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,193
of work there is to do.

438
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:04,830
Uh, we have to do a whole bunch of cut scenes.

439
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,098
Still have to go in.

440
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:10,269
Crook: Camden there was the issue with, uh, Bob Chothra coming out of the mountain

441
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:13,872
that we were gonna-- did you talk to Tim about that and Peter?

442
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,041
I don't know about-- I'm in that scene still.

443
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:19,244
We're making some changes, so I just-- Stoddard: Okay.

444
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,013
Schafer: Just saying that gave Ray a headache.

445
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:24,249
Offscreen: How is the ending cut scene coming along, since that was sort of, uh-- that had to be--

446
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,151
the music had to be done, so that was kind of locked.

447
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:30,389
Schafer: Yeah, yeah, 'cause we kind of locked it, but I feel good about the pacing of that, just based on the music.

448
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:35,594
Um, and it was so big we had to split it between two animators, Miyuki and Chris Lam.

449
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,864
So Miyuki was doing the first half and Chris was doing the second half.

450
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:41,333
And then we're gonna stitch it back together.

451
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,534
Oh, I like that. That's a good idea.

452
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:43,569
Crook: Yeah, that was really good.

453
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:45,003
That's cute.

454
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:52,010
Richardson: Like, uh, so many characters, and...

455
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,145
and it's kind of a big thing, right?

456
00:26:53,145 --> 00:27:00,385
It's ending, end of the game, so that's kind of exciting, but still goin' like,

457
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:04,690
"Ooh, that's a lot of things to do." Crook: Maybe not the happy eyes? Lam: No.

458
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:09,394
Schafer: Yeah, like, the delirious eyes, like yay, he's more like...

459
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,230
Hm.

460
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,700
"You run, I got this." Crook: All right. Schafer: "Save yourself."

461
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,468
Thumb's up.

462
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,505
Crook: Yeah, he got that on film. We might need to...

463
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,773
Schafer: This ping pong ball, his face.

464
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:26,845
Lam: The parts that I have to do that are kind of those, you know, resolution moments,

465
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:32,317
they're gonna be a little challenging but-- to get the expressions on the characters right

466
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:37,055
so that you know that they're thinking, they're not just staring into dead space and stuff like that.

467
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,790
Crook: Think you got enough info there?

468
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,825
Okay. Lam: Yes.

469
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:43,595
Crook: The plan is to just take it to that, um, shippable stage.

470
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:49,635
And then, uh, that will allow all the effects and the sound to get put in, um, 'cause all the timing will be locked down.

471
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:53,539
So the--the plan is that they'll go back to it, uh, to do some polish, um,

472
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,073
after we get all the content in.

473
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,742
Schafer: Is this a good time to look at it?

474
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:59,478
It would be a good time to look at it, yes.

475
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:03,048
It doesn't--sometimes it seems like in that whole thing, there's not a shot that shows--

476
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:06,418
that really shows the entire scene.

477
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,854
Schafer: But, I mean, you know what's left and you know what's right.

478
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,556
Crook: Yeah, like, this is the only shot we have.

479
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:15,227
Rice: That's the shot that shows most-- Crook: What--uh, I don't know.

480
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:18,830
I just kept thinking that, like-- You could almost do-- Rice: if it's a flip book,

481
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,166
you could almost--you could have other people that we don't know

482
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,235
that are on the sides from both villages.

483
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:24,870
Crook: All these people, like here.

484
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,705
Schafer: But where do they come from? Crook: Well, they came from...

485
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,075
Rice: From the monster lands town, like, there's a big battle going on.

486
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,843
They've come to gawk.

487
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:37,349
Crook: That's fine. I mean, if you're-- But we--but we can't-- we don't want...

488
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,117
-...to animate more people. Stoddard: Yeah, yeah, I know.

489
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,219
Rice: But that's what you're saying. Schafer: It's really important not to add features to the game

490
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,654
at this point Ray.

491
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,856
I like the melting you're adding.

492
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:47,826
I wouldn't jump to that melting platform.

493
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:48,794
Crook: Yeah, that's true. She has no shoes.

494
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:51,396
Camden: She's tough. She's a baker.

495
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,399
Crook: She walks on coals. Schafer: She doesn't use oven mitts anymore.

496
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,401
Oh, that's good. That's perfect.

497
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,573
So I think this would be-- this needs something here.

498
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:06,445
Inversin: It--it has something, not in this scene, but there is-- I can--I can move it into that scene also if you want.

499
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,347
Schafer: 'Cause it seemed like he was backing up from nothing.

500
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,616
Inversin: So, like, it's in there, too, so I can add it to the other one.

501
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,217
Schafer: I just think it--think it could be, like, half as much?

502
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,619
Crook: That looks really cool.

503
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:16,188
Schafer: It kind of explains why he jumps now.

504
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,557
That's perfect. I think that's perfect as far as the rain goes.

505
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,758
-Awesome. -Yeah.

506
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,792
-Then we're done. -Yeah.

507
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,060
That was easy.

508
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,195
Boop boop. Yeah, that was really good.

509
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,130
Thanks.

510
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,036
Oh, crying for us.

511
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:34,573
Crook: Yeah.

512
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:42,481
[Music] Rice: But we're finally now getting down to-- to final days, I guess.

513
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:54,793
[Music] Crook: But, yeah, we're all a little on edge, a little stressed out,

514
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,262
but, um, it'll be okay.

515
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:03,602
Hansen: Anna's here almost constantly, and, you know, I can-- I see the light at the end of the tunnel.

516
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:08,140
We love these games, but, you know, we all kind of need to take a break.

517
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,075
And people need to get some sleep, too.

518
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:12,711
It's been a rough few months.

519
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:16,615
Crook: I mean, we're gonna be pushing to the very end.

520
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:19,184
[Off screen] Like that guy there. Crook: Oh yeah he is.

521
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,019
I think he didn't go home last night.

522
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,855
But apparently he has, like, a little bed over there.

523
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,425
So I'm just like, that's not a good thing.

524
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,793
Stoddard: I don't want to romanticize it.

525
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:30,729
I know--I know that Tim wants to show how the sausage gets made,

526
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:35,500
and this has been-- this has been hard.

527
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,372
Schafer: We're also getting kind of griefed by, um, certain fringe organizations

528
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:44,476
and attack groups organized, and, uh, that was a bummer.

529
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,611
And then we had the layoffs which were a huge bummer.

530
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:50,649
And, um, a bunch of bad news.

531
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:56,755
Rice: There is, like, a group of people that are hoping that we won't succeed for some weird reason,

532
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:59,858
um, or that are at least heavily scrutinizing us.

533
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,061
And it definitely has been something that's been weighing on a lot of people.

534
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:07,733
Franzke: The endless thing of, like, people, like, oh, well, maybe they shouldn't have taken the--the money

535
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:11,703
and only make half the game. Well, you know, all I can say to that is, like,

536
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:15,841
if you would be, like, we're sitting here, you know, working our asses off to make this game.

537
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,375
Kipnis: And, like, you do, you question yourself.

538
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,812
Like, yeah, maybe we-- what the fuck, maybe we don't know what the--what we're doing.

539
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,514
Who knows?

540
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:25,383
But you just have to trust and know, like, this is actually-- game development

541
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,486
is not an easy thing.

542
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:30,856
Schafer: And now we're gonna ship Broken Age, and that's all gonna be great.

543
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:35,060
So, um, it's a relief to get out of that-- out of that period.

544
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,134
[Offscreen] What's going on right now at this stage of the project?

545
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:46,271
Romero: So where we are is, we're less than a month out from our first submission,

546
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:50,675
which is the, um, where you submit to Sony and we release the mastering for the PC,

547
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,844
physical copies that we're doing with Nordic.

548
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:58,083
So the 20th is the big day where just everything has to sort of be done by that point.

549
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:03,789
Rice: Uh, yes, I've been working on some Nordic stuff, too, along with Vic. Um... We got the box prints

550
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:07,092
from them and they just look a little bit dark so we're doing, like, another round on those

551
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,694
before they actually start printing them in bulk.

552
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,596
Uh, but hopefully that'll happen soon.

553
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,332
Schafer: But we don't get a sample before they make a zillion of them?

554
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,134
Rice: No, unfortunately. Schafer: Exciting.

555
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,169
Rice: Yeah. Schafer: That's exciting.

556
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:19,304
This is just one of Cory's mock-ups of the box.

557
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,006
This is the box.

558
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,674
This is--the disc's not gonna look like that.

559
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,576
I wanted the disc to be the O from Broken Age.

560
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,245
This is gonna be like the O, and that's the box.

561
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:31,483
And we're first looking at it, we're like, this is cool 'cause it shows the split thing,

562
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:36,621
but it really overemphasizes Vella over Shay, 'cause Shay's upside down so he's, like, easier to ignore.

563
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,090
It was like, wouldn't it be crazy if we could print Vella and Shay

564
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,527
on a separate clear slipcover, and then you could slide it off

565
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:46,731
and turn it around and slide it back down and then Shay would be in Vella's world and vice versa,

566
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:50,335
Which, no spoilers, but that's some foreshadowing there.

567
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,403
And it would be so neat.

568
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:52,771
It would be like Led Zeppelin.

569
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:53,872
Rice: We'll nail it. It'll be great.

570
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,074
-Um... Kipnis: Wow.

571
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:03,615
Romero: So right now the big tasks are-- or the big areas are bugs.

572
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:07,185
O'Rourke: Yeah, we're in Starship Troopers mode basically, just killing all the bugs.

573
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:10,689
Schafer: Taking showers together or what are you-- Coull: No. Schafer: I'm sorry, that's...

574
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:11,857
not the first thing I think about.

575
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:16,294
O'Rouke: There's the daily shower scene in the audio room.

576
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:19,164
Kipnis: I'm a little bit concerned about our deadline.

577
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,100
Like, right here it says A and B bugs only.

578
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,537
Like, that's not likely gonna happen, especially since we have brand new cut scenes.

579
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:26,605
Schafer: Starting now or next week?

580
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:27,672
Kipnis: Next week.

581
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:32,677
Uh, that's likely not happening because we have a bunch of new, um, cut scenes coming.

582
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:38,016
Content is still coming in and we can't actually do that until all content is in the game.

583
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,551
Schafer: What's this selective bug fixing?

584
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:43,755
Almost sounds more open-ended than A and B 'cause we select to do a C.

585
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,056
Right, that's how that works?

586
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,625
Kipnis: Nope. Rice: I don't think so.

587
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:49,794
Kipnis: But if you play the game all the way through, um, from Act 1,

588
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:54,165
that Act 1 is very clean, and we have to make Act 2 look that clean,

589
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,668
and that's a lot of C-bug fixing.

590
00:33:56,668 --> 00:34:00,105
And so, like, we can't suddenly switch to A and Bs only next week.

591
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:04,309
Like, it's just not-- it's gonna be basically like a, I don't know,

592
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:07,312
not a very clean game, I guess.

593
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:12,583
Romero: Uh, Act 2 is interesting because we're not just doing PC, Mac, and Linux digital,

594
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:16,755
um, we're doing physical, when--and really that goes back to the old school way,

595
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:21,226
which is you get to the point in the project where you're gonna ship a physical disc,

596
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,527
you have to cut off bug fixing.

597
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:25,496
You have to be certain that the build you're shipping is the one,

598
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:29,868
because someone's gonna, in theory, buy the box and get the game,

599
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:34,806
and that has to have all the, you know, be bug-free as-- as bug-free as possible and as solid as possible,

600
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:38,109
so they'll just have the disc and the game that's on there.

601
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,444
That's it.

602
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:42,746
Kipnis: I don't have confidence at the moment that we have--we're really

603
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:45,349
at the bug count that we are.

604
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:49,554
Or, like, I--I expect that the bugs will increase tremendously,

605
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,690
or should, because I think they are in there.

606
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,358
Romero: They're still there. Kipnis: Yeah.

607
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,360
Franzke: It's still gonna be good, like, I mean, this game has been out for such a long time, I think

608
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,431
it's gonna be stable and it's gonna be good, but there's always, like,

609
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:04,202
so much more that we would have liked to do and, like, we're now at a point where

610
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,503
that's just not gonna be possible.

611
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:08,773
We need to, you know, make sure that the game is stable.

612
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:12,644
You know, you look-- you look at your bug database and you list some issues that you have in there

613
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:16,781
and it's, like, a lot, and it's like, how are we gonna be able to--to finish that?

614
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:28,560
We'll have to probably do some bug triaging next week to just see kind of, okay, well, all of these issues

615
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,765
that are in the bug database right now, which one are we realistically gonna be able to even do now?

616
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:37,202
And then they have to-- there will have to be some hard decisions.

617
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:41,606
It's like, okay, well, we can only do one or the other, so which one of these issues,

618
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,808
polish items is more important to you?

619
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:46,811
And then we're gonna do that but not the other.

620
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,147
And it's just the nature of the beast.

621
00:35:49,640 --> 00:36:07,198
[Music] Hansen: Resources in 12. Schafer: That would be great.

622
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:11,136
Uh, and yeah, we'll have to re-- and I mean, obviously,

623
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,638
analyze the bugs every day and how they're tracking.

624
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,407
Are all the GPs back from sickness?

625
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,175
Hansen: No, Anna's still out. Stoddard: Two down.

626
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,810
Hansen: But-- Schafer: She's gonna be out today, too?

627
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,779
Hansen: She's trying to get some medicine that'll allow her to work this week,

628
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,414
so she's that bad.

629
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:23,715
Schafer: Holy cow.

630
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,418
Crook: She was working really late hours.

631
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:28,853
I think she was probably-- Her immune system was already

632
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:35,126
pretty vulnerable, and, um, and she--she got whatever, I don't know.

633
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,528
I hope--I don't know, she hasn't said.

634
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:37,796
She went to the doctor.

635
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:41,032
Hopefully it's not pneumonia or something, but, um,

636
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,634
hopefully she'll be back with us on Monday.

637
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:46,838
But--but we know that the most important thing for her is just to get better.

638
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,074
You know, it's just a video game.

639
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:52,811
You know, she's, you know, her health is the most important thing,

640
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:56,314
so, um, so that's why it's been great.

641
00:36:56,314 --> 00:37:00,852
Everyone has just jumped in to try and help out, and nobody blames anybody for anything.

642
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:06,157
-It's just one of those things. Boehle: I'll probably just filter, like, Anna's open or new bugs, like, priority two and higher,

643
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,993
and then if there's anything UI related, I'll just grab those and--

644
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,728
Franzke: Right. Yeah, I think we have to.

645
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:14,432
I mean, it's just kind of-- sounds like Anna's hit pretty hard.

646
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:17,769
Hansen: But it's still difficult because, you know, there's a lot of ownership over the code,

647
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:22,607
so Anna will be able to get something done a lot faster than anybody else just 'cause she's so familiar

648
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,843
with all the inner workings of how this stuff is all hooked up.

649
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:28,012
That makes it more difficult, for sure, 'cause all the pressure's on her right now.

650
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:31,182
Rice: I guess at least through the week and then, I just--I guess I wonder when we're gonna get

651
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:34,719
to other platform work, but for now it's obvious.

652
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,287
It seems like this is until we're locking stuff down.

653
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,724
Franzke: I mean, like, whenever there's an actual pre-cert issue coming in from Sony,

654
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,861
I'm jumping on it right away because I want to get them,

655
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:44,129
like, fixed as soon as possible.

656
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:45,430
But so far it's been pretty good.

657
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,000
I think actually not that many bugs been reported from pre-certs.

658
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,136
Rice: So, yeah, whathaveibeenworkingon? We have a couple things.

659
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:54,706
Today we set up a bug triage meeting with all of the leads.

660
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:59,344
So, um, producers and leads and Tim, are gonna kind of read through everything in the bug database,

661
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:01,813
reevaluating where we are with that.

662
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:03,748
So that'll be happening this afternoon.

663
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,784
Schafer: Hey, everybody, hello. Rice: Hi.

664
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,387
Schafer: This is probably the last meeting of the project, right?

665
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,788
Rice: Um... Probably not.

666
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,590
Schafer: We're so close. Rice: Big one, though.

667
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,794
Rice: It's a big one. Franzke: Apart from the meeting where we get all the royalty checks?

668
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,228
Schafer: Yeah, that's after. That's after.

669
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,497
We have to ship it first, Oliver.

670
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:23,801
But yeah, so we're gonna look over the bug database and see if we can get rid of some bugs.

671
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:28,106
Rice: I think the hope is really just trying to get an idea of which ones we definitely need to fix

672
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:29,841
and which ones might be okay to drop.

673
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:37,315
And this is specifically for the date in two weeks from now, which is like pressing it to the disc for PC.

674
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:43,621
So I guess it's, like, what are we gonna not feel comfortable having fixed before that disc is pressed.

675
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,023
And how bad is the situation right now?

676
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:47,225
'Cause I'm hearing things like the bugs aren't gonna be fixed

677
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:48,393
by the ship date and all that.

678
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:52,197
I mean, from Vic's last email, it sounds like we're tracking about half the speed

679
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:55,300
um, that we would need to be for fixing these 250.

680
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:00,805
Um, I guess it's just, like, what's the line we can draw where we're comfortable that it's a solid build

681
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,541
that's not gonna crash that gives a good experience.

682
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,844
And, yeah, maybe there's, like, some polish stuff that would have been nice to be in there

683
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:11,049
but at least it's in versions that get patched.

684
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:14,052
Hansen: I mean, every game that ships ships with bugs, period.

685
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,753
They're--I mean, it's just unavoidable.

686
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,422
You can keep testing a game forever.

687
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,757
It's just you have to get to the point where you feel like

688
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:23,995
you found things that are-- you know, that most people are likely to run into

689
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,530
and you've addressed all that stuff.

690
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,132
Rice: Then, like, there's certain cut scenes when you interact with things

691
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,401
in the spinning mode where she'll then just not be spinning

692
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,503
all of a sudden and talking, then it'll go back into

693
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:36,207
spinning, like-- Schafer: I haven't seen that. Rice: You haven't seen that?

694
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,676
Schafer: Okay, we should find those. Rice: I just saw it, like, last night, so...

695
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:39,811
Crook: Oh, okay.

696
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:42,113
Schafer: What stretching arms show?

697
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:44,515
Crook: When, the wakeup scene? Schafer: Mm-hm.

698
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:48,286
Crook: The arm--It happens twice, when it grabs him and then you can see at the very top,

699
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:50,855
you can see, like, the arms are all wacky.

700
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,724
Like they're all stretched out and weird.

701
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,692
Schafer: Is it really ugly? Romero: Is that...?

702
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,729
Rice: I think I've seen it. It's like the top point is off the side and then where they come in.

703
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:00,832
Schafer: If you were a player, would you say that's the science fiction, uh...

704
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:03,134
Crook: It's a sliver of, like, pulled out stuff.

705
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:08,506
Franzke: It is a potentially really risky fix, though, because touching-- Getting that camera to work right in that scene

706
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,542
was--we spent weeks-- Schafer: It's not just reposing the hand?

707
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:16,080
Franzke: Right. And I really would not feel comfortable messing with the cameras unless we really have to because...

708
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,149
Schafer: Would you fix it with the camera or fix it with the animation?

709
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:21,252
Crook: We can try and change up the animation-- Schafer: But you can't just straighten up the arm.

710
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,155
Crook: That's a scary scene. Schafer: Hm.

711
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:29,160
Crook: We are trying to take things that maybe-- small things that we normally might ask

712
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,831
the game play programmers to do, uh, we're trying to fix those things ourselves

713
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:36,134
just because they're so swamped.

714
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:38,836
But we're not programmers and we have to be careful.

715
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:40,305
We don't want to break things.

716
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,140
So I'm kind of learning a lot of things.

717
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,376
Um, I'm learning a few things about game play programming.

718
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:50,448
Schafer: What if Ben Peck is super miserable at his new job? Has anyone called him lately?

719
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,817
Crook: I saw--I saw him at GDC. He looked a little miserable.

720
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,586
Schafer: Yeah, see what I'm saying? Crook: That was only 'cause Anna was giving him mean looks.

721
00:40:57,255 --> 00:41:00,658
Franzke: I saw him on Friday and he seemed relatively happy.

722
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,794
Schafer: Wait, can we see how many of these we have to go through?

723
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:06,164
Romero: Uh, so we're at 155.

724
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:08,733
The bottom goes all the way to 252.

725
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:10,201
So we're about a hundred away.

726
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,738
Schafer: Oh, my God.

727
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:20,144
Hansen: We don't have a lot of time in general, so yeah, in aggregate, all that stuff is a lot of work.

728
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:26,050
'Cause what we're trying to do is, like, get to a point where we've addressed everything we're gonna address

729
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,520
and then have the game sit without anybody working on it.

730
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,157
Just--it's just sitting just in QA for, like, a week.

731
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,260
And that's the hard part 'cause we-- we've already eaten into that week.

732
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,865
And so we're kind of faced with the decision now of, like, do we just work up to the deadline

733
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:42,600
and just ship what we have?

734
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,335
And there's a huge risk involved with that.

735
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,672
But even, like, the small, minor polish bugs, it's like, you get enough of those

736
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,408
and it does make a huge impact on the quality of the game.

737
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:52,643
Schafer: Yeah, it looks really bad.

738
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:56,714
Um, when we print this disc, how would people get the patch?

739
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,116
Franzke: Steam.

740
00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:00,551
Schafer: So that's the only way to get the patch for their disc-based version

741
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,719
of the game is by using Steam?

742
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:04,789
Franzke: Yeah. Schafer: They can't download it from our website or anything like that?

743
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:07,058
Franzke: Our infrastructure--like, we would require to have

744
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:10,828
some kind of login service for people to register accounts.

745
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:16,701
Schafer: That could be a huge consumer thing of them saying I need to--

746
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,670
in order to get the patch, I need to join Steam, and I don't want to join Steam.

747
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,105
I bought this disc. Franzke: Yeah.

748
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:25,510
Schafer: So it's not like in the old days, where a patch was just a bunch of LUA files

749
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:29,046
that you could just unpack into the directory of your game and it would fix it?

750
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,617
Franzke: We could, but we have no infrastructure for that right now.

751
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:34,385
Schafer: On the server side or in the game?

752
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:39,624
In the game would have to have that kind of-- Franzke: We right now have no software to create an incremental patch.

753
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,797
Schafer: People are gonna freak out.

754
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:48,666
Rice: Yeah, well, we don't want to have to support a whole 'nother platform.

755
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,869
And, like, it would mean, like, building ground up an infrastructure

756
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:54,705
for them to be able to sign in to something.

757
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:57,875
For us to be able to host something, for us to support a whole 'nother platform.

758
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,312
Schafer: Well, I just think the other stuff is-- like, just 'cause it's hard for us doesn't mean

759
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,080
we're not gonna have to deal with it as a company.

760
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,850
You know what I mean? Like, as a huge community or PR problem.

761
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:10,988
Rice: This was a red flag waved as soon as we said we were gonna do a box copy.

762
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:14,325
Franzke: Right, I mean, that's one of the first things we talked about is how the patching would work.

763
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:19,030
Rice: Yeah, well, we can handle it case-by-case and give them a DRM free code whenever we have to

764
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:22,733
for GOG or whatever if you think people care that much about DRM.

765
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,404
Schafer: I mean, probably be they wouldn't notice all these things like a flicking shadow or something under the seat.

766
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:32,410
But it's just that people who buy DRM free copies of games are like, "I'm not signing on to anything.

767
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,714
I don't want to sign on to Steam." Rice: Right. Franzke: They hate--they hate Steam.

768
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:39,684
Schafer: And they were loud about that until we made the DRM free version of the game,

769
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:42,587
the first game, so...

770
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:44,856
And then what happens if we ship late to Nordic?

771
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:47,125
What does Nordic do if we ship late to them?

772
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,394
Rice: Uh, the disc is late, then all the dates shift.

773
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,562
Schafer: And then what happens?

774
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:53,631
Rice: Then all the dates shift.

775
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,832
Schafer: And then what happens.

776
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:59,770
Rice: Tell Sony and Justin's mad, and, yeah.

777
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:06,377
Rice: Yeah? I'm just trying to balance that out like how bad it would be if-- okay, anyway.

778
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,445
Maybe they wouldn't notice issues.

779
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:10,014
Rice: This is why we never wanted to sim ship a disc.

780
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:12,250
This is why we wanted to, like, have the game out there,

781
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:16,387
have it be patched and finished before we did. So as soon as we signed a contract to sim ship,

782
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:19,824
we knew it would mean either finishing it all and having this period

783
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:23,494
or having a build on a disc that wasn't fully patched.

784
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,664
Schafer: Say we slipped the disc date by two weeks.

785
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,401
Does that mean moving that revenue out of the plan for two weeks is Justin's problem

786
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:33,838
or that there's something bigger with Nordic where they have a truck idling

787
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,439
in the loading dock for two weeks?

788
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,642
Rice: It's that. They want us to right now announce a date.

789
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:39,076
And Sony wants us to commit to a date.

790
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,545
Everyone wants us to commit to a date.

791
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:43,347
We've been holding it off because of all these moving pieces.

792
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,250
Schafer: But it sounds like we already are committed to a date if we're saying we can't slip it.

793
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,487
Rice: We haven't totally, but we should and that's what he wants to know.

794
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:52,056
Schafer: Why don't we just move it two weeks and then commit to it?

795
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:53,357
Rice: 'Cause I don't know that Justin can.

796
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,194
They've been talking-- so there's, like, million pieces in place.

797
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,762
Schafer: Like, these are all the ones we know about.

798
00:44:57,762 --> 00:45:01,299
I'm talking about there's a bug that we ship on the disc that is, like every--

799
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:03,267
it's like the elevator, Manny locked in the elevator bug.

800
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:06,837
Rice: Okay. Schafer: Everyone's posting vines about it all over, it's all over Twitter the next day.

801
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,706
And everyone's like, everyone's freaking out about this bug.

802
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:12,743
Say I can't this patch 'cause I bought the disc, or I was dumb enough to buy the disc version.

803
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:17,648
You know, and it's just like we're ripping off everybody and that's the story.

804
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:22,987
And if it's that on one hand or slipping the date by two weeks, I would slip the date by two weeks.

805
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:25,456
But I want to know what's the consequence of that?

806
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:26,824
Rice: Yeah, we'll talk about it after.

807
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,726
Schafer: Yeah.

808
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,297
Romero: Uh, all right, almost to the forest.

809
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:34,832
Let's see.

810
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:37,368
Rice: That was the first thing I thought when we had that conversation.

811
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:39,837
I was like, oh, is there wiggle room in their production schedule

812
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,872
for, uh, the box?

813
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:45,376
And I looked, and no, their drop dead is, like, the 24th.

814
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:49,146
And that's why they wanted it on the 20th so they could, like, prepare everything.

815
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:56,120
Uh, so it would mean pushing the box date out, which I think, since it would be our fault for delivering a build later

816
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,855
that we'd have to push everything.

817
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:02,727
'Cause I think, like, if we delivered the build on time and they were the reason that the box showed up late,

818
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:05,196
then we could have shipped and not have it sim shipped.

819
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:07,999
But, um, yeah, we have to sim ship with them.

820
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:14,038
Uh, so, yeah, it would mean, um, moving all the other stuff, which is possible.

821
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:18,042
It just is, like, going back to everybody and making sure that they're okay with it.

822
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:21,212
And especially since Anna's been out all week, it's made it even trickier.

823
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:25,650
We've got, like, all the other programmers piling on now to try and help out.

824
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:32,156
So that's helping, but, yeah, I mean, I guess we're still gonna end up with looking like

825
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:35,826
at least another week or two of game play bugs.

826
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:39,330
There's just also this unknown question of, like, is there a big bug that we're missing

827
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,765
that we don't know about?

828
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:46,404
I think that Tim is a little bit worried about, like, our patching solution on the disc, too,

829
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:51,609
and even if that's, like, um, gonna be well met by customers.

830
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:54,278
Yeah, I guess the question is whether we are gonna be okay with

831
00:46:54,278 --> 00:47:02,086
now rolling out to all of our partners and potentially having to move it back a week or two.

832
00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:04,121
Bailey: Yeah, I mean, that's problematic.

833
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:07,858
We--it's in our best interests to stick to the April 28th date.

834
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:14,031
Rice: Mm-hm. Bailey: So, um, it's just there's not a whole lot of wiggle room left.

835
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:19,370
Rice: Yeah. Hansen: Yeah, he's trying to-- he's trying to lay out the whole thing to Justin.

836
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:23,708
I mean, honestly, what we've got to do is present options for Justin.

837
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:25,676
You know, there's pros and cons for each one of them, right?

838
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,879
And it's--we need to make a business decision on this.

839
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:35,319
Bailey: Because it's a double hit for us to, like, take on more expense for Broken Age to go a week longer.

840
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:38,255
But then also not to have the money that's being brought in, so...

841
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:43,694
Hansen: You know, Tim's already made his decision, but, you know, Justin needs to weigh in on it also

842
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,263
because there's a lot at stake for this, so...

843
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:51,102
There's ramifications of all these decisions, but, I mean, we want to push for the one that's gonna give

844
00:47:51,102 --> 00:47:53,170
the highest quality game at the end.

845
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:59,110
Rice: Yeah, the question is whether we can maybe just push the date back of starting burning all of those discs

846
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:03,013
and still make the 28th, because the rest of it actually looks like

847
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:10,154
it's kinda on track for the 28th as far as digital release across all of our other platforms.

848
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:13,090
So I don't think that really affects the digital dates.

849
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:17,394
Hansen: One week of bug fixing and then one week of-- you know, nobody's touching the build.

850
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,796
Rice: Yeah, exactly. Hansen: It's just in QA.

851
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:24,435
Rice: If we can go to them and see if they can move their date for manufacturing back and not touch the final date,

852
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:26,003
then that seems like it should be good.

853
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:28,873
Bailey: Okay. I mean hearing this, you know, you're probably right.

854
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:31,008
Let's just go ahead and, um...

855
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:36,614
I think it'd be good to maybe just even get a call and just get all the major stakeholders on the line at once

856
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:40,484
and then we can talk about what the date's looking like and then talk about some stuff

857
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:43,854
that we can give as well and figure it out.

858
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:47,758
Hansen: I almost don't want to, like-- the way we phrase this is kind of important 'cause we don't want to, like,

859
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,794
ask them as much as like, we have to do this.

860
00:48:49,794 --> 00:48:51,695
I don't see an alternative, so. Bailey: We're just telling them.

861
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:54,598
Hansen: About getting them onboard. Bailey: We're like, "Hey, we're in the production, you know,

862
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,735
so we're definitely not gonna make the five weeks that's, you know, ideal for you guys.

863
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:58,736
Hansen: Yeah.

864
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:16,520
[Music] Um, so I guess we can start any time,

865
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,322
uh, any time you want.

866
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:20,825
Bailey: Um, are you guys okay-- we have our camera crew.

867
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:22,827
They want to film this for the documentary.

868
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:28,799
So are you guys okay with being on camera, or your voices being on tape?

869
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,434
Nordic Rep: Sure.

870
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:35,406
Bailey: The bad news is that we had about a five week, um...

871
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:39,310
On your production schedule, it had five weeks out when we actually gave you guys the build,

872
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:44,682
like, for us to actually get the build to you, and for you then to be able to get this pressed.

873
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:50,221
So with the bugs and other things we're running up against now, it looks like--

874
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:53,324
I don't know if we're gonna need to go right up against that deadline,

875
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:57,495
but we're gonna need more time than the five weeks we planned for

876
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,763
in that schedule you guys sent over.

877
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:04,235
Rice: I think the date we know we'd be confident at having a stable build ready for you to press disc

878
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:06,070
is April third.

879
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:10,441
So, yeah, I guess that's where the question comes in is if there's a little bit more wiggle room on your guys' side

880
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:15,212
to try and push back that disc pressing date a little bit.

881
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:18,382
Nordic Rep: So you're saying April third would be ready to replicate, right?

882
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:19,650
Rice: Yeah.

883
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:28,759
Nordic Rep: Well, I mean, that would give us enough time for an April 28th release.

884
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:29,793
Bailey: Good. Rice: Cool.

885
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:31,795
That's what we were hoping.

886
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,397
Bailey: Yay. All right.

887
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,766
Rice: Okay. So, yeah, I guess we just didn't know if there was, like, buffer

888
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:39,470
built into that schedule or not.

889
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:43,374
Nordic Rep: I mean, it's tight, you know.

890
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:46,043
Rice: Sounds great. Hansen: That'd be awesome.

891
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,646
Nordic Rep: But let me--you know, if we can--you know, if that's a reliable date,

892
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:53,017
if April 3 is reliable, you know, then I'm cool with it, you know.

893
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:58,756
If we actually do have a master going into replication on April 4,

894
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,824
you know, that works for us.

895
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,826
-Okay. -But there's no-- I mean there's absolutely

896
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:04,795
no buffer in there anymore.

897
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,264
Rice: That's what we figured, but that sounds great.

898
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:10,000
I mean, I think the team's gonna be excited about that for sure.

899
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,704
Bailey: And having you guys in here as well, you know, this could be probably the biggest launch

900
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,706
I think Double Fine's ever done.

901
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:17,875
Nordic Rep: Very good. Bailey: Yeah.

902
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:18,809
Exciting time.

903
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,878
Rice: So April 28th.

904
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:22,513
Hansen: Yep, April 28th.

905
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:23,881
Bailey: Awesome. Nordic Rep: All right.

906
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:28,252
Hansen: Yeah, yeah, it's-- we would-- basically it would be pencils down on the 27th.

907
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,754
Rice: Cool. Hansen: And then we'd just-- it just cooks in QA after that.

908
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,223
Rice: Right. Hansen: That should be really good.

909
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:35,826
We'll have a really solid build at that point.

910
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:38,095
Rice: Cool. I mean, it seems like best case scenario.

911
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:41,098
I didn't think they were gonna be so easy to move.

912
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,700
It's 'cause they had that buffer, waiting.

913
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,301
Bailey: I think the camera helped.

914
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,136
The camera probably did help.

915
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:48,806
Bailey: Thanks, 2 Player! Hansen: Yeah.

916
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:50,507
Schafer: Okay.

917
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:53,444
So I heard that I could add a character.

918
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,546
Yeah, okay. No, that's awesome.

919
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:57,881
Hansen: Maybe....two characters? Schafer: That's really good news.

920
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:04,555
I did not want to go into this knowing that we'd have to ship depending on a day one patch for basic stability.

921
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:06,991
So that's much better. That's awesome. Thank you.

922
00:52:06,991 --> 00:52:11,795
Hansen: So this week's really important. So we need to make sure the team remains focused and we are reviewing the bugs constantly.

923
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,797
Rice: Sweet.

924
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,766
Cool, and Nordic's gonna be putting testers on it, too,

925
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:17,434
looking at German.

926
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:19,269
Perfect. Coull: So, um, yeah.

927
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,271
Rice: Awesome. Sounds good.

928
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:23,440
Almost there, man. Almost there.

929
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:26,777
-I know.

930
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,416
Hopefully everyone will make one more week...

931
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:33,617
-...and we'll be, uh... -All right.

932
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:36,754
She's in. She's in right now.

933
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:37,788
Yeah, she just got here.

934
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:38,789
We should go talk to her.

935
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,026
Hi Anna. Kipnis: Hi.

936
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:43,260
Rice: Are you feeling better?

937
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,628
Kipnis: A little bit.

938
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:47,364
Rice: But they could turn around in three weeks they said, so --

939
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:50,434
If it got to where we had to move it to the third, we probably could.

940
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:52,569
Yeah.

941
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:54,605
Kipnis: Well...

942
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:56,106
Rice: Well, I'm glad you're feeling better.

943
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:57,141
Kipnis: Yeah.

944
00:52:57,141 --> 00:53:00,177
That was the worst week to have missed of work.

945
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,646
I mean, of all the times to get sick.

946
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:06,884
I would get emails every once in a while where I was like, fuck.

947
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:11,789
Well, I felt like I was letting the team down, but that the game wasn't gonna go in the toilet

948
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:14,258
or anything while I was out so...

949
00:53:14,258 --> 00:53:17,194
Yeah, I mean, it's nice to really trust your colleagues.

950
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:21,265
That's a good feeling that they actually, like, took the time to do it and stuff.

951
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:24,835
That's, I don't know, that's great, too, so.

952
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:30,340
Hey, I'm still not a hundred percent right now, but, um, I--I feel confident

953
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:35,846
that we'll-- you know, we'll make it, especially with the little bit of extra time that we got.

954
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:38,048
Rice: Sounds good.

955
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,283
Crook: Okay. Rice: Good plan.

956
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:50,060
Boop, boop, boop.

957
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:55,065
Yay!

958
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:39,143
[Music] Crook: Yeah. Yeah, I'm just excited to be done, uh, soon.

959
00:54:39,143 --> 00:54:41,345
Three years.

960
00:54:41,345 --> 00:54:42,746
Kipnis: Yeah, it, uh, it's great.

961
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,481
It feels weird.

962
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,416
It feels weird that it's almost done.

963
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,885
It's the strangest thing.

964
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:49,419
Franzke: Yeah, it is kind of weird.

965
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:53,624
It's kind of weird to-- Well, it's kind of weird that it took three years.

966
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:57,394
I don't think--I don't think we kind of thought in the beginning it would take that long.

967
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:31,628
[Music] Schafer: Well, you know, three years is not that long for a game.

968
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,798
People will laugh at that, but Brutal was four years.

969
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:38,435
Grim-- I mean Psychonauts was five years.

970
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:45,442
Grim was three years, so it's the same amount of time as Grim with a smaller team and less crunch mode.

971
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:49,613
Grim was really, like, six years if you count all the evenings that we worked.

972
00:55:49,613 --> 00:55:55,752
Um, but it's weird--it's weird to look at the old episodes and just think about how long we've been working on this

973
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,788
and how different it felt in the beginning.

974
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:11,868
[Music] Look, Broken Age alumni.

975
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,538
We're wrapping it up. We're remembering the old people like Levi.

976
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:15,706
Ryken: Hi, everybody.

977
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,541
Rice: We miss you.

978
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:21,879
Schafer: Hello, everybody. Can you remind us, Greg, where we are, what's the schedule, and what will be happening now?

979
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:26,550
Rice: So the next thing is locking down the build, which is happening at the end of the week.

980
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:34,858
Franzke: So really, it's not actually all that super glamorous, but essentially what you can see is all these files here

981
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:37,661
that have the exclamation mark on it.

982
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:45,669
And what that means is that these files are different from the version of the file that's already in that branch.

983
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:51,074
So that's the release candidate branch and so I just say accept this and it will say okay.

984
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,878
That means I will overwrite all your files that you have right now

985
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:57,848
and then just let Perforce do its thing.

986
00:56:57,848 --> 00:57:03,720
Have the little guy walking, which is still my favorite-- one of my favorite icons in terms of tools.

987
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:11,194
This is really a lot of programming, and especially release engineering

988
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:18,802
is just sitting around waiting for files to be copied and for certain operations to be performed on files,

989
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:22,406
which is just kind of weird, like one would expect that, you know, shipping a game is, like,

990
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:24,808
super exciting kind of stuff.

991
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:28,278
But really, in the end of a day, it's a lot of copying files from A to B

992
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:32,015
and sitting around waiting for those files to be copied.

993
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:38,822
Um, all right. So now we essentially have, like, all the yellow exclamation marks are gone,

994
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:43,727
which means we now have a list of files, all the files that were changed.

995
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:47,597
And I'm just gonna say, okay, I want to commit these into the release kind of branch,

996
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:51,134
so I'm gonna say integration from main.

997
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:55,505
And this is actually also lock down, so I'm gonna say content lock.

998
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:58,075
Oh, I actually have to spell it correctly.

999
00:57:58,075 --> 00:58:02,679
And then I say submit, and that's essentially it.

1000
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:09,219
So now we grab all the files from the main line and copy them over into the release candidate branch,

1001
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,788
and we lock down the build.

1002
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:16,059
Rice: Right now all the, uh, disc stuff is basically off to Nordic and on their plate,

1003
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,195
so that should actually go into manufacturing this week.

1004
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:20,831
And they said they said they're gonna talk with us for photos

1005
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,866
and gonna update as they go along.

1006
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:27,771
But this should be tracking towards same day launching the disc as the game digitally.

1007
00:58:27,771 --> 00:58:30,173
Schafer: I know what you're saying, why are you wearing luau clothes, Tim?

1008
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:33,510
-Yeah. Rice: Why are you wearing-- -No, it's pretty normal.

1009
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:40,517
Schafer: I am wearing both pants and luau pants because tonight we are going to have a bonfire down at the beach

1010
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,286
to celebrate the completion of Broken Age, everybody.

1011
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:46,857
[Applause] Yay!

1012
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:49,826
He's like, son of a-- about fucking time!

1013
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,495
Yes, okay.

1014
00:58:51,495 --> 00:58:53,330
It's just about done, right, Oliver?

1015
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,031
No way it could ever bounce out of cert now?

1016
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,100
You only have time to eat now during meetings.

1017
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,838
Yeah! Yes!

1018
00:59:02,440 --> 01:00:14,620
