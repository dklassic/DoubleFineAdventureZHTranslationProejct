00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:28,953
[Music] Schafer: You know you got drunk when the next morning

2
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,860
you're just starting to think of things that you said, no.

3
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,973
I have this memory just walking down the street yelling and screaming the entire time.

4
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,740
Schafer: I love Chinatown.

5
00:00:42,880 --> 00:01:19,340
[Music] Schafer: Did you see how many pages I got done?

6
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,560
So far I've got actual writing.

7
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,580
This writing paid for by Kickstarter.

8
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,760
So, it's a book. It's coming along. We came up with a code name.

9
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,840
Do you want to ask questions or should I just start talking?

10
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,120
Rice: DF adventure. Budget.

11
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,900
Schafer: Budget? We need that. We might not need that.

12
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,880
I think we can have food.

13
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,100
Launch event.

14
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,033
I hate to cut the launch event.

15
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,560
That much for PAX Prime really? Rice: Um hm.

16
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,494
Schafer: I mean that, we might not need that.

17
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,300
Let's just say if we're being really bare bones on some of this stuff.

18
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,460
Rice: We're cutting so much stuff right now.

19
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,079
Rice: Ah, it's the things that like...

20
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Schafer: Greg thought of... Everything I thought of is in.

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,212
Everything Greg thought of is out.

22
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:15,681
Rice: Yeah. So I was being really conservative on like trying to figure out stuff outside of just paying the members of the team

23
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:17,180
that we might need to pay for.

24
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,346
And some of that stuff might not be necessary.

25
00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:22,214
So it's...

26
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,480
Schafer: Well, it's tight for me.

27
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,586
I mean, it's tight for me in terms of like the number of people we have on the team.

28
00:02:27,586 --> 00:02:29,806
Like I wish we had more programmers.

29
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,674
So if we did that.

30
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:39,020
So if we cut out all those, some of those things, we'd have like another $100,000, which would be um...

31
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,240
some programmer time.

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,740
Rice: Yeah.

33
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,780
Schafer: OK. All right.

34
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,180
And then we have how long to actually make the production.

35
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,740
'Til next November.

36
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,040
Next November's like infinity far away.

37
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,320
Rice: It's pretty far.

38
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,427
Schafer: We could do eight games in that time. It sounds so long.

39
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,306
Cut to November.

40
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,800
What? The game isn't started yet?

41
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,540
Wait.

42
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,500
Done with that. We're in Alpha, oh.

43
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,633
November this year? Rice: Yeah.

44
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,560
Schafer: We can't do that, it's crazy. That's insane.

45
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,060
We're starting in November next year. Rice: No.

46
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,060
Schafer: That sounds good.

47
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,459
Rice: That would be a year and a half.

48
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,540
Schafer: November this year, oh, that's much closer.

49
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,800
Rice: I mean that gives us uhh...

50
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,540
five, five whole months of production.

51
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,040
Schafer: Five whole months of production?

52
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,980
Oh my God.

53
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,520
Schafer: Well, I'm in an interesting position now because I'm running the company and I'm running a project.

54
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:43,661
So on the one hand I'm just, I'm equal to the other project leaders and I can't really abuse my ability to like pick up resource up

55
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:44,959
and put them on a different project.

56
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,859
But I do when they're not looking, so that's fine.

57
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,640
All for the good of the project.

58
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,900
Team Member: Ostensibly, we going to take somebody off your team to put them on DFA.

59
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,026
And you're going to be short-handed.

60
00:03:58,026 --> 00:04:01,386
Schafer: I mean when you're project leader, you have to kind of fight for your team.

61
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:02,847
I mean, it's a fight for resources.

62
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:08,200
And you care about the company overall but you still know that to make your game good you should get the best people on it.

63
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,733
And so you kind of, you have to do a little recruiting.

64
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,040
You have to talk to them, you know, outside of meetings and stuff and be like, hey, are you interested?

65
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
I think we know you'd be, this would be a good opportunity to you.

66
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,267
You could, you know, you'd be moving up or you'd be taking on more responsibility or we're doing this really cool kind of art or something like that.

67
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:25,587
Get people excited about it.

68
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,393
And mostly we just said that we're doing this project and most people like Anna and Brandon, you know,

69
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,734
mentioned to me they wanted to work on it.

70
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,740
Dillon: I mean I was big gamer when I was a kid.

71
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,106
But like adventure games were always kind of special to me in particular.

72
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:45,593
The fact that I wound up, you know, in a configuration where I could get to work on an adventure game with, you know,

73
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,701
with my favorite adventure game designer.

74
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:50,161
It's just crazy and still kind of mind-boggling.

75
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:58,947
Schafer: And because the schedule is so tight on DFA and it's got such a small budget, that's, that is a bit of worry, too.

76
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,600
Offscreen Voice: Holy shit!

77
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,500
Schafer: I'm nervous, though. Offscreen Voice: Why are you nervous?

78
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,480
Schafer: 'Cause I really want Brandon on the team.

79
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,547
And so do the other teams.

80
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:28,834
So if he does something really awesome, I'm just going to get sad if we then don't get him on the team.

81
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,040
Dillon: So basically over the weekend I just wanted to prototype some tools work.

82
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,640
Schafer: Me, too. I just had, it was Easter.

83
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,320
I didn't get around to it.

84
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,240
Dillon: This is how I celebrate Easter. Schafer: It's beautiful.

85
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,720
Dillon: So I'll show you my super-awesome adventure game here.

86
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,753
Schafer: Oh my God.

87
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,480
Schafer: I didn't know you could draw. Incredible.

88
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,420
Dillon: Yeah, yeah. And I feel like we're basically done.

89
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,993
Schafer: Yeah, we just got to art this up.

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,574
Dillon: And so like I started with the classic data editing thing, which is walk boxes.

91
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,713
And so like got a little, you know, a walk box here.

92
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,680
Schafer: Ah, that's crazy. Dillon: Like look how accurate.

93
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,580
Schafer: Right. Now click on the outer space there. Dillon: It's fine.

94
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,720
Schafer: Let me see this. Let me see this.

95
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,986
Dillon: Oh, you're breaking the illusion.. Schafer: Oh, crash.

96
00:06:15,986 --> 00:06:17,866
It was a really good puzzle.

97
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,600
Brandon is a genius and a great programmer and also someone who has like a deep love,

98
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,640
a deeper understanding of the low level systems required but also a real affinity for adventure games and tools and pipeline.

99
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,940
Dillon: So like this is honestly the stuff that I'm most excited about, right.

100
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:42,633
It's like, you know, coming up with a tool chain for everybody to use, where like, you know, whatever crazy idea that Tim has, we can get it into the game

101
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,707
as quickly as possible and actually see whether or not it works.

102
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:50,000
And tune it up so that it can be as good as it can be.

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,040
I like being behind the scenes.

104
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,160
Schafer: That's crazy, OK. Programming is actually happening, on the game All right, you guys.

105
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,440
Awesome. That's cool. We're actually doing actual work.

106
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,900
Schafer: I Probably should go design it now.

107
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,167
Dillon: It's really nice to just get something on the screen and like that's always the first step to, like it's very clarifying

108
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:20,800
to, you know, have stuff present and actually interactive, because then it's easy to figure out what to do next basically.

109
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,120
Rice: Oliver. Franzke: Hello!

110
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,340
What have you got, man?

111
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,280
Franzke: It's pretty cool.

112
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,000
Rice: This is the game?

113
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,481
Franzke: It's kind of a game. Rice: Oh nice! Walking in 3-D space.

114
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:46,280
Franzke: Well, it's like scaling it vertically, but that's, that's pretty much how we're going to do it in the final game as well.

115
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,520
Rice: So all these are flat planes and you're just scaling the size of the character?

116
00:07:51,980 --> 00:08:00,620
Rice: And then we've got Oliver and he's doing a lot of system work on the engine and getting the engine kind of in shape.

117
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,360
Franzke: Well I was born in Germany of course i'm from Germany.

118
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,266
In fact, from East Germany.

119
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:13,300
So because of historic reasons I can be here today, otherwise I would probably be in Moscow right now, I guess.

120
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:19,640
I'd probably follow the people that work in the industry, like from a young age, you know, I always was playing games and was interested in the medium.

121
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:26,433
It's certainly kind of strange to be here now, to actually write adventure game from scratch.

122
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,500
It's kind of cool, I guess it's what a lot of people in the gaming industry kind of dream about

123
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,980
and would love to do and it's kind of, it's awesome to be here now at this time

124
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,679
and like be able to be part of this project, for sure.

125
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,899
It's very exciting.

126
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:47,080
I should probably mention that this is not the final game, so please nobody freak out at this point yet.

127
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,480
Schafer: You know, I've never worked with Oliver before directly.

128
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,100
He's worked on Once Upon a Monster.

129
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,433
And it's funny, he worked on the special edition of Monkey Island back at Lucas.

130
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,140
Also he's German.

131
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,826
Franzke: And if I have time, which would be awesome, like to actually dialogue system so you can initiate like a dialogue with some...

132
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:09,426
some other thing in the world.

133
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:14,900
Kipnis: So what we're looking at is an implementation of that, of a dialogue sequencer.

134
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,460
We have this database of lines.

135
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,894
So i'm just using that to test out my system.

136
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:26,866
So I wrote this little test dataset that the red bots are going to insult each other with.

137
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,946
And so, yeah, let me show you what it actually looks like when you play it.

138
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,847
My friends had Nintendo and that was, that was the best for me.

139
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:40,507
Like I remember I played a lot of Super Mario Brothers.

140
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:49,200
And I mean, that kind of blew my mind at the time, because when I was growing up I was kind of the oldest kid.

141
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,799
And I would come up with games to play with everyone else to entertain them and stuff.

142
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:01,919
And I realized when I played Super Mario Brothers that this was kind of the same thing.

143
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,626
Like someone made up like this like little world for other people to experience and to see.

144
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:11,387
And you didn't even have to be there; And it was just like magical.

145
00:10:11,387 --> 00:10:15,400
It was like magical technology where I can do this stuff that I had been doing as a child.

146
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,667
That was like my dream. I got my dream job somehow, basically.

147
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:25,161
Schafer: And she, Anna's been implementing my dialogue longer than anybody in the world.

148
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:27,781
What the hell is that sound? [siren in background].

149
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:29,281
That happens every Tuesday at noon.

150
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,720
It's not Tuesday. It is Tuesday.

151
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,320
You know, you hear this robot voice?

152
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,040
Where's the robot voice?

153
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,540
Oh.

154
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,940
[faint distorted voice in background].

155
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,980
You can barely even hear that.

156
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,300
What if that was saying "get out of the building"?

157
00:10:47,307 --> 00:10:48,733
I don't know.

158
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,580
It sounds like, like our government has been shut down.

159
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,413
You are all loyal servants of the...ok so I was saying,

160
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,646
I mean no one's had to implement more of my dialogue ever than Anna, probably because she's been doing it since Psychonauts.

161
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:09,566
And hopefully on this game, I mean she's... I haven't written a lot of dialogue yet, but she already knows kind of what I'm going to write structurally.

162
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:12,146
And so she's already writing the systems to implement that.

163
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,020
Rice: So then we've also got Lee Petty, who is the art director.

164
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,100
Petty: It's kind of hard to tune for unless you have...

165
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,000
Rice: This is the old one and this is the new one.

166
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,566
Petty: That's the old one?

167
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:26,246
Rice: This is the old one, yeah.

168
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:27,340
Petty: That's a little different than I remember it.

169
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,880
Petty: I've pretty much been in the game industry since 1996 constantly.

170
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,620
I was at Accolade for about five years.

171
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,953
I worked on a variety of projects there, some of which shipped, some of which didn't.

172
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,227
I actually was cursed.

173
00:11:39,227 --> 00:11:42,247
I don't remember how many years, but I think it was like my first three years in the industry,

174
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:44,107
everything I worked on was cancelled.

175
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,100
It was like, ahhh.

176
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,666
I can't get a single game on my resume.

177
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:53,186
Luckily games didn't take three years to make each back then, right?

178
00:11:53,186 --> 00:11:54,306
Schafer: Yeah, Lee's been here for a while.

179
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:58,106
He was, came in, in the middle of Brutal Legend and took it over and made it look good.

180
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,520
He's been in the industry for a long time.

181
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,600
I think if you look at him you can see the, it's a wear on his face from the games industry.

182
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,566
No, he's worked on the games for a long time.

183
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:10,726
He knows, he knows everything.

184
00:12:10,726 --> 00:12:12,454
He's, you know, he's run his own projects.

185
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,193
He ran Stacking all by himself. I didn't get involved in that at all.

186
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,580
He wrote the dialogue for it. He did everything.

187
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,420
So we're lucky to have him on projects for a little while.

188
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,960
I'm trying to figure out whether we can steal him for good or not.

189
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,121
But there's so many other things we need him to do.

190
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,680
Don't let him see this footage, though, 'cause he'll ask for a raise.

191
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,880
Rice: Yeah. We're starting to get like a team on the game.

192
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,546
Schafer: This is the nightmare team from hell, you guys.

193
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,800
You've never seen a sicker, crazier team.

194
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:44,233
Petty: I'm getting Wi-Fi but it's not connecting to the Skype.

195
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:45,833
Did you, you signed out on purpose, right?

196
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,700
Rice: Yeah, because it went away.

197
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,000
Petty: Yeah, I don't know what's going on.

198
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,960
Skype server seemed like they're having issues.

199
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,560
Schafer: OK, this is the first stand-up. Isn't it exciting?

200
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,327
We can't do it without Bagel. You can't get Bagel?

201
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,340
Rice: Internet's being weird.

202
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,506
Kipnis: Should we just call him?

203
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,900
Schafer: Bagel, we're having troubles with Skype.

204
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,400
Can we just speaker-phone you in?

205
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,240
Bagel: Yeah, let's do it.

206
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,940
Schafer: OK, we're doing it.

207
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,340
Rice: Is that all the way up?

208
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,507
Schafer: That's as loud as it gets.

209
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:13,787
Say hi, Bagel. Bagel: Hey, everybody.

210
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:19,907
Rice: And then we've also got, we've always had Bagel on, doing like concept arts and backgrounds and stuff like that.

211
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:27,100
But now we've got an art director on the project that'll actually start trying to take those images that Bagel has made

212
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,520
and figure out how to actually get them in a game and get them to be like working game assets.

213
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,754
Schafer: Bagel Stapley, Nathan.

214
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,653
Stapley: Buddy.

215
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,060
Schafer: Look at that baaaaaaa. Lee Petty is here.

216
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,280
Petty: What's up, Bagel?

217
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,780
Schafer: Lee Petoir is here.

218
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:44,166
Stapley: Can you hear me? How is it?

219
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,266
Schafer: Yeah. I can hear you, can you hear me?

220
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:47,266
Stapley: Yeah, I can hear you.

221
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:49,853
Schafer: Oh, man. I haven't paid my property taxes.

222
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,627
So embarrassing.

223
00:13:51,627 --> 00:13:57,300
So one of the main things I want to do is pick what you're going to paint for Lee to mess with in after-effects.

224
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,347
Stapley: Yeah. Schafer: Remember that? Stapley: Yeah.

225
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:02,073
So is that how we're going to do it?

226
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,046
Like I'm thinking of layers basically.

227
00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:08,841
Petty: The goal is just to get like a type of environment, you know.

228
00:14:08,841 --> 00:14:14,234
Like maybe it looks like something that the player could walk, kind of left or right and have it scroll or into.

229
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,140
Kind of either one we could explore.

230
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,080
Schafer: Right now he's taking, you know, Bagel's work and Bagel's not a very technical person

231
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,980
so he just paints these awesome paintings.

232
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,020
But then making it actually look good in the game is a whole different thing.

233
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:34,460
And so we've got Lee working on actually making that a realized game playing world.

234
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,327
And it's really fun to see them working together, because they're so different but they're putting together this, I think,

235
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:41,220
awesome looking visual style.

236
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,760
Schafer: There's a lot of cabins in here.

237
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,660
Petty: Hey, that'd be a good one, Tim. That cabin.

238
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,080
So if you wanted the player walk into the screen there, like it's a little slightly different

239
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,046
but similar to that whole circus sequence in Monkey one.

240
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:58,440
You just walk into that and they can make a move up to that top shot basically.

241
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,399
Petty: We haven't designed in the actual characters yet for the game.

242
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:04,466
Tim is still writing and coming up with exactly what the world is.

243
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:10,446
So we just sort of picked a character out of one of Bagel's sketches and put it into the game.

244
00:15:10,446 --> 00:15:12,846
And we needed to do, you know, we just needed it to move around.

245
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:15,340
So I just did some really quick animation on it.

246
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,500
It's certainly not great animation but just to get it to kind of move around the world.

247
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,300
And follow the camera.

248
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:27,820
And so I think, you know, you kind of get a sense of, is how the camera might follow the player and kind of lag behind the player.

249
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,133
How it might move around the screen.

250
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:37,433
And you'll see that one of the things we're doing here with this character is that as he's in this canopy, he's kind of tinted green and darker.

251
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:40,500
And as he emerges into the sun, here he becomes a little brighter.

252
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,360
And we don't really have, you know, any true lighting that's going to paint it into the painting,

253
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,819
but I'm doing some simple things where we're using like color gradients based on location of the world and kind of multiplying it in this character.

254
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,253
Just with the goal of getting to feel part of that environment.

255
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:58,087
And that's a type of trick that we could do technically in the game image if we wanted to.

256
00:15:58,087 --> 00:15:59,181
And it's really quick to do.

257
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:01,541
But it's enough to help him harmonize with the environment.

258
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,033
Schafer: Please join me in welcoming Mr. Chris Remo to the company.

259
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:20,840
[Applause] Schafer: Remo's our community manager.

260
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,300
He's been here now for two weeks or so, ish.

261
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,520
Chris, could you please stand up.

262
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:31,560
[Laughter] Any questions about any of that stuff before we talk about projects?

263
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,960
I'll give you the update on Double Fine Adventures, awesome game.

264
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:42,060
I'm working on design stuff and we have a team actually working on tools and engine and visual,

265
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,626
pre-visualization of what the art side will look like.

266
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:49,126
And I'm putting together one of my deliverables for the milestone, in a couple weeks.

267
00:16:49,126 --> 00:16:50,306
It's like a story document and stuff.

268
00:16:50,306 --> 00:16:55,500
And at that point I'll be like probably sharing more info about the game with other people company-wide.

269
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,100
Rice: Well I mean, Tim's been doing brainstorming stuff for a while.

270
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,947
And that's still what he's doing, just kind of holing up in his office and figuring out what the game is.

271
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,425
Schafer: You know, at the very beginning I'm locked in my room a lot writing dialogue.

272
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:16,453
But then I kind of have the job of pulling this whole thing down the road.

273
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,013
You know, so I was ready to finally pitch to the team.

274
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,819
I'm not really, haven't really felt right to pitch to the whole company yet.

275
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,699
That'll come later but, so I pitched to the whole team.

276
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,380
Schafer: OK. So I'm going to talk about the game today with everybody.

277
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,040
And some people have heard about it and some people have not.

278
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,640
Did I talk to you about the game?

279
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,240
Some people have not, not just you.

280
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,333
[Laughter] Petty: There're several people in Wisconsin.

281
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,953
Schafer: As you see, I've made a lot of progress.

282
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,480
I've designed some monster designs. Rice: I like it.

283
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:53,440
Schafer: And then I was going to go and do some detail about some ideas for the beginning of one side of the story.

284
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,200
Just 'cause the first example, like a sample game play and then we can all tear it apart

285
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,520
and talk about how it's never, never, never going to work.

286
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,920
Schafer: And it's an interesting process where...

287
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,680
deciding when to solicit feedback and when to actually sell.

288
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,713
It's like sometimes you're selling and sometimes looking for feedback.

289
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:20,960
And the idea... And early on I could sense like in the meeting, 'cause we talked about that as being a feedback session about the pitch and stuff.

290
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,007
I realized I didn't want any feedback right then, like any in-depth feedback.

291
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:30,926
So I kind of pitched the game and then kind of moved the meeting forward and ended it and because there is an early stage

292
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:34,454
where you don't want any feedback because it doesn't really mean anything.

293
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:39,487
Because they don't know still entirely what you're thinking and they might have an image in their head

294
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,680
but it probably isn't exactly like what I have in my head.

295
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,653
So I almost don't want their opinion of it because they're not talking about the thing I'm talking about.

296
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,460
They're talking about their own, how they see it.

297
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,180
Offscreen Voice: Can I contribute as a devil's advocate?

298
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:57,446
Schafer: I like where this is going.

299
00:18:57,446 --> 00:19:02,466
Remo: To me the strongest parts of this by far are the thematic aspects of the two characters in parallel.

300
00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:06,420
Especially switching between those, I think, could be incredibly important and really, really cool.

301
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:13,580
Both in terms of game play and aesthetics and the stuff supporting that seems so high-concept to me that it might end up being top-heavy.

302
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:18,740
Like it seems, it just seems like a really complicated thing.

303
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:26,500
Schafer: People at, you know, at that meeting can bring up any sort of problems but it's just too early, you know.

304
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,920
I dare them. Nice try, Chris Remo.

305
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,987
What were we thinking inviting that guy to the meeting?

306
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:39,100
Hey, maybe this thing you're doing shouldn't be done. Thanks.

307
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,140
Remo: That's... I mean...

308
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,760
Schafer: I guess because I see it working in my head, it isn't that complicated.

309
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:53,466
I see that being like just providing a structure, actually, to how everything has to behave.

310
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:58,406
Schafer: I do want is like when I say the idea, what other ideas that makes that person think of.

311
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,700
Like you know what would be cool? And how they want to add to it.

312
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,520
Petty: I love hearing new ideas.

313
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:09,620
I like, Tim is a very, a lot of times Tim, the way he describes ideas is like, like the fact he described a box cover for a game

314
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,787
that doesn't exist is a very Tim thing to do.

315
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:16,540
Like he has, he's not an artist per se, like visual artist, but he thinks very visually.

316
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,446
And I think that's helpful for someone like me and it's probably why we work so well together, is, you know,

317
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:26,980
he's got these ideas and I can sort of, you know, as he's drawing out the birthday cakes and stuff like that

318
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,000
I probably shouldn't talk about...

319
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,380
As he's drawing out some of the ideas on the white board in really simple fashion, I'm immediately starting to think about like,

320
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,374
well, how's that going to put together in the space and how can we emphasize that or make that work.

321
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,813
And so that's exciting to hear.

322
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,353
Schafer: Anyway. So you pick which side you're on.

323
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,527
I've only been, I've been working on this one a little bit.

324
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:51,020
So imagine it would just kind of scroll the boy off the screen.

325
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,940
And she would be sitting here leaning on this tree on a hillside.

326
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,247
My drawing gets worse and worse the more people are watching.

327
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:05,587
Kipnis: Are those her legs?
Schafer: It could be
Lee: She's a tick.

328
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:08,907
Schafer: Yeah, turns out she's a tick in the end.

329
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,540
Kipnis: They're both human.
Schafer: They're human, yeah,
yeah, they're human.

330
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,166
Petty: Yeah, I think the idea's really cool and I think visually, I think there's a lot of interesting stuff that we have,

331
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:27,000
I haven't really had a chance to talk to Tim yet, but I think there's a lot of interesting stuff thematically

332
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,840
that is appealing to me.

333
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,940
I mean, there's this sort of almost Tale of Two Cities quality to it.

334
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:37,306
I can see a lot of good ambiguity in the way that that story is structured.

335
00:21:37,306 --> 00:21:39,300
I think that's really, will be great.

336
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:44,200
And to be a way that we, from a design and narrative way move the genre forward a little bit.

337
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,380
Kipnis: I want, I want something new to be brought to the table that wasn't there before.

338
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:56,200
And I'm not sure what that is quite yet because I still don't have like a very clear idea of what the game's going to be like.

339
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,494
But hopefully I can contribute to that.

340
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:06,760
Franzke: Yeah, I know, I'm confident from a technology point of view be able to do what is necessary.

341
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:09,560
I hope it's going to be good.

342
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:20,986
[Music] Schafer: All right. Rice: Wait you forgot the big thing.

343
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:22,306
Rice: Bar crawl.

344
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,260
Schafer: Who can go to the bar crawl tonight?

345
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,520
Petty: I can't go tonight.
I'm too sick, actually.
I have to go home and sleep.

346
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:46,360
[Music] Offscreen Voice: Actually, Tim, can you just say what we're doing again?

347
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,500
Schafer: Where... you don't know where we're going?

348
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
Kipnis: It's for the camera.

349
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,400
But you know, should I make sound really natural like I'm just happy to be talking about it?

350
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,300
Kipnis: Hey Tim, where are we going, by the way? Do you know?

351
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,434
Schafer: What? Kipnis: Where are we going?

352
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,640
Schafer: I don't know. Where are we going? No.

353
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,900
Tonight is a very special night because we are going to retrace the history of Double Fine

354
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,533
through the code names of our projects.

355
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,800
Shall we do that again?

356
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,440
Projects.

357
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:25,000
The history of our company as told by the code names of our projects, which are mostly taken from Chinatown dive bars.

358
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,753
Offscreen Voice: Why don't you tell us about what happened last night?

359
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,620
Schafer: You mean between me and, oh, oh.

360
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,180
Last night.

361
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,313
So we went on a quest last night to find a code name for the project.

362
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,434
It's fun. I mean we used to, like in the very beginning of the company,

363
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,146
when we only like, the whole company was like twelve people, we'd go out a lot together.

364
00:23:43,146 --> 00:23:47,026
And go bar crawling together and we hadn't done that a lot lately.

365
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,387
But it was fun to get back out there again with the team.

366
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:53,867
Kipnis: I think you're, you're greatly overestimating my alcohol tolerance.

367
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,420
Schafer: All I heard is you are great.

368
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,060
[Laughter] Schafer: It was like a team kickoff event.

369
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:07,593
[Music] Schafer: Lipo was the very first code name of our very first project.

370
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,967
This is the code name for Psychonauts.

371
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,220
Rice: Never heard of it.
What's that?
Schafer: Let's go.

372
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,633
Schafer: Buddha is the code name for Brutal Legend.

373
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,507
Hi, I'm Tim. Nice to meet you. What's your name?

374
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:21,587
Man: Peace again. Schafer: That's a weird name.

375
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,660
Schafer: EZ5 is the code name for Happy Action Theater.

376
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,933
Grasslands was our code name for Psychonauts II.

377
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,140
Who knows if that'll happen. If that happens, we call it Grasslands.

378
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,807
Bow Bow was the code name for Brutal Legend II, we started on that.

379
00:24:39,807 --> 00:24:57,094
[Singing] Schafer: There's some documents called Bow Bow.

380
00:24:57,233 --> 00:24:58,973
Vesuvio was Once Upon a Monster.

381
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,573
Empress is short for Empress of China and Empress was the sequel to Once Upon a Monster or Twice Upon a Monster,

382
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,613
it probably would have been called but that got cancelled.

383
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:13,987
But you still go there. It's important to go there and remember, pour out a drink for the cancelled projects.

384
00:25:13,987 --> 00:25:40,500
[Clinking glasses] Schafer: And last night we found what might be the last bar in Chinatown

385
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,600
that we haven't named anything after and that's Red's.

386
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,486
Schafer: Hey, here's to the Red's team. Red's.

387
00:25:59,486 --> 00:26:02,286
That doesn't sound bad at all. Red's.

388
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,800
Schafer: Code name Red's.

389
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:12,233
