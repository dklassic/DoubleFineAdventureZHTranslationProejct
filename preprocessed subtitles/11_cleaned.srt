00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:44,006
[Piano plays Mozart's Piano Sonata No 11] McConnell: This is the first music I remember in my life, hearing.

2
00:00:44,244 --> 00:01:02,780
[Music] McConnell: So it's the Swiss side of me there.

3
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,557
It's just really great to be able to sit down and play something without turning it on.

4
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,607
Makes music.

5
00:01:14,338 --> 00:01:42,380
[Music] Hansen: I get really nervous around cameras, it's my thing.

6
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,300
All right.

7
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,360
Hansen: Yeah, Shellmount first pass.

8
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,960
Dead Eye God first pass.

9
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,460
Lumberjack first pass.

10
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,340
Localization QA starts.

11
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,140
Rice: Live instrument recording.

12
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,580
Liu: Yeah, VO play-testing and testing.

13
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,700
Rice: This is the big one.

14
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,400
Liu: Oh, you're putting it in all caps?

15
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,160
Rice: Of course. There it is.

16
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,819
Schafer: Do you want to talk about schedule stuff before we begin the meeting?

17
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,599
Rice: Sure. Very exciting stuff.

18
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,340
Schafer: Greg's got exciting schedule stuff to talk about.

19
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,660
Rice: OK. Well, today's end of a sprint, right?

20
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,900
So we should talk about this in light of that.

21
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:56,206
But yeah, Matt and Sue and I have been working on schedule stuff for the project for a while now.

22
00:02:56,206 --> 00:02:59,126
So we have a lot of data that I guess we'd talked through.

23
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,940
But I guess first we should probably just walk through how all this stuff happened, to explain where we came from.

24
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:16,213
Bailey: And the thought is, is that we potentially have scope-wise, enough content for a game to ship sooner rather than later.

25
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,300
Schafer: January for Part One and April for Part Two.

26
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,480
Schafer: As long as it's definitely just Part One and you're definitely going to get Part Two.

27
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,507
It's not just, because I hated the end of Empire.

28
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,720
I mean, when I was a kid and they ended that way, I was like what the fuck?

29
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,860
Rice: So that's how we got to this.

30
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,780
So this is kind of where that is for Part One right now and then there's also Part Two down here.

31
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:49,380
But it kind of gives you a good snapshot as far as what the next year would look like to hit that January date.

32
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,220
Schafer: And even this is pretty scary when you look at just two weeks, total for Dead Eye God Pyramid.

33
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,174
Like us all together working on that and banging that whole room out.

34
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,880
The interior and the exterior in two weeks, right? Rice: Yep.

35
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,700
Schafer: Has that been proven to work by January? Or April?

36
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,766
Rice: Yeah, I mean as far as, like as accurate as we can get.

37
00:04:08,766 --> 00:04:11,303
Like we're, Schafer: You did already or...

38
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:12,988
Hansen: We quantified that. Schafer: OK.

39
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:18,787
Rice: Yeah. We went through and like assigned what each of those scenes, how complex they are compared to an average scene, which we called the Galley.

40
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,558
And ran the numbers on all of it and that's how we figured out like how many scenes and what type we can get.

41
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:28,265
So there's a little bit of fudging there, like if you have scenes that are super-complex,

42
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:31,085
that's going to count as more than something that's a hallway.

43
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,614
Schafer: It also shows the consequences of if we don't get that Dead Eye done in two weeks.

44
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,420
You see there's no other room for it to go into expect for the push.

45
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,780
Rice: Yeah.

46
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,620
Schafer: Push all the other dates out, which would be a huge problem because the deadline in January

47
00:04:44,623 --> 00:04:50,923
is a revenue-based deadline, basically that Justin says he needs that revenue in January orâ€¦

48
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,600
Bailey: The reason the game must be done in January is because that's at the time we've run out of funds for that game.

49
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,855
We're taking all the funds the studio makes and putting it into Broken Age.

50
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,108
Like all of them.

51
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:13,637
So, but it becomes, in January, this comes this point in time where floating that big of a team on an ongoing basis

52
00:05:13,816 --> 00:05:18,316
just can't be done out of our own royalties and our own profits of the studio.

53
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,020
Like it breaks at that time.

54
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,140
So yeah, we just, we have to ship something and have to start making some money off that project.

55
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,998
Peck: It's a little surprising that we have four weeks for spaceship Beta, given how far we've taken it.

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,924
Rice: Yeah, and I think so, too.

57
00:05:33,924 --> 00:05:38,248
It's weird when you look at that stuff, but the reasons are like if you look at this list,

58
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:45,056
the amount of scenes in the spaceship are pretty much equal to the amount of scenes in the entire girl's world.

59
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,443
And you know there is, Lee: Animation.

60
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:49,823
I mean you got to do all the final animation.

61
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:51,383
Rice: All the animation, Lee: a lot of cut scenes.

62
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:55,954
Schafer: And the thing about that is, is that this, because this is so tight and uncomfortable and there's not a big space for like,

63
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,402
there's some play-test feedback in here but it's not like a month of just play-test feedback or two,

64
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,662
which is what we'd really like.

65
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,000
So I think we're always going to have to be looking at places where we're finishing some things early

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,183
and if that four weeks sounds like a lot of time, that maybe hopefully it means that the game play programmers

67
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:14,363
could get ahead to create that buffer where we actually do have like a month to play-test feedback.

68
00:06:14,363 --> 00:06:15,383
That would be awesome.

69
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,480
Schafer: The schedule's done and I want it to be a little more like a home run

70
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,526
than it is, because it's kind of like yeah, it looks on paper like we can do it,

71
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:24,214
but there's not a lot of wiggle room.

72
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,740
And normally you want a lot of buffer time because things always do go wrong and take longer than you thought.

73
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,210
So I think we just have a little more work to do on it to make sure we have enough buffer room in it.

74
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,616
Or we have to go along every time we get something done, try and get it done a little early.

75
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,816
But that's always kind of like dreaming.

76
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,980
Like every project, you want to do that.

77
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,980
Like, oh, let's just get everything done a little bit early and then we'll build up a buffer time.

78
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,934
But I haven't, haven't ever seen that really happen.

79
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,060
Rice: Do we have other thoughts?

80
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,220
Questions?

81
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,520
This thing's all alive so it's really easy to plug numbers in it and change them around and see where it goes,

82
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:05,100
Schafer: I think the, doing early access for the game impacts Oliver the most.

83
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,171
Because his stuff has to be done.

84
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,240
His system work has to be done in January.

85
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,553
He's got to have a shippable product in January, which means all the, there's a lot of like stuff that, you know,

86
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,020
you tend to have pushed off to the end of the project, just the kind of like, maybe it's optimization

87
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,160
or just wrapping things up to make sure that they're airtight.

88
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,280
You know, that all has to happen a lot earlier.

89
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:28,323
And that's probably hardest on him.

90
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,220
Rice: Yeah. I mean, I guess the only thing is just, just know going into starting on Monday,

91
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:38,380
we're spending three months on Sugar Bunting and then, three weeks...

92
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,780
Schafer: Three months! Three months!

93
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,752
Rice: God, I wish.

94
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,860
No, three weeks on Sugar Bunting and then moving on, so.

95
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,340
I mean, you can see why.

96
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:52,424
Schafer: OK. I wrote a thing explaining the early access stuff to the backers and we'll do an update on Monday.

97
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,980
That is, a full-on update with the episode on Monday?No.

98
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,291
Rice: No. Episode will be Tuesday; I think you're just going to post in the forums, like.

99
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,760
Schafer: So when is Chris writing an update, on Tuesday.

100
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:05,951
Schafer: And that's the one that's attached to the episode.

101
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,756
Schafer: In Red's this week we're having episode ten go out live, which is the one where we're talking our shipping plan.

102
00:08:14,947 --> 00:08:20,047
And so that could be very active, a very active week for the backers.

103
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,000
Active in just how much they love the new plan, talking about that is what I mean.

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,520
And then, Team Member: Is it going out today?

105
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,380
Schafer: Tomorrow.

106
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,100
Schafer: OK, here's my post. Long post.

107
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,119
I like the first thing; sounds great.

108
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,620
And so the wait for January begins.

109
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,187
What a pleasant fellow.

110
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,000
And what would we need the next one, mean and horrible.

111
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,760
Sounds OK with me, chief.

112
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,840
See, like they're talking to me.

113
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,226
People are pretty polite.

114
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,700
Yeah, see all these people are really positive about it.

115
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,169
I don't want to scroll down any farther in case someone says something mean.

116
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,000
But let's see how long is this thread.

117
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,140
This is like three pages now, four, five.

118
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,521
Schafer: We announced the new plan for releasing the game on our forums and our backers are pretty great about it.

119
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:02,734
I mean, they want to talk about it.

120
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,491
They were, you know; want to make sure it was going to be a good thing.

121
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:12,483
And I think we had a pretty good reaction to it, which is good, because I would like to have this be locked and settled

122
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:16,148
and just move on to working on the game and not worry about this.

123
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:21,019
But some press people took that out of our backer forums and put it up.

124
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:27,220
Some of them put the entire post up, which is actually better than what others did, which is take a couple words here and there

125
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,520
and then put the headline as like "Kickstarter Out of Money".

126
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,300
You know, like implying the whole things crashing and burning.

127
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,607
Bailey: Just eight news sources right now.

128
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:38,087
Looks like it's got the Escapist.

129
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,000
Double Fine wasn't being greedy with second Kickstarter.

130
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,060
I mean, there's a couple people that are just reacting like, oh crap, there goes, there goes Kickstarter.

131
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,680
It's all a sham to begin with.

132
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,665
And other people are like, c'mon, right.

133
00:09:55,276 --> 00:09:59,766
Schafer: They're just, there's this whole crowd of people who are dying for anti-Kickstarter news.

134
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,986
And I don't know why that is, but some people are just like, Argh, I hate this Kickstarter thing.

135
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:05,186
I can't wait for someone to just totally fuck it up.

136
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:07,646
That's frustrating, but what are you going to do?

137
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,940
Just to make the game awesome, get it out there and then track them all down individually and kill them.

138
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,780
Bailey: There's some cynicism out there.

139
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,406
I mean, there's skepticism and that's somewhat to be expected, right?

140
00:10:19,406 --> 00:10:22,417
Because there hasn't been a big Kickstarter yet that's actually delivered.

141
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,080
So I mean, I can't blame too many people for being skeptical.

142
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:34,981
I think this all, you know, in the fullness of time will play itself out, so when people see the end product it'll, you know, people will forget about this.

143
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,040
But right now there's, yeah, there's a bit of a shit storm.

144
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,580
Rice: Yeah, do I look tired?

145
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,340
Rice: Longer than I should have been. Yeah.

146
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:57,627
Remember how after the trailer we talked about how I looked at all those forums and everything was super-positive?

147
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,300
It was definitely not the case last night.

148
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:10,240
So yeah, I spent a lot of time reading all of those comments and trying to see what were actual points we should think about

149
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,860
and what is just kind of misinformed.

150
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,060
But yeah, I don't know.

151
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:22,675
I mean, I think it's, our backers have been great about coming to our support and clarifying when people are giving kind of the wrong information

152
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,160
and things like that. Yeah.

153
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,760
Schafer: We were basically all caught off guard with it leaking and then going negative so fast.

154
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,683
'Cause it's like, 'cause the more I look at it, the more you're like OK, we're taking, we're making a bigger game than we Kickstarted.

155
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:44,600
We are, we're delivering it later but we're paying with our own money for it and then doing this early access to fund the rest of it.

156
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,353
And then to have that framed as a total scam and a rip-off by us, just is kind of mind boggling.

157
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,240
Bailey: So basically the press leaked our stuff, which is a violation of our terms of use.

158
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,410
Remo: Because this is the thing when you're a journalist, like I've been a journalist

159
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,427
and I feel like it gives me a decent perspective on this stuff.

160
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:11,480
Because as soon as one person goes live with it, every single other person who publishes it is not violating shit.

161
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,540
In fact, they're almost derelict in their duties for just ignoring it.

162
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,475
Because as far as they're, from their perspective, it's public information that's already out there.

163
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:27,462
So you're being actually just kind of a weird like lackey to some developer if you're just saying, well, they wanted me to not do it.

164
00:12:27,462 --> 00:12:28,522
Rice: That was the case.

165
00:12:28,522 --> 00:12:30,834
Like once one person broke it, then now it's public.

166
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,252
Schafer: Then looking back on it, we could have done a lot of things different, but I don't want to learn the lesson.

167
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,160
The most obvious lesson that you could learn from that, is that you should be less transparent.

168
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,020
Like OK, we were just so open and transparent and all that, that we could have probably like,

169
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:49,200
we could have probably massaged that message better and hid a lot of stuff, but I don't know if that's really the lesson

170
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,980
I want to learn from that, you know what I mean?

171
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:56,469
Like if we had hid the whole thing and just been like, you know, every three months push the launch date out three months

172
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:59,393
like most companies do with games, so they just slip it out.

173
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,680
And then, then hey!

174
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,015
By the way, I know it's not coming out 'til May, but here's an early access thing in January.

175
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,600
That's a great thing, everyone would have been wow, that's great.

176
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,748
So being more secretive could have protected us from that, from that bad public response.

177
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:17,818
But that goes against everything that we're trying to do with the project, was to be completely open and show everybody everything.

178
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,491
Remo: Part of it's also this was just like a learning experience for us in a way.

179
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:25,311
I think that even if we do have another thing that is this significant that we're putting out there,

180
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,940
I think we would just, knowing this was going to happen, probably could have done it a little smarter.

181
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,625
At the time, I don't know how we would have necessarily had that foresight.

182
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:39,540
Like to the degree it would have been necessary, but I think we just need to be more careful.

183
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,770
Schafer: And now it's out there and whatever, you know, the press makes of it or whatever weird comments we get from people

184
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,648
who weren't backers, that's over.

185
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:58,100
Well, it might go on tonight and tomorrow, but we production-wise have moved past that and are just now focusing on the game.

186
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:05,960
Schafer: Hello.

187
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:09,317
Schafer: Oh man, look at that.

188
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:11,782
It's like the whole town.

189
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:15,466
The whole town looks like it's got sugar, like little sugar canisters; that's awesome.

190
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:22,977
Gardner: Right now we're kind of like in the middle of switching from, I mean I'm sure you've heard from the spaceship to the Vella's

191
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:25,928
like neighborhood and baker town and all that stuff.

192
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:28,277
Roberts: Yeah, this is the first shot that they'll see.

193
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:36,756
And so what we're doing is layouts right now, where we're just basically getting the staging with the art backgrounds

194
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:40,170
and the characters in and we're doing what we call rough blocking.

195
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:45,706
So in the play-throughs we can all watch it with Tim and everybody and just say, OK, does that work?

196
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:50,445
Does this work with the game?

197
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:52,743
Schafer: It's pretty important, I guess, that we figure out where everyone's standing.

198
00:14:52,743 --> 00:14:55,844
Because this is like the, like the final resting place for everyone, do you think?

199
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:57,110
Where we want them?

200
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,319
Petty: The witch is facing the wrong way.

201
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:04,486
She should be facing towards the cake, but we needed enough space for you to be able to walk around without accidentally clicking on someone.

202
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,434
And that was, that was where we wound up.

203
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:10,104
Schafer: He could also be shoved facing left over here more.

204
00:15:10,104 --> 00:15:12,604
'Cause this thing is, this is a kind of unnecessary thing...

205
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:13,575
Petty: We can just paint that out.

206
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:21,937
Schafer: And it looks so prominent, that you kind of want to play with it, but you could use that shelf space, too, if he was like closer to it or something?

207
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:26,440
So you wouldn't be tempted to walk, like you'd be tempted to walk this way around him instead of this way.

208
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,668
Petty: We could always put like little photos of, maybe there's like little black and white photos of him

209
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:32,002
as a young warrior or something.

210
00:15:32,002 --> 00:15:35,031
Like he's staring at like his past, you know, or whatever.

211
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:37,138
If you want to put some little subtle stuff there.

212
00:15:37,138 --> 00:15:38,913
Schafer: OK.

213
00:15:38,913 --> 00:15:43,827
Offscreen Voice: Well, you know, we try to put as much in as we can, because we're so limited on time.

214
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:50,889
So we know a lot of this stuff is going to change once we get final dialogue, because we don't have the final actors.

215
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:54,115
We don't have those recordings and that can change a lot of the timing.

216
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:56,822
Garner: Famous people, like real actors?

217
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:01,494
They all read dialogue a lot slower than our scratch dialogue.

218
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:09,776
Our scratch dialogue is when we go in and do recordings and we all sort of act out the characters.

219
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:19,267
Garner: Bring me a star chart and the fabric of time and space shall be knit to serve your passage.

220
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:24,120
[Inaudible 00:16:19] Stamos: I came in this morning and Cam's like,

221
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,739
he said we need some more mom voice.

222
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:28,108
So I'm like, oh, all right.

223
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:29,781
I guess that's me.

224
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:34,034
Stoddard: I actually like, I really like, I like how you did the mom.

225
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:39,714
Stamos: Well, I'm reading it just as me, so since I am a mom, I guess that's OK.

226
00:16:39,714 --> 00:16:41,530
Stoddard: You got a good mom voice.

227
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,532
Rice: Is there anybody else on this ship?

228
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:49,926
So you've never seen a strange wolf around?

229
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,438
Stoddard: Well done. Rice: All right.

230
00:16:52,438 --> 00:17:00,396
Team Member: So we would like to try to get as much as could into these scenes without having to change everything entirely.

231
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:01,925
Once we get that final dialogue.

232
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:07,781
So we're kind of doing a lot of stuff that you would do sequentially, all at once.

233
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:11,604
Schafer: And they try not to do too much, so you can tell some of them are animating more than they should there,

234
00:17:11,604 --> 00:17:13,638
because they just wanted to make a nice scene.

235
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:19,510
And soon we're going to file dialogue for all that, so we'll be able to polish that up like we couldn't before.

236
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,551
Schafer: Should we just start listening to stuff.

237
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:23,731
Brown: Yeah, we can just go down the list.

238
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:25,619
Schafer: Let's do it.

239
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,108
Khris and I started working together at Lucas Arts in the '90s.

240
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:31,257
Like she started, Brown: 1990.

241
00:17:31,257 --> 00:17:34,506
Schafer: What was your first job title at Lucas Arts?

242
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:37,166
Brown: I was the Product Support Supervisor.

243
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,117
Schafer: Yeah, she was in Prod Sup, yeah.

244
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:44,486
And then, but the first thing you did sound on for me is Full Throttle, right?

245
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:47,091
Brown: Uh, Schafer: Or did Tentacle, no you were in...

246
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:48,094
Brown: Day of the Tentacle.

247
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:49,276
Schafer: You were in Day of the Tentacle.

248
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:53,380
Brown: We said dirty things to Mark Hamell in his headphones and that's true.

249
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,703
Schafer: We learned a lot.

250
00:17:54,703 --> 00:17:56,106
Brown: And we learned a lot.

251
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:57,347
Schafer: You've learned a lot since then.

252
00:17:57,347 --> 00:18:00,355
Super-professional mature now.

253
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:02,316
Let's listen to some more voices.

254
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:05,321
Schafer: I had a meeting with Khris where I actually listened to the first auditions.

255
00:18:05,321 --> 00:18:07,546
So we listened to a whole bunch of auditions.

256
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:09,223
A few of them were good, but it's just the start.

257
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:11,320
We're going to listen to a whole lot more auditions.

258
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,495
We have a bunch of characters to cast.

259
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:18,034
Audition Voice: You came because you are done with children's games.

260
00:18:18,034 --> 00:18:23,653
My name is Merrick and what I'm about to show you is no game.

261
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:25,404
Schafer: Pretty good, but I think I like the other guy.

262
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,276
Audition Voice: David Kaufman Merrick. Schafer: Whoa.

263
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:31,681
Audition Voice: You came because you are done with children's games.

264
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:36,242
My name is Merrick and what I'm about to show you is no game.

265
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:45,571
While you've been drifting through the universe, eating ice cream and playing with trains, war has been raging across the galaxy.

266
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:53,860
Between the forces that every war is between, between the powerful and the weak, the tyrants and the innocent.

267
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,111
Does it even matter there will always be war.

268
00:18:57,111 --> 00:19:01,305
We did not start it and we cannot stop it.

269
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:10,968
But what we can do is protect the weak and rescue the helpless.

270
00:19:10,968 --> 00:19:12,529
Schafer: That guy's pretty awesome.

271
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:14,419
Is it a higher pitch than I imagined him having?

272
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,310
But I love how he read it.

273
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,239
Schafer: Well, we had our first casting session.

274
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:22,653
Khris was on Skype and I was listening to all the auditions.

275
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:23,408
They were good.

276
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:28,198
There were a couple characters that I felt like, that's exactly right; we could use that voice.

277
00:19:28,198 --> 00:19:33,457
For a lot of them, and the main ones, I think it's going to be a longer process where we just take the first listen

278
00:19:33,457 --> 00:19:36,685
and then Khris and I have something that we can talk to together.

279
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:41,000
Like where is this, instead of just reaching out in the dark, we're like, OK, now we've heard a voice.

280
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,569
Is it older, younger than this?

281
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:45,161
Is it meaner or nicer than this?

282
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:54,472
You know, we can talk about all the different ways we want to use that as a landmark to know, navigate to actual voice that we want.

283
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:59,032
Is that a good metaphor?

284
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,819
Schafer: OK. Well, we have a company meeting at 2:00 o'clock also.

285
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:03,160
Brown: Oh.

286
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,254
Schafer: Oh God. What do you think is the most important thing to listen to?

287
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:10,331
Brown: I think the most important things to listen to are Shay and Vella.

288
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:11,237
Schafer: Vella.

289
00:20:11,237 --> 00:20:13,438
Let's listen to some Vellas.

290
00:20:13,438 --> 00:20:19,745
Audition Voice: Need help cleaning up?

291
00:20:19,745 --> 00:20:20,586
Schafer: There's something wrong with that one.

292
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,503
I don't know what it is.

293
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:29,367
Audition Voice: Hi. Need help cleaning up?

294
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:31,820
Schafer: Not bad.

295
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,010
Audition Voice: I think it's time we start fighting that monster.

296
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,939
Schafer: It sounds really young to me, it's like her little sister, but I don't know.

297
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,767
I'm trying to think of what 14 year old girls sound like.

298
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:54,325
Khris: There's a sample of a 15 year old girl and her audition is bitchy and I don't like it,

299
00:20:54,325 --> 00:21:00,175
but it just gives you an idea of what a 15 year old girl sounds like.

300
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,007
Audition Voice: What you got?

301
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:03,911
Let me see that.

302
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:06,579
Nah, I don't really need it that bad.

303
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:10,598
Schafer: Her acting is kind of a problem.

304
00:21:10,598 --> 00:21:14,465
Hm. OK. All right.

305
00:21:14,465 --> 00:21:17,070
Brown: Oh no! I hate to make you sad.

306
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:21,805
Do you want to hear all the "B" list ones that didn't get put up?

307
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:25,513
Schafer: Oh no, I was just saying, you know, I mean listen to them all.

308
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:27,127
Brown: We have tons of auditions.

309
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:28,899
Schafer: I know. I mean, is there anything really unique in there?

310
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:33,086
I guess I was looking for something that was kind of special, unique in some way.

311
00:21:33,086 --> 00:21:34,509
Brown: Special like?

312
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:36,689
Schafer: Super likable. They're all good.

313
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:37,969
I mean, they're all good.

314
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:44,726
They're all in the right, correct range, I think, in age for the most part, except for that one that sounded really young.

315
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:50,896
I guess I was looking for one with like a personality that would leap out at me.

316
00:21:50,896 --> 00:21:52,096
But I think it just takes time.

317
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:55,231
I think I just have to listen to them a whole bunch of times.

318
00:21:55,231 --> 00:22:00,227
Brown: Yeah, but I don't want you to be like beat into submission, beaten into submission,

319
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:03,765
like and reconcile yourself to something less than what you truly want, you know?

320
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:04,773
Schafer: When would I ever do that?

321
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:06,408
When would I ever let that happen?

322
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,509
Anyway, that's how it goes.

323
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:14,713
Schafer: You get the first listen and now Khris and I, whoa, [inaudible 00:22:08], I spit all over my Rubik's cubes.

324
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:19,737
Yeah, no, she has a little clearer idea of what I think of each character now that we have something to compare it to.

325
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:25,040
And I'm still, still pursuing some like, friends, friends and famous people for the game.

326
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,324
We'll see where that goes.

327
00:22:26,324 --> 00:22:29,922
I don't want to say anything , 'cause what if it doesn't happen, I'll just feel stupid.

328
00:22:29,922 --> 00:22:34,325
Schafer: Possible, one might say celebrity cameos in the game?

329
00:22:34,325 --> 00:22:36,498
Me, just me.

330
00:22:36,498 --> 00:22:39,393
Actual bona fide celebrities.

331
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:41,755
Offscreen Voice: People that we've used, actors that we've used before?

332
00:22:41,755 --> 00:22:44,777
Schafer: My hope is to use actually a lot of people that we have used before, just for some fun small parts,

333
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:51,240
like Richard Horovitz and Nicky Rapp and contact Mr. Black, see if he's available.

334
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,967
He offered to do that, like before.

335
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:54,054
Offscreen Voice: Oh, he did?

336
00:22:54,054 --> 00:23:03,090
Schafer: He said, Offscreen Voice: He should be the hipster lumberjack.

337
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,900
Petty: You know, last week I got some of the UI stuff cut up and integrated.

338
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:13,478
And I also got most of the way through doing the kind of like, they're not implemented in the game yet, but the white box for all the Shellmound.

339
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:17,414
My goal is to get those all in the game and hooked up by end of the week.

340
00:23:17,414 --> 00:23:21,501
Petty: This is really kind of where a white box, now we do have some basic layering set up here.

341
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:23,519
And I did some basic camera work.

342
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,944
But this shows the basic layout of the scene, the key elements in place.

343
00:23:26,944 --> 00:23:35,382
So these are, you know, just quick black and white drawings, but they, some of them like this, without going into too much detail,

344
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:40,648
this particular scene has a very strange layout in some ways because you have to see this sort of distant view of Shellmound,

345
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:42,755
because it sets up something that happens later.

346
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:46,410
So it really wasn't that any of these are the final shapes or languages or anything.

347
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:53,682
Or even really the final shot, as much to make sure that all those elements had a place and could work together in a single screen composition.

348
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:59,447
So you kind of have to work at a certain level of detail just to be able to figure that out and to communicate that to Bagel.

349
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:03,382
Petty: My goal is to get all those all in the game and hooked by end of the week.

350
00:24:03,382 --> 00:24:05,096
Schafer: It will close, too.

351
00:24:05,096 --> 00:24:07,365
Being almost all white boxed.

352
00:24:07,365 --> 00:24:09,305
Camden, world of sound.

353
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:17,020
Stoddard: Last week it was mostly filling out space ship and there's still a few glitches timing stuff that I have to work on and kind of tighten up.

354
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,480
Stoddard: Yeah.

355
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:30,500
It's a super high tech spaceship, but at the same time, like I kind of think it would be kind of fun to like have stuff kind of squeaky

356
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,180
and you can hear the wheels and the joints working and things like that.

357
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:38,862
So I'm trying to get some elements with Laura's key card.

358
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,680
Laura: Ready? Stoddard: Yep.

359
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,360
Great. Awesome.
Laura: Yeah, yeah?
Stoddard: Perfect.

360
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,000
And I'm starting to do some things with like phase and modulation.

361
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,520
[Squeaky sounds].

362
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,640
Getting like this almost like alien machinery sound.

363
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:12,900
But I was also noticing some of its properties I could do for like some of the robots.

364
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,060
Like almost chattering.

365
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,600
Schafer: Cool. Rusty?

366
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,060
Russell: Beginning of the week was mostly some prop stuff for the girl's house.

367
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:28,201
And then it's up to the Mog Chothra one so you get the textures done.

368
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:36,683
Russell: So Adrien was actually involved with doing the character modeling and the rigging, but he went off to another project to help out.

369
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,980
Offscreen Voice: This was supposed to be a shot of you, hard at work on another project.

370
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,120
[Laughter] Skillman: The backers are going to love that.

371
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:55,743
Russell: But because they had a vacancy to fill because Adrien left, I'm the next guy up.

372
00:25:55,743 --> 00:25:56,363
So yeah.

373
00:25:57,706 --> 00:26:01,406
Some of the stuff I'm doing is just like going back through old files.

374
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:04,826
Like a lot of this stuff was made for the actual teaser trailer.

375
00:26:04,826 --> 00:26:13,526
And Adrien's got a lot of rigging things that he did for us that in the meantime that some of these older rigs need to get updated with.

376
00:26:13,526 --> 00:26:19,546
So like this girl, this is the girl in the cake that you probably saw in the trailer.

377
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:26,400
I'm adding actually the lower half of her body so that when she gets pulled out, you know, she actually has a body that comes with it.

378
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:32,540
So he was also done pretty early on in the project, so we kind of revamped him and revamped his skeleton.

379
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:42,719
So he's got some, some other controls now that you can kind of do a little parallax so that if he's trying to turn, this part can,

380
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,080
you know, look like it's going behind him a little bit.

381
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,169
He's got the ability to open his jaw and stuff now.

382
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:59,369
Schafer: Jessie! Whoa! That's scary.

383
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,563
Schafer: I've actually been able to write now so I wrote the Maidens Feast stuff as you saw

384
00:27:03,563 --> 00:27:07,043
and that's been delivered and Malena's putting that in the database right now.

385
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:09,863
And then the next thing I'm going to be working on, I think is Shellmound.

386
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,400
Schafer: I think I'm going to plunge ahead with it, new stuff just to make sure no one's blocked by dialogue ever again.

387
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,480
Schafer: I hope that I get the dialogue done in the next month or two.

388
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,645
All of it done and then it'll just be me reviewing and redesigning and rewriting stuff.

389
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,120
Play testing.

390
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,760
Schafer: Holy crap. Bailey: I know.

391
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,621
I was playing Day of the Tentacle and I was playing some of the other old games and I just noticed that

392
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:36,561
in a lot of those games there's multiple writers.

393
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,117
Is there a way to bring on a junior writer?

394
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,680
Schafer: I mean, I'm always open to that.

395
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,180
We did that on Psychonauts.

396
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:50,480
It's just always been, it's really been hard to find people that do it exactly, exactly right.

397
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,680
And it's also, it's kind of time consuming to read a bunch of writing samples.

398
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:04,580
It's a possibility, like if some rock star writer just walked in the door and was ready to go, I would be totally open to that.

399
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,860
This is where you cut to some rock star writer walking through the door.

400
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,160
Someone that actually looks like a rock star, but he's got pen and paper.

401
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,800
Petty: Would you rather have help there or in design?

402
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,365
Schafer: Well, design I can always get help by just having brainstorming sessions with people and having people,

403
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,565
you know, to talk to and to give ideas.

404
00:28:21,565 --> 00:28:24,445
Everybody's got like a lot of ideas to offer.

405
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,900
Petty: We had the ax, which I presume he could just hand you.

406
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,664
And he makes a stool, you could make here.

407
00:28:34,817 --> 00:28:36,857
There's a bathroom where you get the stool.

408
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,280
That'll be the only part of this meeting that Paul puts on the next episode.

409
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,280
Rice: Well, I mean, how are feeling?

410
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:54,340
Schafer: I think what I want to do is put all those cuts in and really just do a puzzle graph,

411
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,522
where I'm looking at all the puzzles that are in the game, and counting them and see how many we have,

412
00:28:58,522 --> 00:29:01,002
how that compares to past games and kind of hours of game play.

413
00:29:01,002 --> 00:29:04,321
'Cause I don't want to have a game that's like, you know, three hours long.

414
00:29:04,321 --> 00:29:05,961
I just want to make sure that we're still having that puzzle count...

415
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:08,698
Rice: You see, that's funny to me, because it seems like you're always complaining about long games.

416
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,765
It seems like everyone in the office enjoys short experiences.

417
00:29:12,765 --> 00:29:17,395
Schafer: Well, there's short and then there's like, holy crap, I can't believe they took two years to make this game.

418
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,540
Rice: Yeah.

419
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,540
But I mean, the longer you go, the just like more dilute it gets, right?

420
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:30,754
And just in general it seems like favoring a well-polished core experience over, Schafer: I'm not talking about those kind of things.

421
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,922
I'm not talking about diluting it.

422
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:34,653
I'm saying like, like we, Rice: But it's what we're doing, right?

423
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:37,700
Schafer: No, i'm not, hold on- Rice: There's only a certain amount, Schafer: Shh.

424
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,880
Let me get this out.

425
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,010
Like Lee and I were talking, like in Stacking.

426
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,100
We talked about Stacking.

427
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,043
The content of stacking is not low, like there's tons of density and tons of characters and stuff like that.

428
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:55,051
And we used to talk about ways of it trying to extend, like there's content people just miss when they go through it,

429
00:29:55,060 --> 00:30:00,882
that possibly mechanically we could have brought more into the critical path of the game, right?

430
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:05,682
And it always be, no matter what we do when we ship, there'll be a big call, like it's too short

431
00:30:05,682 --> 00:30:10,116
because people always complain about it especially adventure games being too short because they rush through them.

432
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,122
You know, some people want to rush through them, and then they're like, ah, it's too short.

433
00:30:13,122 --> 00:30:15,069
Rice: I do think it's a recent phenomenon, though.

434
00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:17,920
People arguing the other way.

435
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,440
Schafer: We're not going to be able to make this game too long.

436
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:26,470
There's nothing we can do to make this game feel too long or be too long, because you just cannot extend that content, that's hand-made in that way.

437
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,900
We have no systems that we could accidentally turn the screws on and all of a sudden make it.

438
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,340
Rice: Yeah, I guess I'm just, don't see it as an issue if it feels short.

439
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,057
Schafer: I do, but I do.

440
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,720
I think there's a certain value proposition.

441
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:45,251
Like a ripped off feeling if it's not, you know, there's definitely a minimum.

442
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:52,772
Rice: We only have so much money to spend and so much time on this game, so like, the more content we put in, the less time we have to polish it.

443
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,132
So it's a delicate balance.

444
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:00,368
But I think he's just, he just doesn't want us to like finish and we do a full play-test of the game and it's like two hours long.

445
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,943
And it just feels empty, but like, there's no way that's going to happen.

446
00:31:04,943 --> 00:31:11,282
Like I'm, I'm pretty sure it's going to be like 8, 10 hours, just based on what we've seen.

447
00:31:11,282 --> 00:31:15,093
Rice: Yeah, and I think Full Throttle's the one specifically people always call out to him,

448
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:22,620
and I think it is, 'cause it is a more like linear narrative kind of, like I don't feel like I got stuck a ton in Full Throttle.

449
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,640
And I don't think anyone who'd play it now would say it's short.

450
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,293
Rice: We are making an 8, 10 hour game maybe, who knows?

451
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:36,089
But like either way, we're making an hour of music so it's not going to fill the whole game.

452
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:42,000
So does that mean we have parts that don't have music?

453
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,540
That rely on ambience?

454
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:50,221
Does that mean we write extra music like we did with Cloud Colony?

455
00:31:50,221 --> 00:31:54,201
But it seems like there's conflicting opinions between people on the team.

456
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,580
Schafer: Between Brian and Peter? Rice: Yeah.

457
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,401
Min: It's just that things like we have the Cloud Colony, for example, where we made changes, McConnell: Right.

458
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:06,334
Min: so like, you know, a month goes by, we have to keep moving.

459
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:14,129
But you know, we couldn't get feedback from you so there's inefficiencies there so, McConnell: I think, but I didn't know there was feedback to give.

460
00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:21,802
I think we, I do think we need to revisit the Cloud Colony stuff because quite honestly, the new version doesn't work for me.

461
00:32:21,802 --> 00:32:23,572
It feels too fast.

462
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,317
It doesn't feel drifty and floaty anymore.

463
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,649
And you know, I ran it by Tim and he felt the same way.

464
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:36,695
Min: You have to understand where I'm coming from, I'm trying to meet deadlines to make sure that we have certain things, certain momentum.

465
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,317
So the creative feedback is nothing personal, we're not trying to inject our own kind of thing.

466
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,205
McConnell: Well, Brian, listen.

467
00:32:42,205 --> 00:32:43,085
I understand totally.

468
00:32:43,085 --> 00:32:44,335
You were just trying to solve a problem.

469
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,649
Min: Yes. That's exactly right.

470
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:51,215
McConnell: The responsibility for not checking the game sooner, it'll never happen again.

471
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:57,180
Stoddard: Well, clearly the workflow needs better communication from here on out, between the four of us.

472
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,340
McConnell: Yeah, totally.

473
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:07,273
Stoddard: Pete is contracted only for a certain amount of music and we have to find a way to stretch it out,

474
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,878
because the game's going to need a lot more time than that.

475
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,958
McConnell: You know, how do you cover, how do you cover all the ground that you need to cover?

476
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,152
I mean, that's really what's behind this question, right? Min: Yeah.

477
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:23,223
Rice: So Peter, I was talking to Brian about this and I think it is actually a lot, McConnell: It's an important question!

478
00:33:23,223 --> 00:33:26,723
Rice: Yeah, and I think it's actually really similar to what we've been facing with the art team.

479
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:32,013
'Cause you know, when we started out on this game the whole idea was that it was going to be a really tiny adventure game

480
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,335
and Bagel was going to draw every character and every environment in the game.

481
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,160
McConnell: Right.

482
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:41,640
Rice: And obviously it's just a much larger game now to where he can't do all of the art.

483
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:49,140
So we've had to expand the art team and figure out how to make that work and how to make the game feel like it all looks like what Bagel would do,

484
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,375
even though there's been a lot of hands touching it.

485
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:59,105
It's going to be a matter of getting pieces from you that essentially feel like concepts for this is what Cloud Colony music sounds like

486
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:00,988
and this is everywhere it goes.

487
00:34:00,988 --> 00:34:06,711
And then we let Brian and Camden run with it a bit and just keep throwing stuff over to you to see if you like

488
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,491
the direction that they're kind of expanding things.

489
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:19,881
McConnell: I mean, I actually think it's going to be an interesting problem to solve, to you know, work with you guys to make this score bigger.

490
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,426
So I mean, I'm looking forward to it.

491
00:34:22,426 --> 00:34:32,905
I'm not seeing this as a, you know, I just see it as what we're dealing with and something that has interesting, you know, an interesting challenge.

492
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:48,940
[Music] McConnell: Back in Boston, after I got out of college,

493
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,780
one of my housemates in Boston was Michael Land.

494
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,280
And we worked together at, and he later became the Sound Director at Lucas.

495
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:03,484
I saved up some money and quit my job at Lexcon and drove out West and the idea was to, you know, start a band.

496
00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:09,912
Well, by the time I got here, he had gotten his job at Lucasarts and so you know, you got to check this out.

497
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:17,426
I got involved in that and first as a consultant and then, and then, you know, I joined the Sound Department.

498
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,740
And he definitely helped get me started in game music.

499
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,840
So I'm very grateful to him.

500
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,700
My biggest tool for really starting is this handheld thing here.

501
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,820
I just walk around and hum stuff into it.

502
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,380
[sings notes from Star Wars theme] If I do any more, we'll have to pay John Williams.

503
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,721
You know, I know how to operate this thing.

504
00:35:41,721 --> 00:35:43,244
Ah, gee, that's a pretty catchy tune.

505
00:35:43,244 --> 00:35:44,877
Maybe I should, maybe I should use that one.

506
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,610
So I would hum into this machine.

507
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:51,173
Then come back to it and see if I still liked the melody.

508
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,722
I'm a big melody guy.

509
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,260
You really need to go home whistling something.

510
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,420
If the person who listens to it, if they're a musician or not, they're going to sit there and hum it later.

511
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:07,607
For Psychonauts, I used to send Tim, you know, little MP3 files of you know, hey, here's what I'm working on, Tim.

512
00:36:07,607 --> 00:36:12,147
You know,
[Hums a theme]
Great.

513
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,600
I think I'll have to hear it more in context.

514
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:29,766
[Music] McConnell: So then the next stage would be to actually

515
00:36:29,766 --> 00:36:31,291
sort of work it out at the piano.

516
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,220
And notate it.

517
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,804
Broken Age is a really interesting one, actually.

518
00:36:35,804 --> 00:36:42,473
I think it's one of the hardest scores I've ever done, because in something like Grim Fandango there are,

519
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:54,784
there're sort of recognizable worlds with, with sort of little plums of you know, this is sort of central American city with a noire, an art deco vibe to it.

520
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,680
This is a dock, like in the Maltese Falcon.

521
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:04,540
There're real specific cultural references in that and Psychonauts, there're really specific cultural references.

522
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,840
And if there weren't, I stuck them in there.

523
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:15,660
But Broken Age is, it's a fable about a very, a completely imaginary world.

524
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:24,137
The village, the Meriloft, the spaceship; they're these very, they're worlds unto themselves.

525
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,840
And so I'm really trying to find sounds that are also sounds unto themselves.

526
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:39,193
My initial feeling was that the town needed to have this sort of combination of maybe an African sort of vibe and also a Scandinavian vibe.

527
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:47,260
One of the Scandinavian instruments that I was interested in is called a kantele, and it's a dulcimer, hammer dulcimer-like instrument.

528
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,592
So I have a kantele sample here.

529
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,160
A lot of these samples are going to get replaced by real instruments.

530
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,320
The autoharp was another one.

531
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,300
[Music] McConnell: And that's the kantele.

532
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:01,940
Cello.

533
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:09,940
Kalimba, which is a, this is a kalimba.

534
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,180
I'll play it in a second.

535
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,240
It's a, also known as the thumb piano.

536
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,798
It has these little tines that you pluck with your [demonstrates].

537
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,980
And then it has these little holes that allow you to give it sort of a vibrato.

538
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,940
And that's a traditional African instrument.

539
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:38,540
[Music] McConnell: And so here you have the flute.

540
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,620
It's really spare.

541
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,520
It seemed like a lonely scene.

542
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,880
[Music] McConnell: That's sort of the whole ensemble.

543
00:38:51,880 --> 00:39:00,200
You hear violin, you hear, that's a kora sample, which is aâ€¦

544
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:11,341
McConnell: So this is a combination of the African sound and then we have kind of a European fiddle.

545
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:19,891
[Music] McConnell: So that's, that's you know, that's sort of the first pass.

546
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,080
It may be really different, you know, when we're finally done.

547
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:28,218
Composing for games, you know, it's a little cliche, but it's different from other media

548
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:38,860
because when you write music for film, no one is, you aren't, you aren't, building the theater and redesigning the projector every time.

549
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,926
With games, you pretty much are.

550
00:39:40,926 --> 00:39:43,413
You're at least redesigning the projector.

551
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:52,544
It helps to be involved in the actual technical aspect of things, not just throwing the, the music over the wall and hoping that it gets put in OK.

552
00:39:52,544 --> 00:39:54,322
And then checking it out later.

553
00:39:54,322 --> 00:39:57,952
I mean, that's a great way to do things and sometimes it's kind of what we have to do,

554
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,880
because we're all, you know, under the schedule pressure and so on.

555
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:09,487
But sometimes it's nice to be able to actually get your, roll up your sleeves, get your hands into the game.

556
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,659
Really see firsthand what's not working about it.

557
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:20,320
Make a change and then five minutes later you know, there it is, the way you want to hear it.

558
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,760
McConnell: I'm just going to see if I can actually get a signal in this system here.

559
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,549
I really have no idea what I'm going to do, actually, to be honest to be with you.

560
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:41,648
But I'm, I've been trying, playing some violin into it.

561
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:48,743
And then I'm just going to look at a couple of other sounds I might use and see if I can make sort of a, little bit of a score here.

562
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:56,340
[Music] McConnell: OK, so that's a good place to start.

563
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:11,518
[Music] McConnell: Those little sounds you hear in the background

564
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,060
are things that I played on the violin already.

565
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,657
I have a little bit of a synthesizer bed now.

566
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:27,100
I'm going to play, I'm going to play some violin to it.

567
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:33,316
I'm not playing to a click, so this is just sort of a free, free ambient thing.

568
00:41:33,912 --> 00:42:11,420
[Music] McConnell: My Prime Time is broken.

569
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,020
Oh, nice. I think it's not broken.

570
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:27,080
And it's like, I'm not quite sure why we're not, oh.

571
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,982
So I've set up a sample and hold loop.

572
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:44,360
By plucking the violin, it's going through this old Lexcon Prime Time, which is now sampling and holding that sound and making a repeating echo out of it.

573
00:42:45,126 --> 00:42:48,506
And I sort of like this kind of heartbeat thing that's going on.

574
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:57,520
And I've pitched it down by an octave, by messing with the, this was the original sound.

575
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,920
So I'm just going to record that.

576
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:41,900
[Music] McConnell: And I don't know if that's what we'll use for that scene,

577
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,764
but it might be something like that.

578
00:43:43,764 --> 00:43:45,064
And it's a huge score.

579
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,440
There're three of us working on it.

580
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:57,700
So we'll be taking my ProTools files with the midi information in them, re-voiced with different synth sounds, do different remixes.

581
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:03,763
And this is something that we're evolving, you know, we're working on it right now, exactly how it's working.

582
00:44:03,763 --> 00:44:07,203
So it's, you know, it's definitely paving new ground.

583
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:21,475
McConnell: You know, one thing about working hard at music is, is your head does get cluttered a lot with all the parameters and the deadlines

584
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,700
and you know, am I going to do it this way or am I going to do that way?

585
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,797
And when am I ever going to get rid of that awful synth sound I'm using?

586
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:37,380
And all that kind of stuff, it just kind of melts away when you, when you come up here and get a little perspective on things.

587
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:43,840
I think in some sense music is an imitation of nature or the world around us.

588
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:51,720
And I just really like to be here whenever I can make it up the hill.

589
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,520
Because it is a little reminiscent of the field that the girl starts out in, now isn't it?

590
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,580
When I did that theme, we hadn't moved yet.

591
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:06,580
So I sort of had to imagine that field and work to the picture.

592
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:22,956
But you know, the idea of a, of a beautiful field with solitude that you can go to, to just get away from everything and we have a little village below,

593
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,540
it's definitely, you know, definitely resonates.

594
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:34,282
So maybe now that we're moving back to the girl's world, maybe it's time for me to take more of these walks.

595
00:45:35,960 --> 00:46:03,800
[Music] Schafer: Whoo! Full functionality. Ship it.

596
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,700
I think we should ship it at the end of the week.

597
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,120
I just really want to ship it. Ship it.

598
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,191
Anything else? No? OK. Thanks, everybody.

599
00:46:12,614 --> 00:46:55,818
[Music] Schafer: That was the most funny thing about him, is he gets,

600
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:00,094
I've never seen anyone get madder at computers than Peter McConnell God fucking dammit!

601
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,202
Like he gets so, 'cause nothing else about his personality is like that way, rage-y.

602
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:08,960
But when like a machine, when a computer won't do something, he gets so mad.

603
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,480
It's always fun to see him.

604
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,840
Oh, man, I was hoping you'd capture that.
