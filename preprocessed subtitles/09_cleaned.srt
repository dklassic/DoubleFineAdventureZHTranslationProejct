1
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,294
Schafer: Oh, here's a copy of my notebook for Grim Fandango.

2
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,343
And then here's me trying to figure out the name of the game.

3
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,025
Dead Leads. Deadly Deeds.

4
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:32,065
Deeds of Death. Death's Deeds.

5
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:40,820
You know, I read my old names to you because Grim Fandango was such a great name that it was funny to see all the bad names,

6
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,899
but right now I don't have a name for this game, so all these names, it's just sad.

7
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,300
I did make a nice chart, though.

8
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,400
Puzzles on it.

9
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,939
Don't show that.

10
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,180
This is a horrible process, by the way.

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,060
It's just not going to have, we're going to end up with some terrible name like Stacking.

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,160
Just kidding, Lee.

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:28,054
[Music] Schafer: OK. So we'll start the email thread about this.

14
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,723
Thanks for everyone hustling to get the build running.

15
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:30,650
It worked great.

16
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,910
I was very proud of it.

17
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,870
It was awesome.

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,406
I hope no one's feelings got hurt. OK.

19
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,869
Awesome. Thank you.

20
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,729
Kipnis: I liked the little animation polish that Chris did on that.

21
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,609
Choy: Do we just send our notes out? Is that what we do?

22
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:45,140
Schafer: Yeah Schafer: I like your cascading Post-its.

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:02:06,500
[Music] Schafer: Ron Gilbert.

24
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,220
Ron Gilbert, I've been pestering him to play the game and give us his feedback.

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,300
And he's been really busy but now The Cave is done and now he's going to play the game.

26
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,367
He's going to play it.

27
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:23,180
All the Cloud Colony stuff that we have today and then we're going to talk at 4:00.

28
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,680
He's going to tell me what he thought.

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,018
Offscreen: Why didn't he play the game during the HOF, because I saw him in the meeting.

30
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,780
Schafer: Oh, he said he was going to play the game during the HOF, but when I said, I kind of got the impression he has not played it yet.

31
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,540
I think he had a lot of email to read that day.

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
He's been busy.

33
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,580
He's not busy anymore.

34
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,840
You know, he's made some of these games before.

35
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:52,120
So he's got very particular things that he would do if it was his game that might drive him crazy if we didn't do them the exact same way.

36
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,440
Schafer: So we'll find out.

37
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,120
I don't know.

38
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,780
What he'll think.

39
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,440
He'll probably say, eh, it's fine. Whatever. Who cares.

40
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,100
All right.

41
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,320
Schafer: Thank you for playing.

42
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,020
Do you have any general impressions of things you'd like to share?

43
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:20,520
Gilbert: Yeah, I think my general impression was that, I mean, it's very interesting playing point-and-click games.

44
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,416
There's a certain, there's a certain serenity to them, which is nice.

45
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:32,047
You know, you just, I kind of felt like I could just lean back in my chair and I could just think.

46
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,800
And there wasn't any pressure going on, which I kind of liked.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,839
So I thought it was very, you know, enjoyable experience and then it kind of brought back, you know, some of those, you know,

48
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,740
really old, you know, point-and-click feelings.

49
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,660
Schafer: And these are my notes from Ron's play-through.

50
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:53,361
Tram puzzle, he liked the tram puzzle.

51
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:57,361
He had four things that he liked and he had three pages other stuff.

52
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,350
Gilbert: Do you want me to keep going?

53
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,830
'Cause I'm onto the do-not-like's now.

54
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,850
Schafer: Oh no, you don't do any of those.

55
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,690
Gilbert: OK, so I'm done.

56
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,870
Schafer: Wait. You've got four likes and then three pages of you-don't-likes.

57
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,542
Gilbert: And then three pages, well, you know...

58
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,274
Schafer: OK, let's go. Let's do it.

59
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,216
Gilbert: I'm not happy gamer, I'm grumpy gamer. OK.

60
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,823
Things that I did not like.

61
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,119
The dialogue trees didn't seem very focused to me.

62
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,960
Falling through the clouds was super annoying.

63
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,700
I thought the characters walked too slow.

64
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,400
Schafer: OK.

65
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,000
Schafer: The exit arrows.

66
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,215
He wanted exit arrows when you're just panning across the room, which I don't know if I...

67
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,640
I don't know if I agree with that one, but it's worth thinking about.

68
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,060
And then I just had some ideas for dialogue while he was talking.

69
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,160
Was that decisive looking?

70
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,311
Schafer: Starting with some sad news.

71
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,880
I think some of you saw the email went out that one of our co-workers is leaving

72
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,369
My old friend Ron Gilbert is going to be leaving Double Fine and pursuing his, it's a big round of boo's for Ron Gilbert.

73
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,449
Boo.

74
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,260
[Laughter] Boo-urns.

75
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,980
We don't handle good-byes well, Ron, here.

76
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,580
To pursue his lifelong dream of not working at Double Fine.

77
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:24,060
[Laughter] Ron will be leaving pretty soon, like today.

78
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,429
He doesn't like long drawn-out emotional good-byes, so he wanted to just leave and not just linger on.

79
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:35,861
But yeah, do you have a long speech that you'd like to make at this point?

80
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:36,701
Gilbert: I don't.

81
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:47,240
[Applause] Schafer: And with those words, [Applause]

82
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,400
Schafer: He left.

83
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,160
Offscreen Voice: You knew he was leaving, you didn't tell anybody.

84
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,066
Schafer: Just a little while.

85
00:05:54,066 --> 00:06:00,030
I mean, we'd talked about it like, pretty honest about, you know, him coming to the company, doing a game.

86
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,877
What are you going to do after?

87
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,174
He didn't know.

88
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:09,583
He, Ron's pretty independent and has always, you know, more naturally is kind of a loner, rebel.

89
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,628
Dangerous.

90
00:06:10,628 --> 00:06:11,648
Drifter.

91
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,929
And you can't keep him in a cage, man.

92
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:18,789
Can't just contain Ron Gilbert.

93
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,449
But we're sad to see him go.

94
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,749
I liked, I liked having Ron around.

95
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:26,169
He's like my older brother in the games industry, kind of.

96
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah, he said, he said he would still, every time I sent him a build, he would play through it and give us some us some feedback

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,318
so hopefully we'll have him come back in or Skype with us from wherever he is.

98
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:43,179
Schafer: That's what he was going to do originally, was just play the game, give us feedback, help us out to give us some, some, his opinion about stuff.

99
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,760
And he said he'd still do that, so now we just don't have to pay him so it's kind of win/win.

100
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:50,284
Gilbert: ok Schafer: Any last words?

101
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,280
Say, say good luck.

102
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,940
It's going to be great.

103
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,952
Say good luck, it's going to be great.

104
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
Gilbert: Good luck, it's going to be great.

105
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,239
Schafer: Well, thanks, Ron.

106
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,542
Gilbert: I really look forward to playing it again, Tim.

107
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:02,622
Schafer: Awesome, thanks, great. OK.

108
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:21,500
[Music] Schafer: You're all over the new episode, man, let me tell you that.

109
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,100
Schafer: Hello, everybody.

110
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,460
Hey, nice to see you all. Hello.

111
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,868
Thank you for coming.

112
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:33,280
Rice: For Red's, we got, Game Informer is going to be doing a big spread on the game

113
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,040
and they're coming by in a week and a half to talk with Tim and play the game and everything.

114
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:44,100
So it should be like a six-page spread coming out in April on that game, which is right after our trailer.

115
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,920
So we're starting on that now, too.

116
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,486
But it's going to be busy PR times very soon.

117
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:55,024
During GDC we're doing a Brutal book launch party, so that should be good.

118
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:56,567
Everybody's invited to that.

119
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:58,527
And we'll get you details on that, too.

120
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,220
Lots of things.

121
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,544
Rice: So that kind of stuff has been happening now.

122
00:08:02,544 --> 00:08:09,151
We have this, this kind of schedule for our first little chunk of P R and I'm sure there'll be more down the line as the game

123
00:08:09,432 --> 00:08:12,159
actually gets closer to coming out.

124
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:17,113
But this is more just a, for people who had never heard about Kickstarter or not anything about the game,

125
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:24,894
this'll be kind of the first time they hear about the game as a game instead of the game as a product of the Kickstarter.

126
00:08:24,894 --> 00:08:31,504
Rice: How is everybody feeling about showing the game in a week and a half and doing a trailer in three weeks?

127
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,740
It's crazy.

128
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,220
People are going to be talking about the game.

129
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,436
Schafer: It's easy, right?

130
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,200
Petty: I think it all hinges on how awesome the name is.

131
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,393
Petty: It's a small little tidbit.

132
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,040
It's your window into the game.

133
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,680
Rice: So it'll be actually, you know, announcing the name of the game.

134
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:57,262
Doing a teaser trailer and then also doing some interviews with press and talking more in detail about what the game's actually about.

135
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,248
Petty: Ah, yeah, so.

136
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:04,187
Well, there's a lot of tasks related to all that and I'd say it's probably going to take up two-thirds,

137
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:06,527
easily two-thirds of the sprint for the majority of the art team.

138
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:15,349
Rice: No, I mean, it's a hard thing because no matter what, showing the game publicly is going to eat into the schedule somehow.

139
00:09:15,349 --> 00:09:17,336
Whether it's a trailer or a demo.

140
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,940
Like there's always going to be work that's done specifically for that, that wouldn't have been done otherwise.

141
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:28,411
But I think it's just a matter of you got to talk about your game and you have to like get out there.

142
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,924
Otherwise you might make a great game, but nobody knows about it.

143
00:09:31,924 --> 00:09:42,377
So it's just kind of give or take of let's figure out the points in the schedule where we're going to be able to insert these things with the least amount of pain,

144
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,161
but also to get like the biggest positive affect for the game.

145
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:51,652
And I think that just happened to be right now because this is when PAX is and GDC and all the big conventions.

146
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,980
And so we want to take advantage of those things falling in line with our dev cycle

147
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:05,360
and try to figure out ways to have something at those events that people will be excited about while still minimizing the impact on production of the game.

148
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,825
Rice: So Game Informer stuff.

149
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:10,223
And they're obviously flying someone out here.

150
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:17,218
So we have to try to figure out a part of the game that they could play that would like hold up all right.

151
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,060
Schafer: I mean, Cloud Colony's was the thing we HOF'ed, so it's playable.

152
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:30,554
Petty: So I think the thing we're needing on that for you and Tim or Tim and you to play through the Cloud Colony

153
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,211
and identify kind of what your demo loop is and see if there's any additional polish you want us to do.

154
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,360
Rice: Yeah, well, so he's coming Wednesday, next Wednesday.

155
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:46,582
So I would imagine we want a good, at least half day of hammering from tests, just to make sure everything is... Kipnis: At least.

156
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:47,652
Rice: what we think it is.

157
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,280
Yeah, so I don't know.

158
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,720
Do you want to try to lock it down Monday night or do you want to lock it down to Tuesday afternoon?

159
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,403
I mean, he's not coming 'til afternoon Wednesday.

160
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:59,183
So we have Wednesday morning also.

161
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,247
Kipnis: Yeah, let's not, let's not, let's not take it to the wire like that.

162
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:11,561
Let's just aim for Monday end of day, which may be like before Tuesday 10:00 a.m. or something.

163
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,040
Rice: I'll write down "end of day Monday".

164
00:11:15,473 --> 00:11:24,586
Kipnis: It's kind of what I'm working on right now, is making her movements be at a good speed and also, look right with animation.

165
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,420
So this is her like running.

166
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,415
So like, you know, clicking kind of close by, she'll do a walk, but clicking sort of far away, she'll run over.

167
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,402
But the fact that she switches to and from, faster, travel method is good ultimately.

168
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:38,902
We just need it to look good.

169
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,140
It'll take a little bit of animation for that.

170
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:44,760
Rice: Cool. All right.

171
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,798
I'm going to jump on that call, but this is good.

172
00:11:46,798 --> 00:11:50,601
It feels like it's not far off at all.

173
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:52,201
Kipnis: No, no, it's not so bad.

174
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,600
Rice: All right. Thanks, guys.

175
00:11:55,123 --> 00:11:56,623
OK, cool.

176
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,997
Rice: Water? Soda?

177
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,000
Turi: I'll grab a water.

178
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,900
Rice: All right. Turi: Thanks.

179
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,560
Rice: Have you been here before?

180
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:20,200
Rice: The nature of being in a magazine business is that they have a lot of readers, so they get a lot of big exclusives because they have such a, a wide reach

181
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,720
and it's a place that people go often to announce their games or show really early stuff.

182
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,055
And so they're used to seeing busted builds and bugs and whatever.

183
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,880
And...

184
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,360
Why is this ringing?

185
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,520
Double Fine.

186
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,940
Voice on Phone: Hi. I'm looking for Tim Schafer.

187
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,060
Schafer: That's our mobile kind of guy over there.

188
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,046
This is our R&D group doing secret stuff.

189
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
That's Oliver. He's our lead programmer.

190
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,160
Franzke: Nice to meet you. Turi: Nice to meet you, Tim.

191
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,980
Kipnis: Hi, how's it going?

192
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,880
Turi: Good. Nice to meet you. I'm Tim from Game Informer.

193
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:03,054
I just watched your side quest thing so, I know way more about you than you do me, but that's all right.

194
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,720
Turi: You guys are talking, did you say that you're thinking, what is the release date, like the projected release date or window for...

195
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,380
Schafer: Who's saying... Rice: We're still working on that.

196
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,040
Schafer: Later. Turi: Yeah, OK.

197
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,090
Schafer: Later this year.

198
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,852
Rice: Yeah, I mean it's hard 'cause it's still being designed and you know, still working on it.

199
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,616
Turi: They said, they said just holiday.

200
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,144
But is it, is there any chance for that at all?

201
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,342
Like with the...

202
00:13:25,342 --> 00:13:26,362
Schafer: Getting this game done by the holiday?

203
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:27,642
Can we get this game done by the holidays?

204
00:13:27,642 --> 00:13:28,722
Rice: Up to you, man.

205
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,560
Schafer: So i'll click right here first, just to set things up.

206
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,920
It's a point-and-click graphic adventure, Turi: Oh, you guys are excited about that

207
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,437
Schafer: Yeah, remember that thing from the pitch video?

208
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,582
So you walk around.

209
00:13:46,582 --> 00:13:48,638
You have an inventory down here to bring up.

210
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,140
Right now, Turi: It's cool.

211
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,551
It's cool as it always is, you know.

212
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:56,241
I'm in a, I'm in a position of like responsibility when it comes to this.

213
00:13:56,241 --> 00:13:59,376
And like there's a big responsibility that comes with checking the game out for the first time

214
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:05,047
and I'm really excited to see what people have to say about this, because this is sort of a game out of time.

215
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:09,327
You know, it's something that's a relic, but it doesn't look like one.

216
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:15,334
But you know, the genre is something that hasn't been really around much outside of like The Cave and them some like indie games.

217
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,589
I love having the responsibility of, you know, taking this experience with like Tim and Greg,

218
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:25,129
checking out the game and presenting it to our readership, you know.

219
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:27,009
So they can keep it on the radar or not.

220
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,564
Schafer: I don't know.

221
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:31,392
I don't like showing the game ever before it's done.

222
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:33,652
There's a, it's like people have to force me to show it.

223
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,672
Like I always joked that I would never show the game at all, except for to my family and that's only when it's done.

224
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,511
But I wouldn't let them take the shrink wrap off it, ideally.

225
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,740
Because it's never quite done.

226
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,199
Schafer: And this is a preview; that's one thing.

227
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,482
Previews are pretty usually pretty gentle on you.

228
00:15:00,726 --> 00:15:04,363
I mean, they normally don't be like oh, man, I just saw a sneak peek.

229
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:06,248
This game's the worst I've ever seen.

230
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:07,853
They're usually like, yeah, they're working on it.

231
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:12,419
Here's what they're working on and we hope it turns out cool, 'cause they'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

232
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:15,939
Then they send a different person in to review it, who's like, just a total dick.

233
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,980
Especially at Game Informer.

234
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,881
Schafer: So there you have it.

235
00:15:20,881 --> 00:15:21,806
Those are our kids.

236
00:15:21,806 --> 00:15:26,026
So we now, what do you think the best title is for this story?

237
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,280
Turi: Yeah, this is a difficult thing, probably to name, I assume.

238
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,365
Rice: We've got ideas.

239
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,780
Schafer: We ain't got nothing.

240
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,123
There was Young Monsters.

241
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:41,023
Turi: OK. Schafer: Small Offerings.

242
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,511
Turi: Hey, I like that.

243
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,800
Schafer: Broken Age.

244
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,760
Schafer: But yeah, so we're going to keep coming up with some ideas and we'll definitely have it to you by Wednesday. Turi: OK.

245
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,122
Rice: Tuesday. Turi: Tuesday.

246
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,733
Always trying to push it.

247
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,035
Always get one more day.

248
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,760
Rice: I don't think you can stop the printing press.

249
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,865
Schafer: Usually I have the game named and the characters named before we talk to people.

250
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,885
So I don't know if the press is early or the game is late.

251
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:08,985
Probably the game is late.

252
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,219
But it's not that late.

253
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,455
It's great. Game is doing great.

254
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,593
Backers. Don't worry about it.

255
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,680
It's doing fine.

256
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,460
Schafer: Here's another fun trick to do.

257
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,380
Young Monsters.

258
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,000
That font is terrible.

259
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,020
This is the laziest box art ever.

260
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,380
Ah, that's hyphenated.

261
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,480
Ah, fuck it.

262
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,140
Schafer: I thought I'd come up with a great title this weekend, but I chose not to.

263
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,583
Crook: Did you come up with any bad ones?

264
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,680
Schafer: And I could just name the damn kids, I could just call it the game whatever their names are.

265
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,400
Like Banjo Kazooey.

266
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,240
Ryken: I think you just need to spend a day dressed up halfway as a girl and halfway as a boy.

267
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,647
Schafer: Dream on.

268
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,547
Ryken: It'll come to you.

269
00:17:04,547 --> 00:17:05,767
Schafer: I know what you're after.

270
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,379
Schafer: So the process was kind of grueling, 'cause the game's already so established,

271
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,210
it's always hard to name a game when it's already established.

272
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:18,285
It's a lot easier to do it before you've, before you've done anything, 'cause then the design kind of, you feel like you're just building on that name

273
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:20,739
as opposed to attaching a name later.

274
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:26,208
Petty: The reason why I'm really enjoying Tim's struggling with names is because I got a year of shit from Tim about the name Stacking.

275
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,140
And I never came up with anything better.

276
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,229
Schafer: I don't know.

277
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,640
This is the team's suggestions.

278
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,565
The Distant Neighbor. A Girl and Boy.

279
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:39,311
The Encounter. A Tale of Two.

280
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,246
Kindred Odyssey. The Unfinished Bridge.

281
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:43,260
The Strange Offering. The Kind Double Creatures.

282
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,259
The Kind Endangered Creatures. Mom Can Be Annoying.

283
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,711
Get Off My Back. Divided Interest.

284
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,653
Dude, Where's My Ship? Collision Course.

285
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,820
Collision Curse. Similar Lines.

286
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,134
Deep Lines. Split Decision.

287
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,460
True Lies. Collateral Damage. Predator.

288
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,740
Schafer: It's hard to come up with space names, ask George.

289
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,960
Greedo? Come on.

290
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,440
Crook: Prune Face?

291
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:12,780
Franzke: Can I also ask, so the trailer, what is the actual, what's, what's up with that?

292
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,342
Are we, are we planning on rendering that in game, what is the scope?

293
00:18:17,342 --> 00:18:23,115
Rice: So we, I talked with Lee and Tim about like a script for it and Majus is doing an animatic for that right now,

294
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,958
so hopefully within the next few days we'll start seeing what that looks like.

295
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,200
Just so you guys can see what scenes and everything will be in it.

296
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,666
Rice: Yeah, but it's just a matter of what we can pull off, right?

297
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:36,380
And I think that for now, just talking about the trailer is probably the most time sensitive thing.

298
00:18:36,702 --> 00:18:48,117
But I guess the idea is to try to get something that would be, you know, exciting enough for people to see onstage at GDC awards

299
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,535
or just kind of a large event.

300
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,120
Rice: The next big thing is the GDC thing.

301
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:59,617
So Tim's hosting the award show and we've been working on a teaser trailer, like a short little 45 second thing

302
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,740
showing the actual game in motion for the first time.

303
00:19:02,987 --> 00:19:07,209
Schafer: I was imaging we would take the approach of looking at all of our cut scenes

304
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:13,379
and look at the ones that are farthest along and seeing if there's like three that can be polished or chunks of them.

305
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:19,358
Like things that are dramatic, like the girl falling through the sky or you know, things that we already have done somewhat.

306
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,397
I mean, I'm not against having shots where we show environments.

307
00:19:22,397 --> 00:19:23,257
Like pan of our environments.

308
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:29,694
Just if it's only that, that's an obvious like, maybe just 'cause I'm in the games industry, you know what that trailer is.

309
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,940
It's like we don't got nothing.

310
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,873
Schafer: It's not yet a solved problem.

311
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,786
Like how to make people excited about adventure games.

312
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:40,006
So I can't tell you right now.

313
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,859
Rice: I think we should have Majus animatic it up, too, just to see how long, Schafer: Animatic it up?

314
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,157
Rice: how long we're looking already.

315
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,607
Schafer: That's the first time I've heard that used as verb.

316
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,337
Rice: Animatic it up? Schafer: Yeah.

317
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,320
Petty: Here, I'll put some notes together and we can send it to Majus.

318
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:04,020
[Skype rings] Fietzek: Hello. Offscreen Voice: Hi, Majus.

319
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,940
Fietzek: So I really wanted to continue working in the Reds family.

320
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:15,000
and so I talked with Greg and talked to Tim and it worked out, which is cool.

321
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:21,385
But it's boring, of course.

322
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,010
It's not as exciting as an office, of course.

323
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:31,390
Because in the office, it's so much excitement, pitching something to Tim.

324
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:38,356
And here it's, you know, like I'm sending it out and then I have to wait.

325
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:49,271
And then there's an email and emails are great and lovely and all but I really miss, of course, the office and all.

326
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,597
Now I started working on the actual teaser trailer.

327
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,040
But I just started.

328
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,180
And I sent it to Tim and I wonder what he thinks.

329
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,160
Schafer: This is Majus' animatic.

330
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:42,380
[Music] Offscreen Voice: How do you like the trailer?

331
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,506
Schafer: I think it's going to be great.

332
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,780
It's, I mean, it's short but it's a teaser.

333
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,289
Rice: So, it's looking rad.

334
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:51,749
I think it's almost exactly what we're hoping for, so that's rad.

335
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,100
Oh my goodness.

336
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,500
This is the worst.

337
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,840
He had to go back to Germany.

338
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:15,008
Gardner: Basically the first thing that I'm doing when I do the layout for one of our, for any sequence, is I'll play it.

339
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:19,940
And I'll be like, OK, so that, I'm going to use that background for the Cloud Colony, that animation.

340
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,475
I'm going to use that background from the hole sequence, I'm going to use a floating animation.

341
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,337
That, I don't know how we're going to do but I'm going to figure that out later.

342
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:33,029
This one, I know Ray is animating so I'll just, as soon as he's done, I'll just throw in his animation.

343
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:37,489
Crook: So that's one of the shots that's in the, it's going to be in the trailer.

344
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:43,718
So we'll be able to take the work that I've been doing, which is all game play stuff.

345
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,640
And we'll just do a slight custom version of it to match up with the animatic.

346
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:56,812
'Cause sometimes, you know, Majus will do the animatic and it just isn't the way that it plays out exactly in the game.

347
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,120
And so we'll just customize it a little bit.

348
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,280
So some of it might get thrown out, but most of the art I think we could keep.

349
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,955
So it won't be a total, like waste, in that sense.

350
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:17,084
So that's usually the trailers work, right in there, you're trying to create an overview of the game,

351
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,440
even though a lot of it's not even done or even started on.

352
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,838
Offscreen Voice: So Eliot's on the team for a little while.

353
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,391
[Applause] Roberts: I've been secretly working on the trailer for the past week.

354
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,720
Offscreen Voice: Commercial?

355
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,381
Crook: That's what you were talking about, this is what you wanted.

356
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:41,479
The girl to be thinking during this.

357
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,690
Schafer: It's like, yes, she's apprehensive.

358
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,490
She's like is this really the right thing for me to be doing?

359
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,030
Everyone's so happy but I'm like, Rice: I think it's good.

360
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,132
Crook: Is the head scratch too obvious or not?

361
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:55,042
Schafer: No, I mean, if anything, it's a little, I mean, I guess, I was only worried about reading as a head scratch

362
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:56,954
and not a finger in the eye, but.

363
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,046
Roberts: And Tim's vision, that, that always helps because he, he knows his characters so well.

364
00:24:02,046 --> 00:24:09,439
Where like working on effects, you work with some directors that have no idea how to interpret animation,

365
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:16,035
so you show them a shot and they're just like, they give you some random note and they're just like, I, I don't really know what to say about this note,

366
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,551
because I don't know what I'm looking at.

367
00:24:18,551 --> 00:24:24,624
I'm not looking at a finished product and I know what my character should be doing, but I don't know how to express that.

368
00:24:24,624 --> 00:24:27,444
And it's surprising how many directors out there are like that.

369
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,478
But Tim is different because he, he knows his characters so well.

370
00:24:32,773 --> 00:24:40,327
And he would give notes sometimes that I'd, I remember going into Brutal and getting a note and thinking like, that's crazy.

371
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,891
I don't think that note's going to work.

372
00:24:42,003 --> 00:24:45,368
Like that, like Eddie shouldn't be doing what, with that.

373
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:47,201
And so I, but you know, you have to go animate it.

374
00:24:47,201 --> 00:24:50,617
So I went and animated it and it totally worked.

375
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:56,735
It was just like totally looked good for what Eddie Riggs was doing, because he knows his characters that well.

376
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:58,577
And it's a really awesome thing.

377
00:24:58,577 --> 00:24:59,237
It's really rare.

378
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,680
Schafer: Thank you, Elliot.

379
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,120
I'll come back in tomorrow and change everything.

380
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,440
Schafer: So much pressure walking down the hallway, 'cause of the camera.

381
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,620
Yeah, out of here, JP, get. Go.

382
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,460
LeBreton: But I'm taking this file cabinet and these bananas with me.

383
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,183
Schafer: It's like "The Jerk" You're like Steve Martin.

384
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,781
Get out of here ack mac.

385
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:31,861
Off of Red's with you.

386
00:25:32,806 --> 00:25:34,806
Rice: Yeah, we lost JP.

387
00:25:34,806 --> 00:25:37,907
And he had to go to another project.

388
00:25:38,157 --> 00:25:40,274
Offscreen Voice: Do you feel like you got to make any contributions to the game?

389
00:25:40,274 --> 00:25:41,354
Were you there long enough?

390
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,745
LeBreton: To Red's?

391
00:25:43,182 --> 00:25:46,172
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, yeah.

392
00:25:46,172 --> 00:25:49,025
Just, you know, in a small, you know, yeah.

393
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:53,888
It might be slight, you know, in the grand scheme of things, 'cause like, you know, there's still a bunch of game to make.

394
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:02,260
But yeah, I feel like I got to be involved and got to know the team, the specific team culture.

395
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,991
Offscreen Voice: Brandon had to leave, too.

396
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,000
Schafer: Brandon had another project that needed him and he's going onto that.

397
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,775
Schafer: I'm out tomorrow so this is our last dailies with you.

398
00:26:15,338 --> 00:26:17,398
Good having you.

399
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:23,683
Dillon: Yeah, this is actually the second game at Double Fine that I've worked on that I've left before it was finished.

400
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,446
So yeah, that's, that's always, I think that's where the melancholy comes from more than anything.

401
00:26:29,446 --> 00:26:32,897
It's just sort of like, you know, you want to kind of see things through to the end,

402
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:38,268
but my general feeling is that I'd like to work on whatever is the most important thing for me to work on.

403
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,590
LeBreton: But I think it goes to show that, you know, like we're a multi-projects studio through and through at this point.

404
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:49,376
And that, you know, we can't, putting all of our eggs into one basket, even if it is a very high profile basket, that you know,

405
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,253
that a lot of our reputation is riding on, you know.

406
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:58,128
It's kind of like, well, Red's, Red's is definitely the future of the studio, but all these other things are, they're sort of further future,

407
00:26:58,128 --> 00:26:59,960
further into the future at the studio.

408
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:09,630
'Cause hopefully, you know, yeah, what we're obviously all hoping for is that Red's comes out and really fulfills the promise of the original Kickstarter.

409
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:16,186
Because the Kickstarter backlash has begun in earnest, you know, and people are saying like, oh, you know, like these guys, you know,

410
00:27:16,186 --> 00:27:20,200
what they have, are they, you know, are these, is this team ever going deliver?

411
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,200
Is this team, we haven't even heard from this team and whatever.

412
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:31,403
So I think, you know, the people who can make that work, the developers who can make that work and the ones who can't are, there's going,

413
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:34,883
those packs are going to break apart pretty soon if they haven't already.

414
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,700
So, yeah, so yeah, we'll see.

415
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:52,920
[Music] Schafer: All right. Red's.

416
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,620
Oh yeah, Red's.

417
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,980
I've got to name that basically today or tomorrow, really.

418
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,480
And I mean, names change all the time.

419
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,220
Muir: Top three, top three.

420
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,906
Schafer: No, no.

421
00:28:08,906 --> 00:28:12,106
Not going to, Muir: Bottom three, bottom three.

422
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,566
Schafer: We're working on it.

423
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,126
Top people are working on it right now.

424
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,120
We also recorded live music this morning.

425
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,072
Brian went and recorded music for the trailer.

426
00:28:21,425 --> 00:28:22,705
That go OK, Brian?

427
00:28:22,705 --> 00:28:24,005
Min: It was nice. It was very cool.

428
00:28:25,591 --> 00:28:45,520
[Music] McConnell: That was beautiful.

429
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,020
I think that's our take.

430
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:51,900
[Music] [Tim Hums along]

431
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:07,420
[Monster roar] Schafer: The one that seems a little out of place is the monster, Maiden's Feast one,

432
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,040
'cause it seems like it's scored.

433
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,460
Could I hear just that part again?

434
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,820
Min: I mean, it sounds pretty cool to me.

435
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,060
We could certainly bring that down if it's a little overpowering.

436
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,940
Schafer: I guess what really jumped out is being different than the rest of it, you know what I mean?

437
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,252
I like the rest of it, but just that first, that first.

438
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,744
Min: Yeah, yeah, we could, Schafer: That was crazy.

439
00:29:37,744 --> 00:29:38,709
I love it.

440
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:39,929
Awesome. Do it.

441
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,804
Min: I'll send that out to you and then you can check it in your box and listen to it a few more times.

442
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,280
Min: Thank you, Cam.

443
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,266
Stoddard: I want to make sure I get this right.

444
00:29:52,266 --> 00:29:56,740
So the call of the beast he wants up a little and the music down a little, is that right?

445
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,036
Min: No, I think we should just leave it, because it sounds awesome.

446
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,922
We'll just bounce out this version and then Tim's going to, he's going to obsess over it anyway.

447
00:30:03,922 --> 00:30:06,502
He's going to just listen to it like five, six times.

448
00:30:06,502 --> 00:30:09,187
And then if it really bothers him, he will tell me.

449
00:30:09,187 --> 00:30:10,707
So I think it's fine.

450
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,222
Camden: The thing I like most about this trailer is the dynamics.

451
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,080
The fact that there's quiet and soft parts.

452
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,598
That kind of stuff is rarely seen.

453
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,958
In fact, a lot of times in audio you're really tempted to have everything the same.

454
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,729
Like in the same kind of perspective audio-wise.

455
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:37,296
So like that stuff, like it's rare to see a game trailer that quiet.

456
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:44,392
And so I'm really interested to see how this is received, because it's very out of the cut.

457
00:30:44,706 --> 00:30:47,006
So I'm, it's very Tim.

458
00:30:47,006 --> 00:30:55,012
I love how tied in that is, because Tim is, like the central theme is like kind of coming into your own and breaking out of the routine

459
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,761
and really kind of fighting for your creative soul.

460
00:30:57,761 --> 00:31:00,137
He's like, I got to hand it to Tim.

461
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,289
When he makes a story, like it's in there.

462
00:31:02,617 --> 00:31:03,377
It's deep.

463
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:08,640
And I had a lot of fun, kind of trying to find the audio voice of that.

464
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,480
Schafer: It's going to be awesome.

465
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,315
Petty: New music in and you can take a listen and if there's any last things you want, let me know.

466
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,520
Schafer: Cool. Exciting.

467
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,938
Offscreen Voice: It's almost done?

468
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,384
Petty: Yeah. Like anything, you know.

469
00:31:29,384 --> 00:31:33,624
So this is the way games or trailers or art develops.

470
00:31:33,624 --> 00:31:38,242
It's like you start here and this is where you want to be and you go whoa!

471
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:44,686
And then you go, I'm going to spend some undetermined period of time right here getting this last five to ten percent.

472
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:49,326
So really, yeah, we're in that kind of, we're close to that.

473
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:55,680
Ryken: I just saw so many glaring things with the textures that I was like, God!

474
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,415
If we're going to work on these guys, we're going to do it now for this trailer.

475
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,800
Just get them as close to where we want them to be, yeah.

476
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:08,404
Petty: Levi's gone back and touched up some of the, sort of uses it as an excuse also to go in and tighten up some of the earlier paintings.

477
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:12,231
So the girl's actually been completely repainted, as has the boy.

478
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:19,338
But I mean, it's still the same design and everything, but they're just tighter now and I think will pop off the background a little bit.

479
00:32:19,653 --> 00:32:22,813
Something that a lot of us talked about for a while.

480
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,973
Petty: So the, you know, when we, I think we have been with this very thin characters.

481
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,040
And I think that makes them, of course, harder to read.

482
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:41,392
And the other thing was the very first environment that we chose to polish has an analogous color scheme to the main character in that environment.

483
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,352
Team Member: Yeah.

484
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,820
Petty: A peach-colored thing, but that she's also peach and pink.

485
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,440
Roberts: That's where it first stood out to me.

486
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,720
Gardner: Yeah well done, Master of Color.

487
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,605
Stapley: I like pink.

488
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:53,617
I like pink. I like pink.

489
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,480
It's your fault.

490
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,880
Gardner: Fuck you!

491
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,700
Stapley: Fuck you man. With your anime shit.

492
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,521
Ryken: I'm excited for this.

493
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:08,297
I think we came a long way figuring out the potential for what all of our scenes can look like with the trailer. Yeah.

494
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,400
Just finding something we're happy with. Yeah.

495
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:18,711
Choy: Like for example, this Maiden Feast scene was one of the very first scenes that was kind of put together

496
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:26,551
before the sort of art work flow pipeline and tools were even like, were even set.

497
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:34,620
So, so going back to this one it was actually like, it was like, whoa, we've come a long way, 'cause it was like organized differently

498
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:40,000
and there was a lot of things that could be adapted to like the new workflow.

499
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:46,626
Stapley: In a way, it seems like we're kind of grabbing from this point, you know, and this point and this point and this is where we are now.

500
00:33:47,073 --> 00:33:49,813
But I mean, like where we are now, it's awesome.

501
00:33:49,813 --> 00:33:51,918
The trailer looks fucking sick.

502
00:33:51,918 --> 00:33:53,521
I think everything's awesome.

503
00:33:53,521 --> 00:33:56,181
So yeah, I'm more stoked on this system.

504
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:59,092
Offscreen Voice: It seems more like what Tim envisioned.

505
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,720
Stapley: Yeah, I hope so, I hope so.

506
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,884
Stapley: If everything with the game could look like that final shot then, people are going to shit, yeah.

507
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,246
Schafer: Yeah. Seeing some of the final stuff, like that final piece of key art when Bagel drew it, it was beautiful

508
00:34:13,246 --> 00:34:17,218
and it just made me feel really good about how beautiful the game is going to look, you know.

509
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:21,192
And all the shots in the trailer are looking really good, especially when you see like the key art

510
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,037
and how it looks like the original doodle I had in my notebook.

511
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,980
It's like OK, this is exactly what I kind of imagined it being from the beginning.

512
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,279
Petty: Logo. It's not there yet.

513
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,020
Schafer: God, what would go there!

514
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,103
The issue is you're always waiting for the perfect name to just pop into your head and it was just time to like, like we got to do it.

515
00:34:51,103 --> 00:34:57,317
'Cause in some ways it's kind of silly, 'cause names don't matter in some way as much people think.

516
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,160
Like as much as you think in the moment when you're trying to come up with the perfect name, you're like, oh, that's not perfect.

517
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,600
Schafer: Today's the day when the name is due in the game.

518
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,040
Ah, do you want to see my newest charts?

519
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,548
So this is just the latest one.

520
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,760
It started here.

521
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,807
I'm getting into four columns, I don't waste paper.

522
00:35:21,137 --> 00:35:22,337
Here' another one.

523
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,880
And that, and that.

524
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,160
I can't delay it anymore, I wish I could.

525
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,680
I wonder if I can get away with delaying it?

526
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,440
That Game Informer guy will be really mad.

527
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:44,768
So will Greg, because it's dumb to put it in the trailer and announce the game with a code name.

528
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,249
Ah, I should pick something.

529
00:35:47,249 --> 00:35:48,830
What's the least offensive one?

530
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,980
Probably Broken Age.

531
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,980
Schafer: So try on this name, Broken Age.

532
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,835
Well, we're announcing with the game Broken Age.

533
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,140
And I think, I think it's a good name.

534
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:10,909
It stands for the broken era in which these kids live and their awkward age that they live in.

535
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:13,111
And how they're breaking out of these cycles.

536
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,702
So I think it's definitely an appropriate name.

537
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:20,448
And it's really hard to tell if it, like if it, 'cause it's always going to feel a little weird to change names like this.

538
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,100
And so I'm saying we just put it on and walk around with it.

539
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,051
And learn to love it.

540
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,762
And if we learn to hate it, we'll just change it.

541
00:36:29,762 --> 00:36:32,062
We've changed names before and no problems.

542
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,697
No big deal.

543
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:41,620
But I think it's a very promising name that in two months we'll either head over heels in love with it or we'll have a different name.

544
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,940
So, so that's the name of the game.

545
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,411
Stapley: You guys like the name? Yeah, yeah.

546
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,869
Yeah, we were talking about it yesterday.

547
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:53,749
I was like, I remember when we thought that the name Red's was weird.

548
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,274
The nickname was weird.

549
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,041
We're like Red's? But now it's Red's.

550
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,401
Like, we didn't think about it.

551
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:02,441
So that's probably going to be the same thing, maybe.

552
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:12,146
Petty: Going back through all the scenes that we made some advancements in for the trailer and pulling in some of those changes.

553
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,126
Then I'm off to GDC.

554
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,460
Schafer: Hey, Scott Campbell!

555
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,440
Oh it's his dad too.

556
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,320
That's awesome.

557
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,640
One second. Hey, Scott's dad.

558
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,040
Schafer: Hi, have you been here before?

559
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,960
Scott's Dad: Oh, I sure have.

560
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,920
Schafer: Welcome back. You've been here many times.

561
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,239
Scott's Dad: Soon after you moved, first moved in.

562
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,580
Schafer: Oh my gosh.

563
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,080
Hey. What are doing?

564
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,140
What are you guys doing?

565
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,420
Campbell: So hey, is this for you, it's for Molly, right?

566
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:51,900
All right, Molly.

567
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,720
Schafer: So yeah, yeah.

568
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,260
I don't know what else to say, this has been the month of just doing too many things.

569
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,840
Being really overloaded with stuff.

570
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:11,088
Hopefully next month will be, well, I can focus on design and writting stuff instead of all these extracurricular activities.

571
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:34,420
Schafer: Tonight's winners, tonight's winners were chosen in an open nomination process by 700 of the world's top game creators.

572
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,555
Afterwards I hope the team is all excited because it's our trailer being cheered at for the first time and everyone's going to be jazzed

573
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,740
so we'll all go out to dinner, hopefully.

574
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,869
And celebrate.

575
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,920
And that should be really a lot of fun.

576
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,194
Unless people boo.

577
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,480
If people boo at the trailer then we'll probably be drinking a lot more than eating.

578
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,311
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen.

579
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:28,110
We are pleased to begin the second half of our evening and welcome you to the thirteenth annual Game Developers Choice Awards.

580
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:35,389
Please welcome the host of the evening, President and CEO of Double Fine Productions, Tim Schafer.

581
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:45,720
[Applause] Schafer: Hello, everybody. Hi.

582
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,148
Wow. This podium is…

583
00:39:49,148 --> 00:39:50,191
Schafer: It's great. I mean, it's so weird.

584
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,381
It's so different than any other video or anything they're going to show tonight.

585
00:39:52,381 --> 00:40:03,604
You either have goofy mega-64 videos, you have these amazing triple "A" crazy games and then you have this little hand painted Bagel thing coming out there.

586
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:10,176
I think people will like it. Who knows.

587
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,060
Schafer: I'm not sure if you heard about this, but a little while back we did a Kickstarter project.

588
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,240
A game and a documentary.

589
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,371
And we usually, we just keep this stuff just for our backers.

590
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,773
By the way, is there, are there backers here in the audience tonight?

591
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,800
Any backers? Yes!

592
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,645
Please raise your hand if you're a backer.

593
00:40:27,645 --> 00:40:32,602
Thank you backing and now please put your hand in front of the eyes of the non-backers seated next to you.

594
00:40:32,602 --> 00:40:35,242
For what we're about to show, please enjoy.

595
00:40:36,431 --> 00:41:42,250
[Music] [Cheering and Applause]

596
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,482
Schafer: Did you see the trailer?

597
00:41:45,482 --> 00:41:46,543
What'd you think of the trailer?

598
00:41:46,543 --> 00:41:47,441
Looked good, huh?

599
00:41:47,441 --> 00:41:51,621
It's great to have this huge payoff, like you don't really often get to crunch in games

600
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:55,301
and make something and then hear people cheer for it, so that was great.

601
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,627
We're going to go to Fang, I think, and all have dinner together.

602
00:41:59,627 --> 00:42:01,787
And then see where the evening takes us.

603
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,134
Right? Right? We're going?

604
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:05,949
Rice: Yeah, we gotta go.

605
00:42:05,949 --> 00:42:07,149
Schafer: Let's go right now. OK, bye.

606
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,389
Wait, I got to find my wife, hold on..

607
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:38,960
