1
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,704
Schafer: Hi, guys. How's it going?

2
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,406
This is the last one of these we'll ever do?

3
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,607
Offscreen: Yeah.

4
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:45,546
Schafer: Seems like only yesterday I was saying all that stuff, sitting in this chair

5
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,248
that I can't remember now, 'cause it's been so long ago.

6
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,550
Offscreen: Mm-hmm, we talked about that initial budget in that chair.

7
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,552
Schafer: Don't bring that up.

8
00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:00,594
[Laughter] Yeah, it's just-- it's this one,

9
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,296
and then it's, ahh!

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:30,590
[Music] Schafer: Tonight, we are going to have a bonfire down at the beach

11
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,461
to celebrate the completion of "Broken Age," everybody.

12
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,164
[Applause] Yay!

13
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,532
Teamwork!

14
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:41,368
It started out like a really fun idea, and then it got really hard.

15
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:45,505
And a bunch of people wussed out, but a lot of people stuck around to the end.

16
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:52,079
I wanna thank you, thank you to the whole team, and thank you everybody.

17
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,513
We're done!

18
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:57,851
Like, we went to the beach, we had that party, things got a little out of control.

19
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:02,856
[Yelling] And it's fun, it's fun 'cause it's, like,

20
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,591
not fixing things right at the last minute.

21
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:09,997
We kinda had it done in advance a little bit, at least for-- for me and us.

22
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,732
Like, it was, um, wrapped and submitted.

23
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:15,202
Like, we had to submit for the disc version, and that kind of actually-- it was tough,

24
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:19,272
but it forced us to have a lot of stuff done before the, um, actual launch date,

25
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,442
'cause we had to have that version burnt to disc.

26
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:28,448
And so, um...we had to time to kind of, like...

27
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,584
adjust to the thought of it being over.

28
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,420
Um, so, Reds is done and it's awesome.

29
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,656
The end.

30
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,556
Rice: It's done?

31
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,591
Oh my God.

32
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,593
That's kinda sad.

33
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:44,765
We sent review keys out to press for "Broken Age," so there's already, like, 10 or so folks

34
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,767
that are playing for review.

35
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:50,570
With the amount of time that it's taken and the amount of things that have happened

36
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,840
in the last three years is, uh, staggering.

37
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,312
And, um, it was nice to see everyone care enough to push for a final product

38
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,448
that could be something we're proud of.

39
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:04,718
Crook: Um, so yeah, it just, um, it kind of all came together at the end.

40
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:09,022
Um...so I feel good right now.

41
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,724
Offscreen: You feel good about it? Crook: Yeah.

42
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:14,661
I think it's beautiful, and something that we should be proud of.

43
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,064
Uh, I think people are gonna really like it.

44
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,332
Russell: Yes, we're finished.

45
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,301
See, I knew it would happen.

46
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:25,672
And after 13, 14 years here, you know stuff's gonna get done,

47
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,575
and it'll be great in the end.

48
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,277
It'll be all worth it.

49
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,646
Schafer: Rusty. Russell: I'm playin' through and fixin' bugs.

50
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:33,780
Schafer: Well, thanks for playing.

51
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,215
Russell: Mostly playing. Schafer: Mm-hmm.

52
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,450
Awesome. What do you think so far?

53
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,617
Russell: I got confused, actually.

54
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,254
As much as I played through-- -I was-- Schafer: That's not good!

55
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,457
Rice: It's not a scripted cutscene, so you wouldn't know.

56
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,659
Russell: Yeah, exactly.

57
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:46,860
Schafer: Excellent, did you figure it out, or did ask for a hint?

58
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,061
Russell: I had to ask Ray.

59
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,763
Schafer: Oh... -Oh...

60
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,032
And also, look, it's running on, uh, iPhone 6.

61
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,467
-Thanks... Rice: Not anymore.

62
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,469
Schafer: Not--b-but--it's a black screen.

63
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,737
Oliver!

64
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,805
Oh, spoilers for "Act 2"!

65
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,873
Okay.

66
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,508
Anyway, it's running.

67
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,376
Franzke: But, yeah.

68
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:08,115
As you can see, the game is running a little thing-- This one just crashed, but it does work.

69
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:11,718
I am extremely proud of, you know, the product the way it is right now.

70
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,555
Um...and, yeah, I hope it will stand the test of time.

71
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:20,493
Schafer: And then we are on the street on April 28th.

72
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,195
It'll be awesome.

73
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,564
Um, and Anna's alive.

74
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:25,632
Look at that, everybody.

75
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,400
Yay, Anna's alive!

76
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,202
Yay!

77
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,637
Kipnis: It feels--it feels good.

78
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:35,842
It feels like, uh, we did-- we did something good and worthwhile

79
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:41,848
and something that hopefully will, you know, uh, have a-- I don't know, a future?

80
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,484
Like, have a legacy of some kind.

81
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:48,021
Schafer: I really, uh, felt good about the second chapter.

82
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,525
You know, I feel like it answered anyone's critique about the first one,

83
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:54,628
you know, without changing the game completely, you know.

84
00:04:54,628 --> 00:05:00,734
I think it definitely was, you know, harder and longer, and, um, and amazingly done in less time, so...

85
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:07,274
Stoddard: I did my first full, full playthrough last weekend, and it is a hard game.

86
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:11,077
It's really challenging and it's really well-done and it's engaging.

87
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:16,149
Like, I've worked on this thing for years and I still-- like, the story was still getting me.

88
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,284
It's pretty good.

89
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:20,687
And when I hit the final scene, like, man, dude,

90
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,622
it's, uh... it's cinematic.

91
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,624
It's like it hits you.

92
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,826
Definitely.

93
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,828
Um...so that felt good.

94
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,732
I just had to have a moment to...

95
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,467
start loving it again.

96
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,605
I mean, like, I had this point in here where, like, the love I have for this just kinda

97
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,774
got knocked out for a few days.

98
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,475
And that was really scary.

99
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,277
That was really scary.

100
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,780
And, um...

101
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,554
It was hard.

102
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,192
Schafer: We're going to our last stand-ups?

103
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,995
Is it last stand-ups?

104
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,663
I believe it is.

105
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,531
Hello, everybody.

106
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,500
Oh, look at the big-- Did we not get bagels for the final stand-ups?

107
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,070
Crook: Ah, I didn't try.

108
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,205
Schafer: Come on! It's our last one.

109
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,807
Get your ass off Bagel.

110
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,509
I brought this for emotional support.

111
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,645
In case I get emotional.

112
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,347
Crook: Just keep hugging it. Schafer: I'm not gonna get emotional.

113
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,315
Crook: Squeezing it, hugging it. Schafer: I doubt it.

114
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,284
I doubt it. We're not done.

115
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,852
Are we? We done?

116
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,153
Crook: This is the last standup.

117
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,188
Schafer: You playing right now?

118
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,522
This game is so addictive.

119
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,191
Cannot put it down for one second.

120
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:38,498
Um...this might be-- this is our last proper standup for the full team, but, uh...

121
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,500
don't worry, I won't give a speech or anything.

122
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,640
And then you always have this post-project depression, which is, like, you've defined yourself by who you are

123
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,644
by making this game for so long, and then it's over and you're like, "Who am I?

124
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,013
Am I not the person who makes 'Broken Age'?

125
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:57,817
What am I? What's the point of it all?" Crook: Before, when we were just doing, like, a big game,

126
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:02,555
it would ship, and then the whole studio didn't have anything to do for a while.

127
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,826
And every--I think every-- the whole-- You could kinda feel that in the air

128
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:10,063
and it just kind of-- it was just-- it was kind of a downer.

129
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:13,433
And, uh, because there's multiple projects now, we can all just jump onto things,

130
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:18,104
and that helps-- helps you, uh, I think helps me, get out of that.

131
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,374
And so that's why there was a need on "Day of the Tentacle."

132
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:25,645
Um, so now-- now I'm on to that.

133
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:29,015
Um, I'm--I hear it's really bad for people who are leading the project.

134
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,151
Uh, but Tim doesn't-- I mean, he doesn't show it.

135
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,386
He's pretty good with hiding, I think, his sadness.

136
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,455
But, um...

137
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,856
He's just sad all the time.

138
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,058
No.

139
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,860
Uh, but I'm sure he-- I'm sure it will hit him, you know,

140
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,065
because this is three years, uh, put into this.

141
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,232
Schafer: No, I don't get depressed.

142
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,702
I'm too old to get depressed.

143
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:53,406
Offscreen: Don't you have any sympathy for all the people that have been insisting the game will never finish?

144
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:57,243
Schafer: I do--I do feel bad for all the people who have based their identity

145
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,379
on the fact that I'll never finish this game.

146
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,482
'Cause we'll finish it and then they'll have post-project depression.

147
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,584
If I'm not that person who hates Tim Schafer, who am I?

148
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,119
Excellent.

149
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,620
Thank you. Panya's last standup, for sure.

150
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,521
Inversin: Yeah, for sure.

151
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,724
I'm out this week, guys, so it's been a pleasure.

152
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,326
But, uh, uh, yeah.

153
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,630
Crook: Go inside, Victor. You're next.

154
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,999
Schafer: Yeah, nice try, Victor. Crook: There you go.

155
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,268
Romero: Almost. -Schafer: All right, we'll miss you, Panya. Victor!

156
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,336
Crook: Yep. Schafer: Victor.

157
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,871
Romero: I'll miss you, Panya, uh...

158
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,807
Schafer: Oh, shipping games is always tense, and then afterwards there's this moment

159
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,643
where if there's ever gonna be any turnaround in the company,

160
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:34,013
it usually happens at that moment, 'cause people hang on to the--they want--

161
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,582
everyone wants to finish the project they're on.

162
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,817
That--so that's usually the period where people will come and go,

163
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,352
is--is in that period.

164
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:43,523
Okay, everyone, thanks for coming to dailies all those times.

165
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,591
It's over. Next project.

166
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,493
Rice: Yay! Crook: That's it.

167
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:47,627
Stoddard: Man, he's sentimental.

168
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,862
Crook: Yeah.

169
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,134
Coull: So.

170
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,669
Sad panda- I'm leaving.

171
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,737
Um...

172
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,508
What else do you want to know about it.

173
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,713
No, I mean, um, the contract was supposed to come to an end anyway.

174
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:12,719
The fact that it went on a month after was pretty-- pretty awesome for me.

175
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:18,091
You know, maybe they'll need me again in the future, but, you know, you can't be certain, I guess.

176
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,561
Schafer: Oliver is still cranking away on the final final versions of it

177
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,229
to get it out the door.

178
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,765
And then Oliver will be moving back to Germany, sadly.

179
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,034
I think some of you know this; we've talked about this.

180
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:32,705
Oliver is--the-- the--the pull of the fatherland is too strong.

181
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,707
He must go back.

182
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,176
Oliver wants to move.

183
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,245
He's gonna keep working for us, but he's gonna move to Germany.

184
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:43,716
But he's gonna be working on "Day of the Tentacle." So you don't have to be mean to Oliver.

185
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,653
That's the main point. Usually when someone's leaving, we make sure everyone knows in advance

186
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,122
so that they can be mean to them.

187
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,224
Franzke: So in a few weeks, I'm actually going to move back.

188
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,626
So it will be interesting to see how...

189
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,329
how much German culture has changed since I moved away.

190
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,198
Maybe I'll feel like a complete foreigner for a while.

191
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,833
Who knows? I don't even know.

192
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:04,337
So, all future interviews will have to be through Skype.

193
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,705
Offscreen: Gonna miss you, Oliver. Franzke: Yeah...

194
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:06,773
I'm gonna miss you guys too.

195
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,541
It's gonna be weird.

196
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,345
Schafer: I think it's-- it's been a tough time because we haven't, you know,

197
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,715
it's been a while since we've given raises to people, and so there's other companies in the area

198
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:20,720
that are making a lot of money right now, and so they're able to throw that kind of money around,

199
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,723
and that'll probably cause us to-- Uh, that always happens.

200
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:28,495
We lose through--when, like, Oculus and Facebook took off, they started throwing money around.

201
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,096
We lost some people to that.

202
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,366
Um, but after "Broken Age" comes out, we'll be able to throw money around, right,

203
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,504
'cause we'll be rich off of, uh, all those point-and-click adventure dollars.

204
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:40,206
Actually, we don't expect to make a lot of money off of "Broken Age,"

205
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,041
because everyone bought it the first time.

206
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:49,349
And, um, but the new platforms like, um, PS4 are going to be opening up some new customers.

207
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,618
Bailey: There's a lot banking on it, but--but not everything.

208
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,854
I mean, we diversified to do some of those LucasArts properties

209
00:10:54,854 --> 00:11:01,528
like "Grim Fandango" and, like, uh, "Day of the Tentacle." Uh, so "Grim" sales are really good.

210
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,496
Um, you know...

211
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:09,836
[Applause] It's, like, $1.7 million gross,

212
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,004
which is good.

213
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,107
So, across all platforms for the last week, um...

214
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,675
Schafer: I'm feelin' kinda gross. Bailey: Yeah.

215
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,711
And, you know, it looks like those are-- are gonna bring in a lot of, uh,

216
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,080
a lot of money for the studio, so...

217
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,084
Schafer: And I hope there's a lot of people out there who were just waiting for the whole thing to be one game

218
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,754
and don't care about crowdfunding and they don't wanna know about

219
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,689
our little transparency efforts.

220
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:35,028
They just wanna play a game when it's done and, um, hopefully they will buy it.

221
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,231
Please join me in welcoming Mr. James Spafford.

222
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,099
-Yay! -Thank you, guys.

223
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,035
James Spafford.

224
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,038
Uh, would you please stand up so everyone can see you.

225
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,440
This is James, and rotate one time.

226
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,175
No, you don't have to rotate.

227
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,476
Uh, James...

228
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,445
uh, welcome to Double Fine.

229
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:57,250
So James Spafford used to be one of the two people who ran Mixnmojo, which is an old LucasArts fan site,

230
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:03,756
and I knew him back then when he visited our offices in 2001, I think, and gave me some Marmite.

231
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:08,761
And, um...and now I said, "In 10 years, we'll hire you."

232
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:12,599
Fifteen years? "In 15 years, we'll hire you"-- as our community manager.

233
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,001
-Whoa. -He's not the new Chris Remo.

234
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,003
He will never be the new Chris Remo!

235
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,671
-Yeah. Muir: 'Cause he's not dead.

236
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,508
Schafer: In other news, Chris Remo's dead.

237
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,077
No.

238
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:28,648
Spafford: I mean, I'm a long-time follower of Double Fine and everything they've been doing.

239
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:29,782
I'm a backer.

240
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,352
Uh, obviously backed immediately.

241
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:37,290
Um, followed the documentary series, which I'm now on, which is really weird, uh...

242
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,192
Offscreen: Is he aware of everything that's happened?

243
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,526
Did he know what he was getting himself into?

244
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,829
Schafer: Don't tell him about gamergate.

245
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,631
No, he knows, he knows.

246
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:51,104
That's--that's the exciting new challenge for him, will be, um, rebuilding all the things.

247
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,505
Spafford: I knew what was going on.

248
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:58,044
I mean, certainly, lots of people were not happy about the game being split.

249
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:03,549
Um...so I feel like, yeah, that--that might've been the start of some troubles.

250
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:07,820
But probably the start of any community troubles was the day that the Kickstarter was made

251
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:14,193
and, um, $3.5 million was raised and a lot of people's money

252
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:19,599
was riding on a thing that they had in their head, a vision that they had that this thing was gonna be.

253
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:26,205
And, you know, it wasn't the way some people wanted it to be.

254
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:30,009
I never want to give up on people who are like, "You know, I'll try everything."

255
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,346
If people are really mad, a lot of the time you can--

256
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,682
you can--you know, you can bring them around.

257
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:39,352
There's always some way that you can make them happy again.

258
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:44,557
Um...yeah, it's just finding out what that is.

259
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:49,395
Schafer: It's--it's good timing, 'cause we're--as we're wrapping up the game, we're coming out of production

260
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:53,399
and getting back into all the community-facing stuff, like getting out the last of the backer rewards.

261
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,369
Like, we still have a lot of these little mini portraits that Bagel has to paint.

262
00:13:56,369 --> 00:14:00,406
So, like, it's come to that point where we're kind of, um,

263
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:04,777
closin' the loop on the story, big story, and so we'll be facin' the backers a lot,

264
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,613
and it's good to have a community manager for that.

265
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:18,291
Okay, so we're just--are we just talking about the launch plans for the game as far as PR and marketing?

266
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,226
What's--what's your marketing budget on the game?

267
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,294
Rice: Zero...?

268
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,762
Schafer: Okay.

269
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:26,199
Spafford: One of the big things I wanna talk about is how we talk about "Act 2"

270
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:31,204
and how we properly do this, like how we bring this thing out.

271
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,206
Schafer: How do we talk about "Act 2"? Spafford: The biggest thing, right.

272
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,741
Schafer: So just, like, the--what's it called?

273
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,343
Spafford: Well, like, no, as in...

274
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,645
how are you getting people to think about it?

275
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:44,517
You want people to think about it as a whole game, -or as episode two? Rice: Yeah.

276
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,787
Schafer: Like, now that it's done, I would like it to just be just "Broken Age,"

277
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,622
as if we never split it at all.

278
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:54,627
Rice: So, yeah, I think that the hope was, like, a year from now, the story would be more about just the game as it is,

279
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,763
not that it was split or anything.

280
00:14:56,763 --> 00:15:00,633
Spafford: When it was released, we did-- people did reviews of it and stuff, right?

281
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,470
Like, treated it like it was its own thing.

282
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:10,243
So I wonder how persuadable people will be to just forget that and move on.

283
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,379
Rice: But I still think we probably have to speak to the people who did already buy it, and--

284
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,682
Schafer: Yeah, because this is a worry that I do have, that people are like, "When's 'Act 2' coming out?"

285
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,519
And that they don't see that announcement, -"'Act 2' is out"-- Rice: Yeah.

286
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,189
Schafer: Like, the answer to that question, they might miss the fact that it came out.

287
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,791
Rice: Yeah.

288
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:29,829
Yeah, so I think we still need to be saying that, like, for people who purchased "Act 1,"

289
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:33,833
they're getting the full game now, updated with "Act 2" content.

290
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,202
Spafford: Yep. Rice: But...

291
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:41,374
Spafford: The PS4 and iOS is definitely a really good chance to just talk about the whole game.

292
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,676
So we've been trying to get people to play the PS4 version,

293
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:48,381
which is a new platform, um, and doesn't have that distinction.

294
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,383
Like, it's just one game on that platform.

295
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,718
So the more people we can get to look at that and talk about that,

296
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,822
the more-- the more hopeful we are that that can be a thing.

297
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:59,258
Rice: Not--not speaking to just, like, what's gonna happen in "Act 2," you know,

298
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:03,462
'cause that's how we've all been thinking about it for a long time, but speaking of, like,

299
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,564
what is this game?

300
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:07,533
Spafford: Looking at the full-- the full picture now it's done.

301
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:12,572
Other than that, we're just trying to, you know, beg, borrow, and steal every bit of coverage we can.

302
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,641
Rice: We were able to get a European press tour on zero dollars.

303
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,677
Schafer: I...w-well... Rice: So that's good.

304
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:18,778
Schafer: We're not paying anything for that?

305
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:23,382
Rice: Um, we are paying for three days of a B&B, but they're paying for all of our flights

306
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,285
and our B&B while we're there, so...

307
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,554
Um, I think it's all pretty set now.

308
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:32,625
So, um, flights and hotels and everything is in there.

309
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:37,597
There'll be-- basically we get to UK first for the first weekend,

310
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:41,734
and then the Monday after that we're doing, like, a bunch of press at Media Molecule.

311
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:49,108
Um, and we'll have Eurogamer, Edge, and The Guardian, uh, all that day in their offices.

312
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:54,614
And then, yeah, we have the talk in Vyborg with Peter and Ray.

313
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:18,503
[Music] Spafford: We should pick a day for having press around as well,

314
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,538
and then we can start organizing them.

315
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:29,649
[Music] Schafer: So what do you think so far, Marty?

316
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,750
Sliva: I think it's awesome.

317
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,320
Schafer: Give us your, um, full review now.

318
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,088
Sliva: Just verbatim, and then you guys can write it down.

319
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:41,193
Schafer: We need to know the score before we decide whether -you're leaving the room. Sliva: Yeah, okay.

320
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,697
Schafer: That's just a common-- Sliva: That's--that's happened-- That's happened before with other publishers, so--

321
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,499
Schafer: Really? They're, like... Rice: Oh, God.

322
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:50,503
Sliva: I think it's mostly like, like, "You can do an exclusive, but what's the score,"

323
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,239
you know what I mean? It's like, well, I'm not gonna do that, then.

324
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,509
Uh, everyone always says, like, "Oh, this is gonna be the adventure game

325
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:59,178
that gets people to play adventure games who haven't played adventure games."

326
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,579
Like, you--is that bullshit to you?

327
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,315
Like, is that-- is that necessary?

328
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:05,217
Do you think adventure games need that, -or do you think it's-- Schafer: I've always been--

329
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,653
I've always been interested in it, because it always seemed like

330
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:13,092
with adventure games that we were trying to get beyond the-- the limited audience

331
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,527
of people currently playing--playing games.

332
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:18,597
Not that they're limited, but there-- there was a, back in the '90s,

333
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:22,601
a small group of the culture at large that was playing games at all.

334
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,405
And it seemed like there are all these people who weren't playing games and they're like, hey,

335
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:30,509
I think you would like a game that, well, it's about story, where you don't have to worry about getting shot in the head,

336
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:34,647
and, like, you could play at your own pace and it involved themes that weren't

337
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,015
being covered in games, you know.

338
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:38,985
So we always, you know, we always, you know...

339
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,687
People would tell us, like, "This is the only game that my girlfriend will play with me."

340
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,656
And it was--that was always the story.

341
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:47,226
Like, there's all these people out there who, you know, why aren't they playing games?

342
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,061
And I think this is the game they would like.

343
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:54,734
But, um, you know, it's always been hard to reach those people, and, um, and make them feel like they would like--

344
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,870
You know, they think of themselves as someone who would not play video games.

345
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,873
It's hard to get past that identity problem, almost.

346
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,643
Sliva: Totally. Schafer: So I do think about it, but I don't think it's necessary.

347
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,812
Like, I think it's good enough to make a game that people--

348
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,347
and that's what this Kickstarter is all about.

349
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:12,151
Like, there are these people who said, "We like adventure games just the way they are."

350
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,654
And they don't need to completely revolutionize with--with how they interact.

351
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,989
They don't need to be a different genre.

352
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,292
They just, "We like the old adventure games and we wanna play another one."

353
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,729
And knowing they were out there and we were making the game for them, uh,

354
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,731
is what made it special this time around.

355
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:31,504
Rice: There's always been, like, conversation coming up here and there about how we're gonna give backers the codes,

356
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,340
or if we're gonna give them early access to the game or anything like that.

357
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,376
And I feel like it's never been, like, fully talked about and decided upon.

358
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:41,714
Schafer: I was--I wanted to give it just the--the day before, -the 24 hours before. Rice: Yeah.

359
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:46,619
Spafford: Yeah, if it's possible without too much mess, then I think that people will really appreciate it.

360
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,222
And in fact, we've set the embargo for press for the same time

361
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,492
as the backers getting their keys so that, you know, everyone's getting

362
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,494
their thing at the same time.

363
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,864
Offscreen: Yeah, 'cause the embargo thing was such an issue last time.

364
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,734
Spafford: I think there is all kinds of emotions about that.

365
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,636
Rice: Tim, did you hear that? Schafer: What?

366
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:09,742
Rice: "Digital Trends" posted an article, "Why We're Breaking the 'Broken Age' Embargo."

367
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:13,145
Schafer: Tell 'em maybe he didn't agree to anything, but he knows he's bein' a shit.

368
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:18,517
Bailey: I was looking over all of our news broadcasts, and basically all the exposure went out

369
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,753
when the backers got it, like, two weeks ago.

370
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:26,725
Spafford: I think that whole situation probably should have been done a bit differently.

371
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,496
I think we learned a lot from that, by the sounds of things, or at least I hope so.

372
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:35,434
And I've certainly watched that episode and--and thought, "Okay, we need to not do that."

373
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,606
Yeah, so, it--today is Friday.

374
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:48,180
Uh, on Sunday night, we're gonna send out backer keys to people, which is pretty exciting.

375
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:54,620
Um, 24 hours later, the game will unlock on Steam and be pushed out, uh, around the world

376
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,290
onto however many millions of platforms that we're doing.

377
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:03,362
Um, so by Tuesday, uh, morning when we all come into the office,

378
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:08,467
the game will be out, everyone will be playing, no one will have any problems, everything will be fine,

379
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,202
and everyone will be having a good time.

380
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,571
That's--that's the gist of it.

381
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,673
Hansen: Flawless. Franzke: What could go wrong, right?

382
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,642
Hansen: Yeah, don't say that.

383
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:17,676
Rice: It's all gonna be perfect.

384
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,112
Hansen: It--it may not be perfect.

385
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,381
Rice: Um, all right.

386
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,283
All right.

387
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,484
Let's put out the Kickstarter update?

388
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,719
Spafford: Let's do it.

389
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,622
Schafer: Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

390
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,825
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

391
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,665
Hi, everybody.

392
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:40,866
Hello, hello, thank you for waiting.

393
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,536
Thanks for-- sorry about the delay.

394
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:46,038
It's still so interesting, Melina just magically appears there.

395
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,640
Hello, Melina, nice to see you.

396
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,474
Awesome, awesome.

397
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,576
Okay. Hi, everybody.

398
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:55,347
Uh, today I've been very preoccupied 'cause "Broken Age" is in the hands of our backers

399
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,883
and people are playing it, which is amazing!

400
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,318
Yeah!

401
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,987
Offscreen: Do you wanna look at the forum right now?

402
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,389
Schafer: Okay.

403
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:05,124
Let's go to the forum, shall we?

404
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:08,494
"Spoiler: Need hint urgently." Ah! Ah!

405
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,528
Take that, right?

406
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,629
Right?

407
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,731
Where's the general...

408
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:16,468
"Let's talk about how much we love the game" thread?

409
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,636
Let's see.

410
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,605
Discussion and feedback.

411
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:20,706
"I finished this morning.

412
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:23,008
What an incredible game!" That's all I'm gonna read.

413
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,743
That's it.

414
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,580
"Everything about 'Act 2' has improved the game dramatically.

415
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,181
The puzzles are a lot more detailed.

416
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,384
Required me to pull out a notepad." Yay.

417
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,554
That's nice. I'm glad it makes-- I get excited when I pull out a notepad.

418
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,756
"I liked 'Act 1,' but it was a little linear.

419
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,458
'Act 2' is perfect.

420
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:43,028
And to Tim and everyone at Double Fine, I really appreciate you and what you've done so much."

421
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,263
Well, that's nice.

422
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:45,464
Ah! The game's out.

423
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,601
I mean, it really comes out tomorrow, or midnight tonight.

424
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:52,571
But it's out, the review embargo is lifted, we got a 9.2 from "Game Informer,"

425
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:56,642
and it should be good for launch, official launch day tomorrow,

426
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:59,612
where it'll be out on all platforms and everywhere.

427
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:04,316
Um, so now we just sit around and read reviews and pretend we don't care about 'em.

428
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:07,286
That's the...regular thing.

429
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:09,989
I'm gonna sit there, like, all night just waiting for them to come in.

430
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,691
You see one, you're like, "Oh, that-- that was awesome! I'm gonna read one more!

431
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,994
Oh, that was bad, I'm not gonna-- not gonna read any m--

432
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:18,631
Oh, that one was nice!" And then it all evens out.

433
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:22,301
I just was reading, like, two different reviews, one talking about being too hard

434
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,470
and one being, it's too easy.

435
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,607
And, uh, you know, that just seems to be the way with those games.

436
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,076
They're just, like, um...

437
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:37,316
people--people react strongly and very subjectively and, um...I don't know.

438
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:40,653
Like, I feel like it takes years, almost, for people to really decide

439
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:43,455
how they feel about these games.

440
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,791
So 10 years from now we'll find out if it was any good.

441
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,662
Offscreen: It seems a bit strange that there's review scores for "Act 1," "Act 2--"

442
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,063
And the whole thing.

443
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,465
Schafer: Yeah, it's a mess... it's a mess.

444
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,833
Never split your game in half.

445
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,636
Rice: By the way, there's a lot of people talking about it, so that's good.

446
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:01,307
Um, and tomorrow we're partying, and I think I sent an invite out to everybody.

447
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:05,511
So, bar crawl, I think we're just starting at Victory Hall, 'cause it's close and we can walk there,

448
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:08,547
and then we're gonna go-- Schafer: And then the hardcore. Rice: Chinatown.

449
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:14,553
Schafer: To people who care about history and wanna relive history through the bars of Chinatown and beyond.

450
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:19,658
Rice: So, tonight at 9:00 our time, midnight Eastern, is when all the other platforms will go up.

451
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,194
Bottle Opener: In the name of Lars Halford, open up!

452
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,529
Franzke: Okay, so we've got Ouya lined up.

453
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,798
I guess we just need to press that button.

454
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,166
Rice: The button?

455
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:31,070
Uh, Spaff figured out some way to wire this weird Divekick button...

456
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,572
Spafford: It's not that weird! Rice: ...to launching the game.

457
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,875
-Cheers. Franzke: Well, cheers to you guys.

458
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:41,413
Spafford: It's okay, we're toasting the five-- four-minute countdown

459
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,015
to pressing the blue button.

460
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,717
Do you want the blue pill, or the yellow pill?

461
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,552
Rice: Oh my God, everything explodes.

462
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:50,055
Franzke: The game gets deleted, obliterated from the server, so don't press the yellow button.

463
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,224
Spafford: All the money is refunded.

464
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,695
Franzke: The code gets unwritten, the art unmade.

465
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,131
Rice: Yep.

466
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:00,632
Spafford: What are we gonna do for four minutes, you guys?

467
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,569
We could read Twitter for a bit.

468
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,738
Spafford: People are really happy. Rice: The reviews have been -really good. Spafford: Yep.

469
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:09,808
Rice: Just, like, the way they describe the puzzles and the writing,

470
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,578
it makes it-- makes it feel like people actually really got it,

471
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:16,815
-which is nice. Spafford: We should get ready, because we're about to--to go into...

472
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,118
Rice: Let's do it, you guys.

473
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:22,454
Spafford: You should. Franzke: Okay, Greg, It's hovering over the button.

474
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,555
Rice: You do this one. Franzke: I do this one?

475
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,057
This is Steam; this is the big one.

476
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:27,626
Rice: I know. You do this one. Franzke: All right.

477
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:28,761
Spafford: Press the "Okay" button!

478
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,029
Franzke: All right, here it goes!

479
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,196
It's live on Steam.

480
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,598
Rice: Yay. Spafford: Oh, my God.

481
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,266
Rice: Okay. Spafford: All right, next one.

482
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,467
Franzke: Okay, here's iOS.

483
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,336
Spafford: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

484
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:39,204
Rice: Oh, man...

485
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,506
Franzke: All right, here, Spaff.

486
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,040
Franzke: Spaff, you do the OS X App Store.

487
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,308
Spafford: Release this version.

488
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,043
Franzke: Release!

489
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,645
I'll do Ouya.

490
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,646
Rice: Yep, there you go.

491
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:48,747
You're in that one.

492
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,315
Spafford: Ouya's live?

493
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,483
Franzke: Waiting--yep. Spafford: Okay.

494
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,584
Franzke: Just Google Play.

495
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:53,786
Rice: Okay, wait, is this the last one?

496
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:54,987
Franzke: Yeah. Rice: Let's all do this one.

497
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,221
Franzke: Okay. Ready?

498
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,190
Rice: Final build, one, two, three, go.

499
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:17,109
[Music] Franzke: But, yes, this is my last, I guess,

500
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,178
full day in the office, one could say.

501
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:22,347
Not that I'm actually gonna do any work, but, um...

502
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:25,384
Today is "Broken Age" launch day, officially.

503
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,219
Uh, so lots of parties lined up.

504
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:30,322
I am just gonna pretend they're all for me, for my leave--for one of my leaving parties.

505
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,624
Uh...but yeah, it's--it's weird.

506
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,626
It's weird. What is that? Oh.

507
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,495
Oh, because we don't actually need this anymore?

508
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:41,700
That's true, I guess I don't need to talk while-- Brr!

509
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,101
There's that.

510
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,575
All right?

511
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:53,579
Rice: We just put out the new trailer, so we're trying to, like, spread those around, um...

512
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:55,013
Offscreen: Elijah Wood? Rice: I did see that.

513
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:58,484
So Elijah just tweeted, like, thirty minutes ago about the game.

514
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:00,285
Right there, see? Boom.

515
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,587
Yay, Elijah.

516
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:05,791
Like you see right now, we're at, like, twenty-five or so on the list.

517
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:11,196
Um...and then the hope is that that'll start going up, so, by a couple things.

518
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,266
One is, we can check and see now if it's getting featured.

519
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,300
Okay, so there it is.

520
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,835
Yay. So this showed up.

521
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,303
So this'll help, especially since it's on sale.

522
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,538
Um, that's always nice.

523
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,473
On Steam people see that sale number.

524
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:26,578
We do get daily Android and iOS sales.

525
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:32,451
PS4 probably won't, uh, give us any kinda inclination for, like, a week or so, maybe, um, maybe more.

526
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:34,486
Spafford: They're the most interesting ones, I think.

527
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,088
Rice: Yeah, that'll be interesting, 'cause it's new.

528
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:41,026
Um...brand-new sales and it's reviewing well there and everything.

529
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:45,831
So, uh, I think we'll have a better idea in, like, a couple weeks across all platforms,

530
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:53,038
but we'll at least have an inkling of what to expect, um, from the ones that we can see soon.

531
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,376
It's just, those are the ones that we've already been out and being sold on for a while now,

532
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,144
so it's hard to say.

533
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,312
That's it.

534
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:01,647
Congrats.

535
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:03,615
Schafer: Uh...

536
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,217
Yeah, yeah.

537
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,020
Rice: You're so excited.

538
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,388
Schafer: Yep.

539
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,622
Phone voice: Press one.

540
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,991
To send a voicemail, press two.

541
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,660
Schafer: I don't know what hap-- why it did that there.

542
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,094
Phone voice: Home screen.

543
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:21,300
Schafer: Oh, man. Rice: Okay, all you'll do is say "Green," and then "Okay." Kipnis: Green and then--

544
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,001
Schafer: You press "Send" to accept the call.

545
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,203
Rice: Yeah, this is an old phone, old-school phone.

546
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,538
Kipnis: This is a really old phone, yeah.

547
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,640
It's--it's a burner we got?

548
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,542
Greg: Yeah. Kipnis: Is this what drug dealers use?

549
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,010
Rice: Yes, it's a drug dealer-- Schafer: Oh, I got a voicemail.

550
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,478
Okay, okay.

551
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,380
Phone voice: Home screen.

552
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,482
Kipnis: I love that it announces. Rice: All right, can we start?

553
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:41,820
Schafer: A hint line--we're talking about doing a hint line, getting a burner phone and just making it a number

554
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,089
that people can call for hints.

555
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:48,493
You're supposed to say, "Action." Maybe talking to me...

556
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,362
Hm.

557
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:54,766
I'll probably just be getting people angry, people calling to chew me out about "Spacebase."

558
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:58,070
Here's a hint: Go buy someone else's games.

559
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:02,374
Hi, and welcome to the Double Fine Hint Line, which we have had for a long time,

560
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,142
but no one's ever called, it's weird.

561
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:07,713
Uh, but we're answering calls today for "Broken Age," 'cause today is the launch of "Broken Age"!

562
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,247
Phone voice: Call one. Schafer: Oh, we got a call!

563
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,649
Hold on, everybody.

564
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:13,652
Hello, Double Fine Hint Line, can I help you?

565
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:14,987
Phone: Uh, hello, is this Tim?

566
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:16,088
Schafer: This is Tim.

567
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,255
How are you doing?

568
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,523
Phone: Oh m--oh, my God.

569
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:25,163
Hello, my name is, uh, Steve Kaufman, and I just wanna say, you are the greatest developers

570
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,199
in--in history, basically.

571
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,533
Schafer: Oh, that's so nice of you to say!

572
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,502
-Oh, that's lovely! Kipnis: Wow.

573
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:34,206
Phone: Uh, I was really happy as a backer to see it all come together.

574
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,508
Schafer: Aw, thanks for backing. Phone: So, I love it.

575
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:40,379
Yeah, um, and I actually have a legit-- like, I need a legit tip.

576
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,547
Schafer: Okay, all right, that's why we're here.

577
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:43,649
Kipnis: Wow, this is really working well.

578
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:46,585
Rice: There's a lot of people-- Schafer: Hello, Double Fine Hint Line, can I help you?

579
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:52,524
Kipnis: Maybe some--some asshole would call in and just say really mean things to us, live on the stream.

580
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:54,259
But it was, like, the opposite.

581
00:29:54,259 --> 00:30:00,499
It just, like, it completely blew our expectations, in the similar way that seeing the game get funded did

582
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,833
on that first day.

583
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,703
It made you feel like the world is a much better place than you thought it was.

584
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:06,138
Schafer: Bye. Phone: Goodbye.

585
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,373
Schafer: What a lovely fellow. Lovely fellow.

586
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,508
-That was spoiler-free. -Yeah. There we go.

587
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:12,244
Spoilers: Uh, our backers are great.

588
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:15,313
Phone: This is Emory Biloski from, uh, Israel calling, actually.

589
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,049
Schafer: You're calling from Israel?

590
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,550
What time-- what time is it there?

591
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,851
-Isn't it super late there? Kipnis: Shalom.

592
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,554
Phone: It's, uh, it's like 1:30 in the morning.

593
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:23,989
Schafer: Shalom.

594
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,724
Hello, Double Fine Hint Line, can I help you?

595
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:26,825
Double Fine Hint Line, can I help you?

596
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,527
Rice: Blowin' up, blowin' up.

597
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:30,729
Schafer: Hello, Double Fine Hint Line, can I help you?

598
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:31,830
Phone: Oh, shit.

599
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,465
Uh, hi.

600
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,500
Schafer: Language!

601
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,136
Kipnis: Yeah, it was just-- it was a really pleasant surprise,

602
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:42,407
like, just how lovely everyone was and, like, how fun that whole day--

603
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,544
that whole day was really amazing.

604
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,145
Spafford: That's it. We're done.

605
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:50,215
Kipnis: Yay. That was-- that was a great last call.

606
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,584
Rice: Well, we might turn the phone back on later.

607
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,419
Kipnis: Really? Rice: So, you never know.

608
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,456
Schafer: While we're hangin' out, just out in the bar later?

609
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,691
All right, let's get this good time over with.

610
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,159
Woo!

611
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,862
Nothing seems to happen until I stand up and get everyone's attention

612
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,030
and then say thank you to everybody.

613
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,264
I've made so many toasts.

614
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,467
Peter McConnell's here, everybody.

615
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:09,768
Peter McConnell. Nice to see you.

616
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:11,169
Thank you for all the excellent music in the game.

617
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:12,637
McConnell: Well, thank you.

618
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,640
When you've worked on something for--for a good long time,

619
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,644
you know, over two years, you know, two and a half for me, three I think for the--

620
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:27,419
for--for the--the team at large, um, uh, it's hard not to be, you know,

621
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,221
a little misty-eyed about it.

622
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:34,726
It's-it's like getting to the end of the game, when you play the game, um,

623
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:38,797
where--where you have to, um, say, oh, well, you know, these characters

624
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:43,435
have become my friends and--and now I have to say, you know, goodbye to the story

625
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,170
and goodbye to the characters.

626
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,773
And so there's a certain amount of sadness, I guess.

627
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:52,310
And--and, uh, certainly, um, you know, there's a little relief.

628
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,448
It's always nice to be-- actually to say, oh, finally, you know?

629
00:31:56,448 --> 00:32:02,187
Um, you know, but there's also that, oh, well, you know...

630
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,256
I mean, that's...

631
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,792
that's like, uh...um...

632
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:09,561
It's, uh, an--an era, you know?

633
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:14,666
A really big project like that, you love like--like a-- like a child.

634
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:19,504
And, uh, letting it go out into the world is a--is a-- is an emotional moment.

635
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:20,705
Schafer: Call me if you need any hints.

636
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,274
If you need any hints, give me a call.

637
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,508
All right.

638
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,477
Now, then...

639
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:31,583
[Gasps] Agh!

640
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,556
[Laughter] That's what you get for being cute!

641
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:40,659
TV: Oliver, safe travels and best of luck for the future.

642
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:46,431
And everybody else, stay awesome, stay strong, and find joy in the things that you do.

643
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,465
-Bye. Schafer: Bye!

644
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,567
Kipnis: Aw...

645
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,135
Wow.

646
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,269
Schafer: Awww.

647
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,504
TV: "Broken Age" got released...

648
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:53,805
Kipnis: Oh!

649
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,507
Schafer: Majus!

650
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,876
TV: I'm so happy for all of you.

651
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,811
Congratulations.

652
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,715
You finished this work of art, and now everybody can see and play it

653
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,184
and it's wonderful!

654
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:13,592
[Laughter] Struggled with problems and obstacles.

655
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:18,597
Ups and downs are a normal part

656
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,566
of the whole project.

657
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:24,102
And you should embrace that.

658
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,470
It's part of it.

659
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:30,442
"Broken Age" is made out of the ups and downs.

660
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:35,413
I am really emotional right now.

661
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,616
I wish I could talk to you for real right now.

662
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:41,887
And hope I see you again soon in the future.

663
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:44,256
And, uh, let's make more games.

664
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:48,560
Let's show the world how the sausage gets made.

665
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,862
And, um, yeah.

666
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,464
I love you guys.

667
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:53,732
Crowd: Aw!

668
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:56,101
TV: And...yeah.

669
00:33:56,101 --> 00:34:00,338
Let's, uh, let's--we--we'll-- we'll talk in person, so let's not do this.

670
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:03,642
[Laughter] Schafer: Let's not let this get weird.

671
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,076
TV: Bye. Bye.

672
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,044
I love you.

673
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,479
Crowd: Bye, Majus!

674
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,813
Schafer: I mean, crowdfunding was so great, and is so great in a lot of ways.

675
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:14,185
Like, it's--the--the, um, the relationship you have with the community

676
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:18,489
and the-- and the nature of the money is so, um, perfect for what you wanna do,

677
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:25,096
do something creative and--and community focused without worrying about ties to people

678
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:28,166
who might wanna try to influence your game because they gave you money.

679
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:33,170
Um...it's--it's weird because it just happened to time out--

680
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:39,244
it happened to coincide with a weird phase of the Internet where everyone's super angry all the time and it just, like--

681
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,781
it was hard to be that open and transparent and give everybody--

682
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:47,319
It's like we opened up a little tray of, you know, bludgeoning instruments so that--

683
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:49,254
for people could beat us up with.

684
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,523
And then people picked 'em up and just beat us up with them.

685
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:53,224
And we're like, huh, that was an interesting experiment.

686
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:56,761
We probably shouldn't have given all those weapons to all the people who are mad.

687
00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:01,833
But, um, if that had not erupted at that moment, you know, maybe I would've thought--

688
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:05,403
'Cause at the beginning, the transparency was nothing but, like,

689
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,673
um, hugs and, uh, high-fives all around.

690
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:12,544
Like, everybody at our-- you know, our PAX meetups, like, that was our community experience,

691
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:15,413
was everyone just telling us how much they were excited about the game

692
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,082
and how much they loved us and everything.

693
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:23,088
And then when we announced the change in the schedule, just all that-- just people just--

694
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:26,591
it seemed like there was a big crowd of people just ready to-- just really super mad.

695
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:32,430
And if you Google, like, um, "'Broken Age,' broken promises" on the Internet-- which I do every night--

696
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,499
if you Google that, you'll see all these angry articles.

697
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:38,536
Not just from, like, random people on Twitter, but, like, these journalists who are like,

698
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:42,207
"They really let everybody down with this and they should really be sorry."

699
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:43,708
And, um...

700
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:47,379
and here we are at the end and we're shipping the game and it took a long time,

701
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,547
but it's everything we said we were gonna do.

702
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:53,518
Uh...and I want to mail all those people individually and be like,

703
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,988
"It's time for you to apologize about that article." But I don't think they feel like they were wrong.

704
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,557
I think they feel like-- that we still really messed up.

705
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,226
But, um, I don't.

706
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,194
I feel like...

707
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,296
I feel--isn't it great to know I've learned nothing?

708
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,132
But I feel like...

709
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:12,670
[Laughter] I feel, like, officially that--

710
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,141
I feel like I just need to make an official announcement that I don't apologize for anything,

711
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:18,043
because I feel really good about it.

712
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:21,146
And if we had shipped one day earlier, the game would've been one day buggier.

713
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:26,317
And, um, if we had shipped the game that the original $3.3 million paid for,

714
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:27,619
it would've been small.

715
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:31,122
And I like the game that we made instead, and we put a lot of our own money into it,

716
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,291
and I think I'm really, really happy.

717
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:37,595
This is the game, this is what the game kinda said that it wanted to be, about this size,

718
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,030
and we did a really good version of it.

719
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,666
And so I don't apologize for anything.

720
00:36:41,920 --> 00:37:38,857
[Music] Raz: He makes me laugh.

721
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:42,360
"And that's why it's called a game." Schafer: Yay!

722
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:49,134
[Applause] That's awesome.

723
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:52,504
Uh, even though you like basketball...

724
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:55,340
Burbank: We all have our faults.

725
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,474
Schafer: That's awesome. Well, yes.

726
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,642
Well, that's awesome.

727
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,677
Now, uh, congratulations, Gabe.

728
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,246
No speech?

729
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:02,747
Gabe: No. Schafer: Okay.

730
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:05,617
Oh...one more thing.

731
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:09,087
We have boxes of "Broken Age," actual boxes of "Broken Age,"

732
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:11,990
and we have enough for everyone here to get one!

733
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,091
Ryken: It's under our seat?

734
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,292
Schafer: What?

735
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,827
Look under your seat...

736
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:19,130
and that'll give me time to open this box.

737
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:25,303
Offscreen: Now that this is wrapping up, like, how do you feel about the whole experience?

738
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:30,742
Schafer: I wish I really knew right now if I could say 100% what I learned from all that.

739
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:35,680
'Cause some of it's still, you know, uh, too soon.

740
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,117
Like, uh, 'cause there's this part of me that's like, I just wanna not tell anybody

741
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:40,385
about what we're working on right now.

742
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:43,254
Like, I feel just kinda, like, so exposed that I just wanna be--

743
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:47,759
I just wanna have some secrets for a little while, just as a kinda break from that.

744
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:51,629
I had a pleasant trip down memory lane making an adventure game, but I remembered

745
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:52,764
how hard they are to make.

746
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:56,568
And, um, I don't think my next game will be an adventure game.

747
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,736
I wouldn't say I'd never make one again.

748
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:02,640
But in the end, I really-- I really think the team put together a beautiful game,

749
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,076
and that's what I'm most happy with.

750
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,344
'Kay.

751
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,480
Now, this is gonna be awkward in case this came out wrong.

752
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,586
This is a little light.

753
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:15,687
That's a different game.

754
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,322
What?

755
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:21,693
Whoa, -look at that. -Beautiful.

756
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:22,794
It looks beautiful, okay wait.

757
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:24,162
I don't believe it.

758
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:26,631
The design of this was supposed to have Vella on the bottom,

759
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,600
'cause her hair is touching the logo.

760
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,003
Not that I'm gonna complain, 'cause it's really awesome.

761
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:33,671
Okay.

762
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,306
I--I just have to demonstrate before you leave.

763
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,441
This is fantastic.

764
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:40,345
Let's see if it works; I've never tested this before.

765
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,780
Gah, no, it doesn't work.

766
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,148
Gah! Nope.

767
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,651
Let's see, how does it actually--?

768
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:49,320
Okay, get rid of this.

769
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,522
Whoa...

770
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:52,624
Very cool.

771
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:53,491
And that, and that?

772
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:54,592
See?

773
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,227
And then, oh...

774
00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:00,331
I want everyone to do that when you get your copy and fix it, okay?

775
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,673
[Applause] That is kinda funny, we did Kickstart this thing

776
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:11,242
and now it's actually a box in my hand.

777
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,844
Well, that pretty much ends this documentary.

778
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,646
And...scene.

779
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:17,548
I really hoped when it came out people wouldn't forget about

780
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,584
how it was funded and just kinda talk about the game.

781
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,320
But it seemed like every review had to talk about the development story,

782
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,856
and so that was part of the lore for a long time, still.

783
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:29,494
So I hope, um, five years from now when people talk about adventure games,

784
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,229
they can look at it as just an adventure game.

785
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:35,199
And so I think it'll be remembered well, and people can just kinda get over

786
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,468
the crowdfunding part of it.

787
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:42,473
Kipnis: I--to be honest with you, I'm not really sure how this whole thing is gonna be looked at in the end.

788
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,842
Um...

789
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:49,314
I--I guess, like, everyone has hopes for, like, a game when it comes out,

790
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:53,451
and I had certain hopes that, um...

791
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,820
maybe were not fulfilled, necessarily.

792
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:02,827
And, uh, and it has more to do with just, like, I really hoped people would love the game.

793
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:07,598
Um, and it's not to say that they didn't, but I kinda just, um--

794
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:14,605
I think there--there was a lot of controversy surrounding the game and the company

795
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,574
that I wish hadn't been there.

796
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:20,611
Like, I just wish it was...

797
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:21,579
I don't know.

798
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:24,148
Annable: It was a long, hard road, and it was very public,

799
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,218
and I feel like there were a lot of things that changed.

800
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:32,991
Um, and they weren't necessarily just because of "Broken Age" and its visibility.

801
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:37,795
I think the company is a different company now than it was three years ago,

802
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:41,599
and I'm trying to still figure out, why?

803
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,501
I don't know, are we just older?

804
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,537
Offscreen: Do you have any expectation of "Broken Age's" performance?

805
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:47,872
Annable: I don't know.

806
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:51,376
Bailey: And then...uh, talking about sales of "Broken Age,"

807
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:54,545
so, uh, sales on Steam, we had a feature spot.

808
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:58,383
Um, it acted more like an update than, like, a--a new push.

809
00:41:58,383 --> 00:42:03,988
Um, however, we got a feature on Apple, which is doing really well; about $25,000 a day.

810
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:09,160
Um, and then we also have, um, sales for, uh, Sony.

811
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,563
PS4, we had, like, $100,000 worth of sales, uh, over the weekend.

812
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,766
And it just got featured, so, uh, that's cool.

813
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:17,769
Schafer: My expectation-- my expectation of "Broken Age" in the end

814
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:19,570
would just be to break even.

815
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,707
I know it was kind of always like a Kickstarter, like, you plan on it--

816
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:27,612
Like, it's--the risk is gone of losing money on it, so you know you've broken even if you just make the game

817
00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:28,813
to that amount of money.

818
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:32,583
But we made it, like, twice as much, almost, as we got in, or more.

819
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:36,454
And so, um, we will just about make that back.

820
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:40,358
And the biggest change is that we don't need the publishers anymore, 100%.

821
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:43,795
You know, it used to be, like, there was no money in the world outside of publishers.

822
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:45,596
And I think crowdfunding's here to stay.

823
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:48,499
I think it's, um, hopefully gonna grow.

824
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:52,770
And in my dream-- my dream world, it would be big enough to fund AAA games

825
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:58,109
and it would be the way that we fund all games going forward.

826
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:01,379
So now when we're talking to a publisher, the deals are better.

827
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:04,849
We're asking for less money, but we're also not entirely dependent on them

828
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:06,584
to make payroll next week.

829
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,519
We're not like, "Please, we just--sign us.

830
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,523
We'll--we'll sign anything, we just gotta make payroll." It's like, okay, you gotta kick us in the teeth

831
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,358
once a month and all this stuff.

832
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:17,662
And now we only have to take good deals with people we like.

833
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:21,666
So we still work with publishers, but, um, it's different.

834
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:24,502
Because we're 100% in control.

835
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,872
Annable: Yeah, we're not...

836
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:31,476
we're not rollin' in millions of dollars.

837
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:35,880
I--I don't know if that would necessarily make us happier, though.

838
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,483
Schafer: You guys are the best.

839
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:40,485
Thank you for all your lovely audio.

840
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:41,853
And thanks for your beard.

841
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:43,488
Stoddard: It's kind of a milestone.

842
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:50,127
I think there's a-- there's a few things in general around gaming that "Broken Age," like,

843
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:54,499
really kinda did a push towards a new area.

844
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:56,634
And I like that.

845
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,871
Um, there's a whole bunch of stuff, like, we could've done differently

846
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,473
and, like, we definitely fell down in some areas.

847
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,308
But, like, so what?

848
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,843
Like, that's how you-- that's how you go forward.

849
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:10,014
Like, if you never fail, then you just aren't learning anything.

850
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:13,284
You're just... being boring, really.

851
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,554
Franzke: I think it was a huge success.

852
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:19,290
Without this project, who knows?

853
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:25,229
Maybe Kickstarter would have never been the prime platform for, you know, crowdfunded games.

854
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:31,002
I think it made it possible for a lot of other people to--to work on their dream projects,

855
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:33,404
so that's--that's pretty cool, yeah.

856
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:36,474
So overall, you know, I couldn't be happier, I really couldn't.

857
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:42,446
And, you know, the other day, um, the other day I went to just a random technology store

858
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:46,017
here in Germany, and--and we just, um...

859
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,252
walked by this little thing.

860
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:54,258
So, just have--to see this physical manifestation of all the work that, you know,

861
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:57,562
went into--into this game is, like, super awesome.

862
00:44:57,562 --> 00:45:00,231
Schafer: Hey, Ray! Good job. Crook: Has the soundtrack in there.

863
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,199
Schafer: Oh, I forgot to mention, it has the soundtrack in there.

864
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,503
Crook: I mean, I guess we did accomplish what we wanted to, which was to do this game.

865
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:08,773
And we--and we did that, and we--and we finished it.

866
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:14,612
I think what we did do that was the-- that I think was the most beneficial to everybody

867
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:21,819
was that we kind of cracked things open and we let people look inside of how things work.

868
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:28,492
And this maybe will help them to see how things-- uh, how difficult, uh, it is,

869
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:32,496
and how we're kinda lucky that anything even comes out.

870
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:36,467
Like, that any video games actually get finished, um, is kind of a miracle.

871
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:37,501
And--and so that's good.

872
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,804
I hope that-- that helps...

873
00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:44,208
I--I hope that helps people who are fans of video games and like playing video games,

874
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:49,080
it just helps them understand and have a little bit of empathy towards, uh,

875
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,616
those of us who are in this industry.

876
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:57,855
Um...you know, we're lucky to be in it, and I--you know, I'm grateful to be in it, um,

877
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:01,826
but it's not always easy, and--and it's-- and I'm glad that

878
00:46:01,826 --> 00:46:06,364
we were able to show that to people in--in an honest way, so it's kinda neat.

879
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:12,403
I mean, if Double Fine's not around in 10 years, let's just, say, um-- it'll always be rem--

880
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:13,804
like, it's out there now forever, right?

881
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:17,208
Once it's on the Internet, um, it'll always be there.

882
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:20,044
And so...so...

883
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:23,614
Double Fine will always be...

884
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,882
...around.

885
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:36,761
[Music] Stoddard: I think it was very positive.

886
00:46:36,761 --> 00:46:39,163
I think there was a lot of stuff that we really did contribute

887
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:40,598
to the games industry.

888
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:45,369
And...uh, and there's a lot of stuff that we sidestepped and, like, misstepped.

889
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,405
And we're trying to learn from that, too.

890
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:53,344
So, um, considering all that, I--going back and playing the actual game,

891
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:55,346
I actually think we did really solid work.

892
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:58,849
And I actually think it's, um...

893
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:01,719
I think it's a really good game.

894
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:05,189
I haven't really seen many reactions that are just blasé.

895
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:08,859
Like, it--it's usually a strong reaction, one way or the other.

896
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:14,765
And to me, in any art form, that's great.

897
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:18,202
Like, that means that it's provoking something.

898
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:21,472
And I think that's what this is about.

899
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:26,143
If, like, we did three years of work and there was all these trials and tribulations

900
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:30,815
and at the end somebody just went, "Meh," like, that would be crushing!

901
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,150
But it hasn't been like that; it's been the opposite.

902
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:38,556
Like, it's either really, really good or really, really awful or, you know,

903
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:41,592
very, very vocal, no matter what.

904
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:43,761
Great.

905
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:45,796
Then we did our job.

906
00:47:47,520 --> 00:49:42,200
