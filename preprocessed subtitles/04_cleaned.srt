1
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,328
Cambell: Hello? Schafer: Hello!

2
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,796
Cambell: It's open.

3
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,015
Oh, god.

4
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:51,618
How many flights of these stairs are there?

5
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,140
[Heavy breathing] [Coughs]

6
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:04,831
[Gasping] So out of shape.

7
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,234
Gonna die.

8
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:15,360
[Deep breaths] [Knocking]

9
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:24,284
[Wheezing] Cambell: Hi, dude. Schafer: Hi.

10
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,886
Scott Campbell. Cambell: You made it up the stairs.

11
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,188
Schafer: Do you wanna work on our adventure game?

12
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,124
Cambell: Yes. Schafer: Okay.

13
00:01:31,880 --> 00:02:04,291
[Music] Schafer: Ah, you wanna come to the stand up?

14
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,625
Crook: Come and do our stand up. We're gonna have it right here.

15
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,060
Cambell: You guys stand up for the whole thing?

16
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,395
Schafer: Come to our stand up. Cambell: Okay.

17
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,628
I kind of have to use the...

18
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:10,796
you know... Schafer: Nope.

19
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,165
Cambell: ...you-know-what first. Schafer: Nope.

20
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,467
Oh yeah?

21
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,701
We were doing stand ups when you were here.

22
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,136
Kipnis: Ah, Scott, holy shit.

23
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,038
Hey! Cambell: Hey!

24
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:20,640
Kipnis: Hey! Cambell: How are you?

25
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,376
Is this how you guys always do it, just standing in the middle?

26
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:26,079
Schafer: You stand in the middle and
then you close your eyes and you lean
and we pass the body around.

27
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,382
Rice: Good, how's it goin'? Cambell: Good, man.

28
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,617
Schafer: You know Brandon? Dillon: No, we haven't met before.

29
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,754
Schafer: Brandon, Scott Campbell. Cambell: Hey man.

30
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:38,592
Skillman: Oh man, we're being filmed. Man, this is so awkward, but it's nice to see you.

31
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,660
McGarry: Oh, it's on camera. What's up, buddy?

32
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,062
Good to see you.

33
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,664
Hackett: That's all we do around here is hug.

34
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,600
Cambell: Hey, buddy. Hug sounds good, man.

35
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,335
Muir: I never met Peter Chan in person.

36
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,470
McGarry: I never met him either. Crook: Really?

37
00:02:50,860 --> 00:03:07,554
[Murmuring] Schafer: Bap-bee-dee-bap-bup-ba-da, buh-bum, ba-da-dum-dum-dum.

38
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,223
Ya-da-za-ha.

39
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,527
Let's see, are we all here? Everyone here?

40
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,429
Hello, hello, everybody.

41
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,197
Hi, thanks for coming.

42
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,600
Uh, please join me in welcoming some special guests we have here today.

43
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,803
We have from--some out-of-towners.

44
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:26,740
We have Mr. Peter Chan over here, Peter Chan.

45
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,308
Hello.

46
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:34,147
[applause] Uh, we have Mr. Scott Campbell. Where's Scott Campbell?

47
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,149
There's Scott Campbell! Yay, Scott Campbell.

48
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,389
[Applause] And we have, uh, Nathan "Bagel" Stapley.

49
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,657
There he is.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,295
[Applause] Anyone else coming in from out of town?

51
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,796
Is anyone here? Great.

52
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:53,733
Um, we are doing, um, uh, an art jam for Reds.

53
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,869
Reds is the code name for our Double Fine Adventure.

54
00:03:55,869 --> 00:04:01,475
This last week, we did one of my favorite things, which was the art jam, which we got all our artists from across the country

55
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:08,048
here in this room sitting around one table just drawing and talking and pitching ideas back and forth.

56
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:13,019
And we had Peter Chan who has been working with me since "Monkey Island 2."

57
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,423
We have Scott Campbell, who's here since the beginning of Double Fine.

58
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:22,796
And Nathan "Bagel" Stapley, who, um, whose art is gonna be featured front and center

59
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:28,502
in the Double Fine Adventure, and who has also been here since the beginning of Double Fine.

60
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:33,573
It's good to see you guys, I haven't seen, you know, a lot of you in the office for a while, so it's awesome to have you here.

61
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:38,345
Um, people who don't know who these guys are, ask somebody.

62
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:42,749
[Laughter] Cambell: You know, I'm excited. It's like a total reunion.

63
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:50,323
The last time we were all together was, um, beginning of "Brütal Legend." Peter was--Peter's been on, I think, every one of his projects.

64
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:54,494
Chan: Here that, uh, hired me. Right here.

65
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:58,064
Gilbert: I hired more people in this industry than you know.

66
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:03,203
Chan: Tim and everyone was going, "We would like you to come back and help us out on this."

67
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:07,374
And that was the friendliest you've seen Ron right there, fellas.

68
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:14,848
To collaborate with, uh, these guys Ron and Tim again is, you know, is like the good old days, you know?

69
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,117
So I didn't want to pass that up.

70
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,085
Schafer: Art is obviously really critical to graphic adventures.

71
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:23,690
It's part of the defining thing of like, "Let's have an adventure game, but let's add not just text to it.

72
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,528
Let's actually show the world." And seeing beautiful worlds laid out in front of you

73
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,330
that inspire your imagination.

74
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:36,069
Your desire to explore them is such an important thing, 'cause they don't have, um, you know,

75
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:42,642
an RPG's progression drive, you know, or an addictive hook like collectables or something like that usually.

76
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:52,018
It's just the--the thing that pulls you forward and keeps you going is the-- the extent to which we've ignited your desire to explore.

77
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:57,824
So I was gonna go over the state of the game like storywise and what design there is on the game,

78
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:04,297
and then talk about, uh, art jam, too, a little bit, 'cause this is a little-- this is a little earlier than I think we did--

79
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:09,703
Like, when Peter--by the time Peter visited on "Brütal," we already had a bunch of art that we then kind of bundled up

80
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,338
and made the factions and stuff like that.

81
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,273
This is, I think, a little earlier in the process.

82
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:20,747
I was hoping to-- I asked Greg to kind of get you guys here as soon as possible to help generate ideas while I'm designing the game,

83
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,316
'cause, um, the game could go so many different areas.

84
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:28,288
And I have this idea about the boy and the girl, but, you know, there's the spaceship, but there could be anything on the spaceship,

85
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:36,296
and there's this pastoral world, but it could be any level of-- it could have anything in it right now, and I think a lot of these, I think coming up

86
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:40,233
with just visual ideas for cool places to go are just as valid a place to start as anything.

87
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:48,875
Petty: This one is, we're at such an early state on, uh, Reds, that, um, you know, Tim-- Tim's only really identified

88
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,144
a few very specific things for us.

89
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:55,181
Schafer: Right now, the green cards are characters-- these are the characters so far--

90
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,584
and the yellow cards are just story points.

91
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:03,523
Um, I'm gonna be adding locations here and, um, puzzles in different colors.

92
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,525
I mean, I told them a lot about what we have.

93
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:12,299
That's really as far as the game has gone because, um, I've been doing a lot of business stuff, which is annoying.

94
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:16,336
Yeah, so I'm way behind on the design and the puzzles, but we did hire a business guy.

95
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:17,737
Rice: So that's good.

96
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,606
Schafer: Which means I won't have to work on Hausen anymore.

97
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:24,344
But luckily, we just hired a business guy to come in and take care of that stuff.

98
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:29,683
Trying to get Brad's new project signed, and, uh, there were a lot of meetings at E3 and stuff.

99
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:35,789
Um, you know, there's a few more details that only make sense to me, but, uh, um,

100
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:41,094
I mostly gave those guys the heads up about where-- where everything is right now, yeah.

101
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:45,031
Uh, it's a story about a boy and a girl, and they both have two different parallel stories going on,

102
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,434
and the player can jump back and forth between them.

103
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:54,007
And the girl is, um, a young girl who's been chosen for this big honor that she finds out is actually being sacrificed

104
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,476
to a horrible monster in order to save her town.

105
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:02,282
And her story is about choosing to break out of that arrangement and endanger her town

106
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,051
and hopefully fight the monster and save her town.

107
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:12,292
And then the boy is a, um-- has grown up alone on a spaceship, a giant, kind of organic spaceship

108
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:17,597
that takes care of his every needs and creates entertainment for him and takes care of his food and his health and everything,

109
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,733
but he's all by himself out in space.

110
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:24,804
And it's about him actually finding out, um, how to take control of that ship

111
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:30,577
and get access to new secret areas and find out that he has the ability to actually, uh,

112
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:33,545
have a higher purpose than just hanging out in this ship being entertained,

113
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:37,583
but he can actually go on rescue missions and save helpless creatures around the galaxy.

114
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:44,056
Chan: Like all the other adventure games, I think he had more landmarks already established.

115
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,092
More tent poles, right?

116
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:52,198
And, um, and then my job was to connect between them.

117
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:58,371
And this time around, yeah, there's less tent poles, and so it's our job to go in and try to figure out

118
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,673
what the other places are right now.

119
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:08,481
Basically, all we're doing is giving him enough of inspiration for him to run with it.

120
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:15,288
Once he sees an image and his imagination starts, you know, uh, walking around in our drawings,

121
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,358
he can then start to expand on that.

122
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,760
That's how it always works with Tim.

123
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,466
Petty: On a creative direction standpoint, you know, Tim--I think Tim fishes a lot, you know?

124
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:32,372
And, um, he kind of gets these elements and then he makes unusual but cohesive connections

125
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,007
between those elements, you know?

126
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,509
And I think that this will help that process for him.

127
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:41,815
Other people maybe have-- have in mind a very specific mythology, and I think Tim's different in different games.

128
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:47,187
Like, I think "Brütal Legend," you know, he had a very, like, "It's a roadie in this heavy metal fantasy world,

129
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:51,191
and it's based on the look of album covers," and Frazetta--some of the very early stuff.

130
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:57,297
A little more--a little more specific than some of this, but I think in the end, he just takes different ways to get there

131
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:01,434
depending on what he feels the game needs or what the theme of the game is really about.

132
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:07,040
Schafer: But, um, it's still in the phase where just, like, everything is like, "Yes, and that could be cool and this could be cool

133
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,143
and this could be cool," and just like, coming up with tons of art.

134
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:14,614
That's my goal. All right?

135
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:21,054
Petty: There's these big gaps in the first two acts past the intro, and that's where I think we can help Tim the most.

136
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:32,298
[Music] Schafer: It is--I'm joking, but it is like a dream team.

137
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,368
I mean, these are the best artists I know, and they're all here together.

138
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:49,716
[Music] Cambell: Man, these are a little dry, dude.

139
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,620
Chan: Who makes this? Petty: Copic.

140
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,590
These are Japanese markers and they're the best, because first, they got a square shape so they don't roll on your table.

141
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:02,362
Right, and they got nice-- nice medium-sized tip, a very nice chisel tip.

142
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:07,667
And they--and they really can lay it down, so all you do to refill it is you just pull this sucker off like that.

143
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,570
And you can buy just tip replacements, too.

144
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,473
-Yeah. -Oh yeah.

145
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:17,076
It's like, uh, I met some-- I met Chris.

146
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:20,246
Cambell: Like a steak--it's like a meat-- it's like a bacon steak root.

147
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,348
-Very nice. -One down.

148
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,517
Bagel: Yam. -Who else?

149
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,852
Chan: So she starts exploring.

150
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:30,657
When she reaches, like, pathways which are made of twigs, all right?

151
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,625
Schafer: Mm-hm. Chan: So there are some paths.

152
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:37,430
Once she's on it, she won't sink anymore, so that--that automatically guides her through.

153
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,199
Schafer: Textural. Chan: Now--awesome.

154
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:43,803
Petty: When he wasn't looking, or when they needed to operate the ship, they started to like fold back, and they have all these like,

155
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:47,774
um, like A.M. clock radio innards, and the arms come out and they start doing stuff

156
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,076
and he turns around and they're like back as a little bunny.

157
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:56,215
Cambell: So, like, these people would be cruisin' around on like combs and brushes, dude, and they'd be combing the land like farming.

158
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,652
So it'd be like farming style, but they'd be farming the trees and shit.

159
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,020
Schafer: Are they pulling out lice to eat or anything?

160
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,555
Cambell: No, it'd just be really pretty.

161
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:08,428
That's the thing, they can be farming, harvesting all the bugs and shit, and then they could put it in their little harvester,

162
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:13,466
but also making really cool shapes from the stuff that they create like that, you know what I mean?

163
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,836
Chan: So, that's what we've got.

164
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:24,177
Bagel: Yeah, I think we're getting closer to-- I think we're just trying to figure out like a language because-- since these things are gonna be 2D painting,

165
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:28,281
I think we really just have to figure out the language of both worlds.

166
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,450
And I think we're like getting...

167
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,721
I think all these drawings, once we put them all up tomorrow and see what Tim says,

168
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:39,425
it'll even be just that next level of direction, you know?

169
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,128
Cambell: But he just gets worried when you throw away your drawings.

170
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:48,267
I don't know if you saw that today, but we had some--some run-ins with some of the artists throwing away their work

171
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,470
'cause they don't think it's good enough.

172
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,606
Schafer: Don't let me bother you, I'm just looking at what you're drawing.

173
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,874
Those are pretty.

174
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:58,244
Where'd that squid go? Bagel: Squid?

175
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,445
Petty: You were painting a squid earlier.

176
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,780
Bagel: Oh yeah, I threw it out, I threw it away.

177
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,181
Schafer: You threw it out? Petty: Oh!

178
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,383
Schafer: You son of a-- Petty: We all liked it.

179
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,584
Cambell: Why'd you throw that away, dude?

180
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,152
Bagel: Son of a monkey. Which one?

181
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,322
Petty: Get a whole sheet. Schafer: Oh my God, and you tore it in half?

182
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,491
Bagel: I can make another one.

183
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,759
Bagel: We'll make another one.

184
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,027
Cambell: Dude, that whole fuckin' page.

185
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,295
Bagel: You guys liked it?

186
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,196
Schafer: Yeah, we paid for that, we paid for that.

187
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,399
You pretty much just stole from the backers by tearing that up.

188
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,101
Bagel: Yeah. Cambell: Why'd you rip that up?

189
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,836
-You crazy, man? Bagel: I know.

190
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,805
Cambell: That was the best shit, man.

191
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:30,009
Bagel: Now, uh-- I didn't think it was that great.

192
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:34,480
Yeah, he picked it out of the trash, my drawing.

193
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,150
And then he told me to do it over again.

194
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,484
Cambell: He'll probably Frankenstein that one and that'll be the...

195
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,154
Bagel: Oh, speak of the devil. Cambell: ...the biggest idea.

196
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,658
Schafer: You guys talking about something?

197
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,193
That's cool.

198
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,462
Weird porcupine guys.

199
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,464
Bagel: It's like moving, uh, on land. Schafer: That's awesome.

200
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:55,768
Chan: I have a lot of faith in Tim, and all we have to do is plant a few seeds

201
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,137
and he'll start running with it, right?

202
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,772
Cambell: Yeah, planting seeds.

203
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,675
Yeah, you don't know what seeds will turn into rad stuff, man.

204
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:24,664
[Music] Cambell: So it's just a list of possible room ideas and experiences, you know?

205
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,200
Just kind of--like, some of them are just words.

206
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,103
They may make us think about some interesting things, you know?

207
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,405
Like wild jungle. It's fun for people.

208
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:39,078
A sunny beach, candy room, garden zone for, like, the tender side of boys.

209
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,817
[Laughing] Maybe those seeds will grow into amazing things

210
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,554
and then we'll realize that those amazing things are actually terrible.

211
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,458
So we'll just cover them up with a sheet and then move on to the next thing.

212
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,293
Who knows?

213
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:58,598
You know, fireball, soccer, playin' with fireballs are really fun, probably, for boys.

214
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:02,735
Laser zone--anything can be made into lasers, so you can eat sandwiches of lasers,

215
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,272
you could just shoot 'em, ride 'em, dodge 'em. You know.

216
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,142
I'll just do drawings and try to get people pumped.

217
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,444
It's my--That'll be my role.

218
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:16,282
So this is like, just, could be waterfalls and different things of goop, and it could be falling down,

219
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,884
or this could be barf, you know?

220
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:23,256
And it could be like animal, or, you know, creatures made of barf kind of unhappy or happy, you know?

221
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,224
Like, and they can be barfing new creatures.

222
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:28,194
It could just be barf zone, you know what I mean?

223
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:31,030
Schafer: Was there a period in your life where you had a barf thing?

224
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,465
Cambell: People love barf, dude.

225
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,567
Schafer: Oh, no, they don't.

226
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,703
Cambell: At this point, everything is disposable and stuff, so.

227
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:43,876
That's the thing about creative processes, like, you wanna go down every road fully

228
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,511
to realize that road is wrong.

229
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:50,750
You can't just go down a little bit and be, "Ooh, uh..." You gotta really test that water fully

230
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,618
before you can realize that's a terrible road.

231
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,421
And then you go down the next road.

232
00:15:55,421 --> 00:16:01,394
Rice: This is a list of locations from our backers on the forums.

233
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:06,032
Petty: You know, some of the stuff, we're just incorporating backer-- uh, backer ideas, which was cool.

234
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:09,335
You know, but they don't really know anything about the story, which is kind of cool at this phase, right,

235
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:13,339
that they don't really have to, that maybe some of those things will wind up working in ways.

236
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,374
Rice: I went through the first ten pages so far.

237
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,676
Schafer: Oh my God, how many pages are there?

238
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,878
Rice: I know, there's 38 or something like that.

239
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,346
Um, we're still in girl world.

240
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,014
Sand castle world?

241
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,115
That's a new one. Bagel: Sand castles.

242
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,617
Rice: Sand castle world.

243
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,118
Boy world.

244
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:29,388
A haunted lighthouse on the moon.

245
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,090
Schafer: What? Bagel: I didn't see that moon comin'.

246
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:37,530
Rice: Um, this dude says, "Inside of a computer." This dude says, "An entire city made of blanket forts."

247
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,832
That was something. Cambell: Yeah.

248
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:44,070
Rice: MS-DOS world, where everything's made from words.

249
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,172
Schafer: That's a text adventure, that's called a text adventure.

250
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:52,645
Rice: "It is a place where you play connect-the-dots to build the location." Cambell: Fuckin' creative people, dude.

251
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,180
Rice: Yeah. Cambell: It's okay if we use that shit?

252
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,581
I mean, dude, we're gonna get...

253
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,517
Schafer: Yeah. Cambell: ...sued.

254
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,320
Seriously, man, fuck, like, I'm so excited to see these lists.

255
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,991
I feel like--I feel like it's cheating, kind of.

256
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:07,792
Bagel: It's like, uh, they're stoked.

257
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:11,162
Like, if somebody gets their idea made, like, that'd be awesome.

258
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:20,238
Cambell: And there's all these sequels based on that one idea that someone said, then they're gonna start being like, "Hm, maybe I should have held onto that idea."

259
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,407
Schafer: The hair trees, wanna mention that.

260
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:27,346
I love all these guys and that whole story, like, whatever-- I don't even know what it is yet, but like,

261
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,250
the idea of going into this, like, grass-covered thing that comes to life.

262
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,621
And this behavior is really cool, it's just like, there's something lazy about it that I like.

263
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,623
Cambell: We've just been trying to get as much stuff as we can.

264
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:41,594
All right, with the big--I just think it's a round hunchback of forest right here.

265
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:44,230
Schafer: It's kind of like those, uh, you know, those places in New Mexico or...

266
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:50,436
Cambell: We're not getting too into the mechanics of how the ship creates things or how the monster land looks or how the city looks,

267
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:55,841
but just kind of overall things that might spark stuff for him right now.

268
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,843
So we'll just do more of that tomorrow.

269
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:29,141
[Music] Chan: I just, uh, did a lot of drawing on my own,

270
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,010
you know, self-taught.

271
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:37,016
I would draw--when I was little, I would draw on paper, and then, if I didn't like something,

272
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,185
I would crumple it up and throw it away.

273
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:48,461
And I remember my father said to me, um, "Now, if you-- if you just slide your drawings into the garbage can,

274
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:54,467
and without crumpling it-- without crumpling it up, you would fit more drawings in the, um, garbage bin,"

275
00:18:54,467 --> 00:19:03,075
not knowing that he was going through it later, um, and pulling out the ones he liked, because, um, after he passed away,

276
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:09,548
I found a folder that was labeled, uh, "Peter," and I found my old Star Wars drawings.

277
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:18,157
Uh, if he didn't do that, I wouldn't have any drawings, because I don't-- I don't really keep my--my stuff around.

278
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:35,274
[Music] As you can see, uh, I tucked in the woods here,

279
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:40,880
and this is where I get my inspiration, is, uh, nature.

280
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:50,656
Um, so, as you know, uh, you're on San Juan Island, and, uh, this is my little studio away from my home,

281
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:55,995
and this is where I create, uh, drawings for games and films.

282
00:19:55,995 --> 00:20:02,702
I'm, uh, in here eight hours a day, and what's nice is on a beautiful day like today,

283
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:07,440
I--I, uh, I like to draw outside when I can.

284
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,611
When I'm having a creative block, that's the time to go out, you know, go on walks and hikes,

285
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:16,415
and that's important to be creative, too.

286
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:20,886
I need to create that space to think.

287
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,855
I love it, can't go back.

288
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:34,366
This fits and feels really, really good for my creative self and for my emotional self and everything else.

289
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,801
It's really good.

290
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:42,408
"Grim" actually was my last adventure game, and it was the-- and it was done here on the island.

291
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:47,279
It was my first job away from Lucas.

292
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:55,287
This was my goin' away present, uh, from Lucas, as you can see.

293
00:20:55,287 --> 00:21:00,659
Never forget where you started, where you come from, and that's something really important to me.

294
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:05,264
'Cause that's why, um, I have, like, some Star Wars stuff in here.

295
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:10,136
It's important that I have a few of those things around because that's what inspired me.

296
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:11,670
That's what got me started.

297
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:17,877
That's why this piece here, by Ralph McQuarrie, is so important to me,

298
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:24,750
'Cause he's the man that, um, inspired me to do what I'm doing now.

299
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:30,122
When I was ten, I didn't know that there was such thing as, a, you know, concept designer,

300
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:35,461
someone that actually designs something for you to live in for those couple hours,

301
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:40,332
if it was a movie, or--or now, hours playing video games.

302
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:45,037
I mean, it's a--an opportunity to escape and live in that world.

303
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,139
This is where I draw, mostly.

304
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:53,212
I do everything standing up, and I still draw on paper, as you can see.

305
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:58,284
Down here is, uh, all the bad ideas right here.

306
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:01,020
See, these are the workups.

307
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:10,196
From this came this one, where it's-- as you can see, is a total mess, and, uh, I try to come up with, uh, some funny ideas,

308
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:13,432
and then from there, becomes this one up here.

309
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:20,773
And then eventually, I use all those drawings, um, to start my fire in the morning.

310
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,212
It's a good lesson on letting go.

311
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:38,490
[Music] I'm gonna show you guys something.

312
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:49,235
These are my family photo albums of when Tim and Pete Tscale came to visit,

313
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:58,110
and, uh, used to do work jams on the island with me at the, uh, farmhouse.

314
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:04,416
That's, uh, me in my upstairs loft studio out of-- in the farmhouse.

315
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:11,257
And those are all the storyboards for "Grim Fandango." And here's me drawing.

316
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:18,330
I don't remember, but Tim swears that I was drawing so fast I was shooting the little ball tips out.

317
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:22,134
Is he gonna kill me? I gotta show you this.

318
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:26,038
I'm not gonna show you the second one, 'cause I know he'll kill me for sure,

319
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:30,542
but I'm gonna give you this one because he looks so good in it.

320
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,412
Tim chopping wood.

321
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,183
And I'm not gonna show you the second one.

322
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:42,988
That's a before, and then this one's after.

323
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:50,729
"Grim" is my favorite, um, adventure game that I've ever worked on.

324
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:55,267
But who knows, this could be the next favorite game.

325
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:59,838
When I start a project, I start collecting my books.

326
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:05,544
It's important to go and do your research, do it the old-fashioned way first.

327
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:14,186
And I learn more by going to the library and reading up on it instead of just looking for a pretty picture off the internet.

328
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:20,059
And so for us to create our own village, I think it's important that we, um,

329
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:26,165
try to find that happy balance between what we're familiar with as fairytale--

330
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:30,502
the signature shape is, like, mushrooms, for, like, Alice in Wonderland--

331
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:35,074
and you balance it with something foreign, something that we're not familiar with.

332
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:40,813
In Japanese architecture, you can kind of see there's mushrooms in it without even thinking about it.

333
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:47,586
There are these great mushroom shapes that are happening, and so I thought I'd mix that up with,

334
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:55,294
um, Scandinavian, like country homes, and that brings in some of the really cute stuff

335
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:58,464
that's happening, see, with the thatched roofing.

336
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:04,002
Here you can kind of see that my wood-burning stove that I put in the background here

337
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:08,741
looks like one of these lanterns.

338
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:12,144
It has, like, the mushroom top.

339
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:21,820
And so, I'm just figuring that out right now, and then eventually have to pitch this to, um, Tim and Lee,

340
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,658
and hopefully sell them the ideas that I have.

341
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:31,063
Um, yeah, I can't wait.

342
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:38,137
And then what's nice, though, is that I'm able to shut that door at the end of the day and walk across the lawn and go home,

343
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:45,611
and I leave, uh, this game in the studio and it doesn't follow me-- follow me home,

344
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:51,316
because my life at home is important.

345
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:57,156
And, uh, and actually, you know, we should get out of here and spend some time outside.

346
00:25:57,156 --> 00:26:00,492
That's where some of the better ideas come from.

347
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:31,657
[Music] Cambell: My name's Scott Campbell and I live here in New York City.

348
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:34,593
We are in my apartment, which also is my studio.

349
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:42,868
I'm an illustrator and I've worked at Double Fine, uh-- I think I was employee number six in 2001,

350
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:47,206
and I was art director on "Psychonauts" and "Brütal Legend."

351
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:50,442
Production designer for "Brütal Legend," my official title.

352
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:56,315
When I was working at the studio, like, I liked to go into his office and just kind of show him,

353
00:26:56,315 --> 00:27:01,620
like, uh, the paintings and drawings and stuff, and I would be able to gauge from his--

354
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,388
his reaction whether or not it was good.

355
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,858
That's what I miss living here in New York.

356
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:12,197
One thing I know that Tim likes, though-- he likes drawings when they're in cool poses.

357
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:15,767
Even if the designs aren't very good, he just likes poses.

358
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:21,273
So if there's a dude that I really like the design of, I'll put him in the coolest pose and hope that he digs it.

359
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:26,245
It was one of my favorite poses is putting his-- putting your feet up on something.

360
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:30,082
Always sell Tim on this pose.

361
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:34,019
I haven't talked to Tim since the very beginning, so I don't know how it's evolved, you know?

362
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:38,190
Just when Tim first pitched the game to Bagel and I, he came here to New York.

363
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:43,195
We had some, uh, some sangria and some tacos and we talked about it and he gave us the pitch.

364
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:48,267
And so after that, you know, Bagel--Bagel and I just kind of started just gathering our friends

365
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:53,172
and just trying out drawing the main two characters and some basic environment ideas.

366
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:57,276
Pre-production is like when you get started and you start dream-- dream the dreams, you know?

367
00:27:57,276 --> 00:28:01,046
It can be anything you want and stuff, and you're just kind of gathering inspiration.

368
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:06,718
Gathering reference is like-- it's like my favorite part, so I'm constantly taking stuff from the internet,

369
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,554
like gathering images and stuff.

370
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:13,825
It's just like if ever I hit-- if ever I see something cool, I'll just kind of take it and put it in a folder for later.

371
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:18,697
Just like kind of the effects or the colors, I don't know what it would inspire, but it just makes me feel pretty good.

372
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,166
I just think that's an odd scene.

373
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:25,270
This is a nice soft picture of a lady that makes me feel pretty good.

374
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,039
I don't know what these are gonna inspire at all, you guys.

375
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,476
I--I do all the drawings like kind of this just on pieces of paper like this.

376
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:37,015
I just draw on Xerox paper and stuff, and I, like, I just scan 'em in and kind of make 'em

377
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,384
look better later, pretty much, so.

378
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:44,122
It's easy for me to kind of like chill out in the morning in a café and do drawings like that,

379
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:49,461
and then kind of like worry about, you know, just so I could kind of-- any way that I kind of relax

380
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:55,133
and kind of loosen up and stuff like that, and I find that if I'm not near a computer, I'm most relaxed.

381
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,235
This is my little drawing zone.

382
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:02,441
See, I print out a lot of my-- a lot of my reference and kind of mood boards.

383
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:05,644
So I have this up and I'm constantly kind of changing it out.

384
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:09,147
You know, update it, and with new things, make me feel different ways, so.

385
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,782
So here are some paintings.

386
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:17,322
So I painted these girls from-- these are from the game, and so I just print out-- print them out,

387
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:23,195
and then just kind of trace 'em onto the paper, and then start--start water coloring like that.

388
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,663
This could be the girl, you guys.

389
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:28,433
This could be the-- this could be the--the drawing.

390
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,236
So let's see what happens together, shall we?

391
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,138
I'm gonna give her this little dress here.

392
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,374
I'm not exactly sure what that's made of.

393
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:38,343
Noodle arms. Well, it doesn't really look like noodle arms.

394
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,178
Okay, there she is.

395
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,314
That's one version.

396
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:45,284
Maybe she has a little buddy, her magical buddy.

397
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,219
We'll see. There you go.

398
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,087
This is, uh, concept art.

399
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:54,059
That's--that's how it works.

400
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,528
That's how magic works.

401
00:29:56,528 --> 00:30:02,134
Oh, here's a painting that Bagel did of Obama a long time ago.

402
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,669
Bagel and I are really tight bros.

403
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:08,607
I moved here, um, about four years ago, and he moved here like a month after.

404
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:14,212
He stayed with our other friend, and then he would just work out of my house 'cause we were still workin' for Double Fine out of my house.

405
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:17,449
And then he just was always over here, so he just found a place over here.

406
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,017
Yeah, he's super close.

407
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,453
I mean, we can just walk there right now even.

408
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:24,322
[Offscreen] Okay, and then we cut to us over there.

409
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,524
Okay, cool.

410
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,798
Cambell: That's his window up there.

411
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:35,100
Bagel!

412
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,237
Hey, bro. Bagel: Hey, buddy!

413
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,373
It's a little tight, sorry, guys.

414
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:45,077
I was gonna try to clean all this stuff up, but I didn't.

415
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:46,344
Cambell: That's okay, man.

416
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:52,784
Bagel: This is my bedroom here and my studio where I paint and where I sleep.

417
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,487
There's my bed, there's my bathroom.

418
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,255
It's pretty amazing.

419
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,057
Um, it's clean.

420
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,827
And this is my kitchen.

421
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:05,230
This is my view, the projects.

422
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,367
And this is like this butcher paper that I had that I imagined I was gonna, like, draw all over,

423
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,269
but that's about as far as I've gotten.

424
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:14,606
But if I ever want to draw on the wall, I could do it.

425
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,509
Painting, I do it--I usually just stick a canvas on the wall.

426
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:22,314
You could see, like, all these paint marks like underneath that map.

427
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:25,984
I just like tack up a canvas on the wall and start paintin' on it, usually.

428
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,652
Yeah, no easel.

429
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:33,225
So I'm just in the sketching phase kind of now, and I do that all right here on the computer.

430
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,994
I have, like, one show a year that's kind of like my sketch.

431
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:39,397
I just work--do work stuff and then have, like, a solo show.

432
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:44,603
That's the--how it's been goin' the last, like, three years, so I just have like one big show to worry about a year.

433
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:47,739
Some stuff I had in the show last year.

434
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:52,077
18 Dads, it's a bunch of dads.

435
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,545
This is just random pieces of paper.

436
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:56,448
This is like how I organize myself, I guess.

437
00:31:56,448 --> 00:32:02,187
These are just studies, like color studies, like N.C. Wyeth and, uh, that's the illustrator that I like.

438
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:03,655
Just weird doodles.

439
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:08,293
First kind of color sketch of that thing, yeah.

440
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:11,263
Tim hadn't even really talked about the idea that he had yet.

441
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:15,767
I would just kind of throw things at him every week, and sometimes he would say that he liked little things

442
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,371
or he would just grab onto something and then I would take it, or, you know,

443
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:22,441
just kind of push things or try other things out.

444
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:28,046
And so, um, I worked out this kind of story about this weird lumberjack and a bear.

445
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:35,120
Like he washes up on this mysterious island, and it's like a magical island in some huge lake

446
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,555
in the Pacific Northwest.

447
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:39,825
This is kind of where the prototype started.

448
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:44,429
Yeah, I had an idea that this, like, caveman got unfrozen with this dinosaur and they ended up, like,

449
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,498
in the--what was it, like, Virginia?

450
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,333
The mountains of Virginia and stuff?

451
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:56,007
And it--it was gonna be all like, uh, bluegrass soundtrack, fish-out-of-water style, and then they would, like,

452
00:32:56,007 --> 00:33:00,479
all play music together or something, but I don't think that's gonna happen.

453
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:04,115
This is where that lumberjack dude is right now.

454
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:09,254
He's gonna be a puppet, so we're, like, separating all of his limbs.

455
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:10,722
I gotta cut him all up.

456
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:18,430
You know, break him up into kind of joints, but really simple puppet-style, so, you know, at the knees, at the elbows, and puppetize him

457
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,632
for Ray to start animating this week.

458
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:24,769
You know, in between these rotating poses, he can, you know, supposedly make him look

459
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,671
like he's going back and forth.

460
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:33,645
So I gotta like paint what's gonna be behind the arms, but he's gonna move it around, so you gotta see what's behind here.

461
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:39,217
Uh, this game is gonna be so totally different and new, so who knows, you know?

462
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:43,788
It's gonna be exciting when we start getting into like, uh, the real deal.

463
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,324
I'm lookin' forward to that, it's gonna be awesome.

464
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,093
Schafer: I've always loved Bagel's paintings.

465
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:55,133
He's, um, when he does his fine art shows and galleries, he does these crazy works that are somewhat surreal,

466
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:59,771
you know, playing with scale and playing with a mix of cartoony and, like, realism.

467
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:04,709
He can do realistic stuff really well, mixes it with cartoony stuff and otherworldly type landscapes,

468
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:10,447
and I think--I wanna do a whole game that'll look like those landscapes and with those strange characters.

469
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:12,149
Bagel: Check it out.

470
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,286
Franzke: It takes a while to actually be responsive, for some reason.

471
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,121
Bagel: No way!

472
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,290
Man, that looks so cool on the iPad.

473
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,456
Rice: Isn't that awesome?

474
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:21,225
Schafer: Did you see that?

475
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,194
Bagel: Is it like a touch and then he walks toward your finger?

476
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,462
Rice: Just touch down.

477
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,464
You have to be in the foreground.

478
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,766
Schafer: We can't go in the back with all the layers yet?

479
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,701
Oliver: Not right now, not this version.

480
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:31,303
Rice: But you can walk around.

481
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,637
Bagel: It's insane.

482
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:38,176
Schafer: It makes me so happy 'cause it's on an iPad and it looks pretty.

483
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:41,780
In the end, all the art will go through Nathan, as he paints the final stuff.

484
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:45,283
So it's all gonna look like his style, so it'll all be unified.

485
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:50,188
You're just gonna see his take on the other artists' ideas and drawings.

486
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:54,491
This'll be more than any game we've done before, like, uh, in the end, you know,

487
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:57,027
a game where Bagel really gets to shine.

488
00:34:57,027 --> 00:35:00,365
Bagel: Yeah, I mean, I guess, I mean, and theoretically, he should be darker, like, you know?

489
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:02,200
I think he's too light right now.

490
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,304
Like, he should blend--the colors, I think, should blend more with the environment.

491
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:09,641
But, um, that's--that-- it's just not in yet.

492
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,343
It's, uh...

493
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:16,681
Lee's gonna do some effects and aftereffects, I think, that lights the character's texture,

494
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,317
so he would be a lot more blue and dark in this one.

495
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,054
Nice.

496
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,192
Killer.

497
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:31,329
I feel pretty awesome about it, I think.

498
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,098
I feel great about everything.

499
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:38,036
Uh, yeah, I think--it's--I'm, like, interested to see how it's gonna go, you know?

500
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:41,373
Like I hope those guys don't hate my paintings of their paintings.

501
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:45,610
You know, it's awesome 'cause they're just gonna be in a sweet painting world.

502
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:52,317
Like, that's-- that gets me pumped that people are gonna be able to, like, explore my paintings, you know?

503
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,689
Rice: That's hilarious.

504
00:35:57,689 --> 00:36:02,394
Bagel: That's amazing, though, dude. Rice: Oh, man, that's super good.

505
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:08,466
Crook: So I'm actually scaling the arms a little bit so that it feels like they go-- Yeah, they get a little bit of perspective.

506
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:09,801
And the feet. Rice: Yeah.

507
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:13,104
Bagel: That totally, uh, that totally works.

508
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:18,143
Petty: It's weird, it's a hybrid process 'cause it's like you're doing a 2D painting, but then we do have to get it on a 3D geometry,

509
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:22,747
so it has some of the cleanup work as if it were a real 3D-- like a full 3D model.

510
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:29,821
Bagel: It depends on how complicated we're gonna get with all the parallaxing and, you know, I have never had to worry about memory issues

511
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:38,463
in painting and restrictions, you know, technical restrictions or anything like that, so, yeah,

512
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:42,667
I mean, it's really, like, gonna be a crazy learning process at the same time, you know?

513
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:52,310
Yeah, putting it all together and makin' it into a working, functional, moving world is, like, I haven't really done that before, so this is a whole--a whole new world.

514
00:36:52,310 --> 00:37:00,151
If I were to say, like, "Ah, here's this-- here's, like, him the most lit he's gonna be." Uh, you know, "Here's him dark as he's gonna be,"

515
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:03,354
and then, like, you're--okay-- Petty: But I think it solves a different problem, right?

516
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:07,792
We're talking about-- like, I think the general color gradients, I think, look good.

517
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,994
I think the rim lighting is a different thing.

518
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:14,999
That's not about lighting as much as it is, like, when there's an intense light source around.

519
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,570
It's about just putting a little bit on there to, like, tie him into the scene.

520
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,740
I think, I mean, you read the comments at the forum, and like everyone found it very appealing.

521
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,409
It really helped the tie-in. Bagel: Yeah?

522
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,312
Schafer: Yeah, Bagel is not, um, really, you know, technical.

523
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,013
He likes to paint.

524
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:40,058
He likes to paint on, you know, canvas and paper, and, uh, um, and that's why it's really invaluable to have someone like Lee Petty on the team who can bridge that gap.

525
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:46,498
He's a fine artist himself, he can draw, he can paint, but he also knows how to use, um, incredibly advanced,

526
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:52,137
you know, techniques and 3D rendering, and, you know, just making games that, you know, a lot of programmers, you know,

527
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:56,508
he can match programmers sometimes with the knowledge of, um...

528
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,443
He's got a lot of knowledge. That's what I'm trying to say.

529
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:01,513
So it's great to have someone like Lee around who can bridge that gap.

530
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:05,049
Petty: That's why I was saying earlier, don't paint the character dark because you can never get lighter.

531
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:08,119
We want to generally paint him pretty light like this 'cause then he can get darker.

532
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:14,826
Schafer: If you can span both worlds, it's really essential, 'cause you can work with a great artist, but then if that doesn't really translate into the game,

533
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:18,830
you can be, um, it's just a waste.

534
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:24,636
Chan: Yeah, I'm--I'm curious as much as you are, and I have faith that it'll work.

535
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:33,077
I mean, Tim--see, that's the thing is like, Tim says, "This is what I--I want to showcase Bagel's style."

536
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:36,347
Perfect. I think that's a great idea.

537
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,317
And so I trust him.

538
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,720
If that's what he wants, then-- then there's something there.

539
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,024
Bagel: Ooh!

540
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:47,392
Petty: All right, Ray. Crook: Go back to your jam.

541
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:48,827
Petty: All right. Bagel: Jam out.

542
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,028
Crook: All right, guys.

543
00:38:50,580 --> 00:39:40,011
[Music] Schafer: You know, very early on, I sometimes have

544
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,614
these stress nightmares about the game not existing yet.

545
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:49,420
I used to have these nightmares about levels in "Psychonauts" that didn't exist yet, and like, I was floating in the undesigned world

546
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,855
and couldn't grab onto anything.

547
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:56,227
It's just like, it's the stress of things that you haven't really pulled together yet.

548
00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:00,164
And these are like little life preservers and the-- floating in the ocean, like, you grab onto them like,

549
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:07,105
"Ah, ah, now I can breathe and, like, look around and see what else I can pull together to make a raft out of," you know?

550
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,139
That's a metaphor.

551
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,608
I like how it's like lighthouse with the haunted house on top of it.

552
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:13,645
Petty: Yeah, it's basic-- Chan: I can go home now? Schafer: What?

553
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,146
Petty: Peter Chan. Bagel: Thank you.

554
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,016
Schafer: Peter Chan, yeah, Peter Chan.

555
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,451
Oh, Bagel's posting! Bagel, Bagel.

556
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,487
Chan: Bagel!

557
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:23,621
Bagel: Yeah. Chan: Yeah.

558
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:24,789
Bagel: Jump in there.

559
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,525
Schafer: Bagel.

560
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:30,561
Okay. Bagel: Floating island maybe that-- Schafer: What's on the floating island?

561
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,330
What are all these guys jumping off?

562
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,866
Penguins? Bagel: Maybe they're loomin' outside the bushes.

563
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,135
Cambell: You should scan those in. Schafer: Crazy imagination.

564
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:39,037
Bagel: Yep, crazy imagination.

565
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:42,240
Schafer: Bradbury early folklore-- Mars folklore.

566
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,609
Ooh, I like Mars folklore. Bagel: Mars folklore.

567
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,544
Yeah, okay, bros, I'm out of here.

568
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:47,645
Schafer: Aw!

569
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,148
Cambell: What?

570
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:52,083
Schafer: Aw, why?

571
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,285
Thank you for comin'. Cambell: See you, buddy.

572
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,687
Bagel: All right.

573
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:56,988
Bye, bros.

574
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:59,691
-All right, buddies. [Offscreen] Bye, Bagel!

575
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:02,493
Chan: Well, I came over to say goodbye.

576
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,462
Schafer: Next time, we come up to you.

577
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,165
Chan: Yeah. Schafer: It's gonna be awesome.

578
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:08,766
Oh, Jesus.

579
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,803
Chan: I know.

580
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:23,480
[Laughter] [Music]

581
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:30,021
Schafer: These are just some, uh, see, Scott is doing some crazy people, which I like.

582
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:33,825
And Lee did some crazy monsters, which I love those, too.

583
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,526
This guy's too young, that's wrong.

584
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:36,761
I love that one.

585
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:38,663
Those are freaking me out.

586
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,199
Um, I don't know what that is.

587
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,202
The Jedi robe.

588
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:45,403
I don't know about the Jedi robe.

589
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:46,671
Some monsters.

590
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,339
That is a really scary monster.

591
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:52,777
I think his little--ugh-- little things up front.

592
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:59,550
And Bagel did this one and it's like a mountain that looks like a wig.

593
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,352
It's like wig mountain.

594
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,154
And that's like a ship, I think.

595
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,989
And these are waves floating.

596
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,258
Little mushroom guy, which I love.

597
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,426
I love these paintings.

598
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,361
They're so tiny.

599
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,196
Sacrificial altars.

600
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:17,435
Here's another vision of the girl's village, really happy and cheerful looking, which I like.

601
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:19,203
This is crazy.

602
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:24,575
It's like a, um... I don't know what that is.

603
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,411
God's eye, we just had that idea today.

604
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,279
That one's gonna work, I think.

605
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,549
This is such a great stage in the project 'cause everything's been, like, in my head

606
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:38,356
and the people's heads and in my notebook, and now it's just exploded out on the wall for everyone to see.

607
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:39,757
Everyone.

608
00:42:40,080 --> 00:43:17,580
