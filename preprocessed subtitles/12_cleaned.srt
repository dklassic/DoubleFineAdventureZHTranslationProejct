1
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,992
Brown: Good, a little more slowly.

2
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:26,293
Technician: And, 115.

3
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,731
Kaufman: Not quite.

4
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:35,869
We won't activate the Omicron Inhibitor until we're ready to take the shields down.

5
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,237
Brown: Mm!

6
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,705
Yes.

7
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,240
Sorry.

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,509
I'm steppin' on you, but: Wow. Yum.

9
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,580
Schafer: "Wow. Yum." Brown: Dude, I love when--

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,549
When they get it right, it's like, fuck.

11
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,150
Schafer: I want to eat your voice when you poop it out.

12
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,451
Brown: It's the best.

13
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,253
Just fucking poopin' in my mouth.

14
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,055
I'm saying that just for you.

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:23,417
[Music] McConnel: Um...

16
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:29,589
I just really like to... to be here whenever I can make it up the...hill.

17
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,794
It is a little reminiscent of the field that the girl starts out in, now, isn't it?

18
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:38,765
When I did that theme, um...we hadn't moved yet.

19
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:45,639
Uh, so I sorta had to imagine that field and work to the picture, um...

20
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:49,876
But you know, uh...

21
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,346
The idea of a...

22
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:58,318
of a beautiful field with solitude that you can go to to just get away from everything

23
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:02,556
and with a little village below is-is definitely, uh...

24
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:06,093
you know, definitely resonates.

25
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:12,132
So maybe I...now that we're moving back to the girl's world, maybe it's time for me to take more of these walks.

26
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:48,802
[Music] Schafer: What is happening here?

27
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,337
What has been going on?

28
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:54,107
I've been so isolated writing in here.

29
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,510
What else has been going on?

30
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,580
Every time I play the game, it's got new crazy stuff in it, which looks awesome.

31
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,682
Franzke: So here's the start screen.

32
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:09,589
And if I can basically linear blend into 8-bit mode and come out again and go back.

33
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:13,460
And the game is actually full--fully playable.

34
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,229
Schafer: I don't know. Oliver just snuck that in over the weekend.

35
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,299
He's like, "Hey, hit this-- hit this key." And I was like, "Why?" And I hit it.

36
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,101
It was like, pow, awesome.

37
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,170
Franzke: Um...and there are a bunch of things that are happening.

38
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,340
I mean, obviously it's pixelated, but we're also, like, kind of compressing

39
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,009
the color range as well, like in the old days.

40
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,446
So we're kind of trying to emulate that you only have 256 colors.

41
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:36,149
Like, since the beginning of the project, I was like, well, you know, I really like the old-school games.

42
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,885
I like the pixelated art style that we had back then.

43
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:45,225
Um...and then I was like, well, I wonder if I can just, like, take the image and do some

44
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:50,564
just shader work to it to, like, make it look like, you know, it's a game made in the '90s sometime,

45
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,299
like a little bit 8-bit.

46
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,768
Uh, and it works pretty well, actually.

47
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,374
So far it seems okay, actually.

48
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,176
I thought I would be way more stressed out.

49
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:07,481
So far it's okay, and probably, uh, when you do the-- when you can do the whole cutting thing,

50
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,817
you can cut, like, you know, months in the future; I will be sitting here like, oh my God!

51
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:16,523
Schafer: And the team is bringing up the last parts of "Act 1" to alpha level.

52
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,524
Um, starting work on the pyramid.

53
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:22,229
There's a pyramid in the game that's getting brought to alpha this week,

54
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,231
and it's looking awesome.

55
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:28,301
Well, alpha is just that there's something rough in there representing everything.

56
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:32,305
There's like, mm-- all the assets are, like-- Something's in there taking a place for them.

57
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:36,676
And then--and then you get them all workin' the way you want them to for beta.

58
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:41,148
And then after beta, you're hopefully just fixing bugs.

59
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,516
Way ahead of schedule.

60
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:45,285
Rice: We're--we're good.

61
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,156
We're where I said we should be.

62
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:52,159
Schafer: Well, things move quick once you-- You know, you have certain deadlines.

63
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:57,197
Like, we wanted to get a bunch of, um, voice done so we could get a PAX trailer.

64
00:04:57,197 --> 00:05:01,301
And, um, also 'cause the animators are waiting for the voice to start--

65
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,105
They haven't finished, like, a single scene in the game yet 'cause then you want the final voice in there.

66
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:09,709
So we wanna get that done, and once it starts rolling, it, um, it goes pretty quickly.

67
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:13,346
Crook: You know, when they play, go through the playthroughs and stuff right now, sort of the animation

68
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:16,383
is sort of the least polished, oftentimes.

69
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:20,821
And, um, and so sometimes it's rough, like, to sit through playthroughs, you know,

70
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:25,592
and-and know that the quality is not there yet just 'cause you haven't gotten to that phase.

71
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,527
Schafer: Greg came in; he has a question for us.

72
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,129
Brown: Greg! Rice: Hi.

73
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,497
Brown: How are you doing?

74
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,732
Rice: I am doing well, how are you?

75
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,367
Brown: Hey, I'm good.

76
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:40,540
Rice: Sweet. Um, no, I just, uh, I got an email from our new executive assistant

77
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,544
that was trying to set up Tim's flights, so I wanted to see how things were looking

78
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,414
and if she should go ahead and do that.

79
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:56,289
Brown: So if each one of these characters has at least 80 lines to read, then, yes.

80
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,458
Rice: I think we're gonna have enough written.

81
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,595
Schafer: So that's a question for Malena or someone with access to the database.

82
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,763
Rice: We can have Malena run that right now.

83
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,432
Schafer: Okay. Today we're gonna start.

84
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,800
Please welcome Malena.

85
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,501
Malena Annable.

86
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,170
Annable: I'm so happy to be here with you guys.

87
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:15,308
Schafer: Here in person. She's come through the magic of the screen to our world.

88
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:19,779
Just like the monsters in "Pacific Rim." She is a producer,

89
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:24,584
and she specializes in localization and things involving the dialogue database.

90
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:28,154
Um...even though she's up in Portland, she remotely tracks all that stuff

91
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,490
and she does localization for all of our games.

92
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:36,496
And, um, she is the one pushing on me for the writing deadline to get it into Khris' hands, 'cause it kinda goes,

93
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:43,169
she gets the raw writing and puts it in the database, and, um, and gets the script all ready to hand off to Khris.

94
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,008
That's a good question; why is she here?

95
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,809
Maybe she's up to something.

96
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,746
Annable: Yeah, I wanna talk to you about more dialogue things and...

97
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,447
Schafer: I have to write more dialogue? Annable: Yeah, you do.

98
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,182
Schafer: God. Annable: You don't want me to write it.

99
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,884
Schafer: Gotta be done by now. It's gotta be done by now.

100
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:01,254
Annable: So, yeah, so I'm-I'm busy with that all week.

101
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:05,492
I'm happy to see everyone. Schafer: But if I write it this week, it'll screw up the schedule, 'cause...

102
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,028
Okay.

103
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:12,265
Annable: So I want Tim to write in the way that whatever feels most comfortable to him.

104
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,269
And as fast as possible.

105
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:21,474
Dialogue is so important to our games, so making sure that we have, like, a really strong system--

106
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:26,546
I have--there's a dialogue database that Paul Du Bois built and it's amazing.

107
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:31,217
And it's just--for me, it's just management of, like, you know, tens of thousands of files.

108
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:35,021
I mean, "Brütal Legend," there are over 35,000 lines of dialogue,

109
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,223
and I had to manage that across five languages.

110
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:40,727
And...it wasn't that bad.

111
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:48,635
Rice: But, yeah, we could have Malena check out current status of lines per character.

112
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:54,074
And so if that happens, you think, um, like, casting-wise we'll be ready?

113
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:58,044
Brown: Um, I think we will. I think we're, like-- I think by the end of this meeting

114
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:02,716
we will know who we're gonna choose for everything, and then it'll be me calling and checking avails

115
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,417
on them all for next week.

116
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,852
Schafer: And then a lot of our friends are coming back.

117
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,989
Richard Horvitz, the voice of Raz, is gonna be doing some voices.

118
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:13,193
And Jennifer Hale, um, from "Brütal Legend" and "Mass Effect," is gonna be--

119
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:18,565
Yes, Shepard is gonna be doing, uh, I think the Mom computer.

120
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:23,436
Um...and that's all we have to announce right now as far as voice, but that's very exciting stuff.

121
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:28,007
Get that all wrapped up so we'll actually have something that we can put into the game and show at PAX.

122
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,442
This weekend?

123
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,444
This weekend, oh my God, it's coming up so soon.

124
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:36,383
We're flying down to LA to record the voice for the game, at least a third of it.

125
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,585
It's a third of the voice for the game.

126
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:43,256
And we've got some, um, interesting people coming down to do voice.

127
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:47,460
Some old friends, some hopefully new friends.

128
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,997
We'll be locked in a room together, me and Khris Brown, for four days.

129
00:08:50,997 --> 00:09:08,548
[Music] Horvitz: There is no room in the Space Weaver's life for friendship.

130
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:13,820
Brown: Aww... Horvitz: He slides alone, like a shuttle of yarn across the warp of time

131
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,158
on an ever so--shortening-- Schafer: Fucked that up.

132
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,026
How can you fuck that up?

133
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,494
You totally fucked that up.

134
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,695
Horvitz: I love that!

135
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:23,997
That is so fucking good.

136
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,165
All right. Here we go.

137
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,700
Schafer: It's kinda like he's Pee Wee, rebel, loner.

138
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,835
Technician: And, 24.

139
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:32,605
Horvitz: Look, see, see, look at this, look at this island in front right here, see?

140
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,374
And it's just like this hairline's receding.

141
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,442
I can't stand it.

142
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,543
Brown: Really? Schafer: Lice check? Lice check?

143
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,044
Brown: It looks good. Horvitz: No, not...

144
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,646
Brown: Tim, you have lice.

145
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,514
We have never cast a game this quickly.

146
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:45,351
Um, and we have never cast a game with, um, a budget this limited.

147
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:49,089
I mean, it-- with the exception of, you know, with "Day of the Tentacle," you have, like,

148
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,690
1,500 lines, you know what I mean?

149
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,394
But even then, I think, um...

150
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:59,065
I think we probably spent more money on "Day of the Tentacle." That's Tim, who started the company,

151
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,769
and he was one of the chief game designers at LucasArts, working on, like, "Monkey Island"

152
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,372
and kind of this whole, um, set or series of games

153
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,842
that people feel really strongly about.

154
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:12,312
They have a really strong emotional connection to those games, and then we've continued...

155
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,047
I started at LucasArts in 1990.

156
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,548
And there were 60 of us.

157
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,684
Like, LucasArts was 60 people.

158
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,186
I mean, we were a bunch of goofball rejects.

159
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:25,492
It's not--it's not how it is now, where you have guys who go to college

160
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:30,830
and then video games is a place where you can be successful financially.

161
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,098
Do you know what I mean?

162
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,235
We were all kids who were alone...

163
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,670
and computers were...

164
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,472
our friends, you know?

165
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,810
And so then we were in a safe place where we could be together.

166
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,478
So, yeah, we super bonded.

167
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,813
Um, all of us.

168
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,649
I mean, we all still talk to each other and I think we'll talk to each other

169
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,551
for the rest of our lives.

170
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:55,855
Schafer: Yes, we do know each other really well, 'cause she was back at Lucas back in the '90s.

171
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,224
So we've known each other for a long time.

172
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,594
You get into a lot of strange, um...

173
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,129
kinda routines in the studio.

174
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,165
When you--it's like-- for some reason, sitting in the recording studio is grueling.

175
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,602
Like, you're just sitting in this little chair, you're hearing voices, but like after a day of that

176
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,504
you're like, oh my God, I was in this tiny room all day.

177
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,007
Like, I mean, maybe it's like editing for you guys.

178
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,610
But it's like, you're in a tiny room, faced with a big control panel and you're talking

179
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,379
over this inter--I don't know why it's so exhausting.

180
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:25,084
I am so delirious from that 30-hour session that I, uh, I don't even know who I am anymore.

181
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:29,088
Brown: It's almost like it was "Brütal Legend." Schafer: Oh, God.

182
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,423
Thirty hours.

183
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,359
I delegated all the hard sessions of that one.

184
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,794
I only come for the movie stars.

185
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,129
Brown: You're tellin' me, man.

186
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,301
Schafer: I mean, I only come for the stuff.

187
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,602
Brown: You only come for the important stuff.

188
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:46,439
Schafer: I leave the stuff where the script is really idiot-proof.

189
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,707
Do you like that term?

190
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,075
That's like a writing term.

191
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,844
Like, it's director-proof.

192
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,313
Yeah.

193
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:57,016
In screenwriting class they're like, "You gotta really write your script so it's director-proof."

194
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,453
Brown: That's because people were working with directors who aren't me.

195
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,456
Schafer: It's just--it's a...

196
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,426
That's obviously not the way I feel.

197
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,794
Brown: What?

198
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,196
Schafer: That's obviously not the way I feel.

199
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,632
Brown: You just--okay, so I wanna hear Frank's blowjob story.

200
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:14,133
No, your writing is awesome.

201
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,768
It's perfect and fantastic.

202
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,637
Schafer: It doesn't compare to Frank's blowjob story.

203
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:22,575
So in between takes, um... you just start to, um...

204
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,111
for some reason tell extremely dirty jokes.

205
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,046
This is going in a weird direction, obviously.

206
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,149
Brown: Well, the camera's off, right?

207
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,585
Schafer: Nope.

208
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:37,624
It's like, um, going to some weird, uh, foxhole or trench together.

209
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,325
Technician: Hi, Jan. [Offscreen] Hey, how are ya?

210
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,194
Technician: I'm good, how are you? [Offscreen] Good. Good to see you.

211
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,129
Technician: You too. [Offscreen]Check, check, check, check.

212
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,364
Check, check.

213
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,299
Check, check, check, check.

214
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,767
Cash, cash, cash. Mark?

215
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,268
[Technician] Yeah, you're--no, you're good.

216
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,337
No, please no more.

217
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:56,209
Schafer: The boy, Shay, that's the story about a boy who was, um, raised essentially

218
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,646
by a giant spaceship all by himself, and he lives alone on this giant spaceship

219
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,347
and it's very quiet and lonely.

220
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,716
Um, and he's cared for by...

221
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:07,553
uh, there's a mom and a dad that appear on the computer screens and take care of him.

222
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:11,024
And these big, like, knitting arms come down for the mother and that's you, the mom.

223
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:14,427
Hale: Oh... Schafer: And it was great when he was 7, but now he's 14, he's startin' to feel

224
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:17,497
like he's tired of this kid stuff and he wants to do something real with his life

225
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:18,731
and go out on adventures.

226
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,733
And so he meets this shady character...

227
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:25,071
People who do--the professional voice talent people, like Jennifer Hale and Richard Horvitz,

228
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:28,508
who just do this all the time, they walk in the studio, they don't know anything about it, they grab the script

229
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:32,111
and they cold read it, and they nail it after a couple lines like that.

230
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,248
Brown: And they walk in, and it's like, okay, they gotta pull it out.

231
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:39,085
So it's--it is the hardest-- you know, as Jen Hale says, she's like,

232
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:42,655
"It's not just acting, it's acting on steroids." It is the hardest job.

233
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,259
And you can't rely on your facial expressions.

234
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:50,630
And how frantic is she when she's, um, "Shay, where are you going?

235
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,800
It's not safe. Shay!!!" with three exclamation points?

236
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,036
Schafer: Um-- Brown: Is it like yelling, or...?

237
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,671
Hale: On a scale of 1 to 10.

238
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,607
Schafer: Um, she--this is when even more hell has broken loose.

239
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,844
Like, the ship is actually being attacked now, and Shay is running to go fix it.

240
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,312
He's gonna go get his space suit.

241
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,015
And he's running down the hallway, and so you're in one of the orbs

242
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:12,285
and you're doing your normal thing, like, trying to calm him down, but then he's not stopping

243
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,853
and you're like, "Hey, he's not listening to me.

244
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,622
He's not listening to my-- He's not being calmed down by my thing.

245
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:20,259
And then, what's he doing?" Hale: Okay, so 4:48, is it,

246
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,464
"Dear God, he's going to die," or is it, "Hey, listen to me"?

247
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,866
Schafer: No, it's the--it is the first-- the former more.

248
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:31,337
Hale: "Dear God, he's going to die." Schafer: Like he--like's running out into a tornado, kind of like--

249
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,172
Hale: He's running into a tornado, okay.

250
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,308
Shay! There you are.

251
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:38,277
Something's happened to the ship, but don't worry.

252
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:41,114
Your father's gone out to fix it.

253
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,682
Shay, where are you going?

254
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,250
It's not safe!

255
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,585
Shay!!!

256
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,387
Brown: There we go. Schafer: Wow.

257
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,490
Schafer: Nice. Brown: Perfect.

258
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,492
You know, and the actor loved it.

259
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:57,130
I mean, you really want an actor who loves what they do.

260
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:02,635
I don't hire celebrities for a payday.

261
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:07,106
At any other company, at any other studio, people will say, "Oh, let's get so-and-so!

262
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,777
You know, we're X studio, we have X million dollars.

263
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:14,080
Let's just pay them, because it's gonna be rear ends in seats."

264
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,650
And I'm like, why do you want someone who's only here for a payday?

265
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,354
Otherwise, it's a waste. It's a waste of money, it's a waste of the actor's time.

266
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,757
You don't want someone who's just, like, not having fun and not into it.

267
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,094
And that's the thing about Tim's writing and that's the thing about Double Fine,

268
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:35,067
is that it's so incredibly rewarding, the actors, they come in and they do it for essentially what's free.

269
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,070
Hale: All missions are cancelled.

270
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,605
I love you.

271
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:47,747
Brown: Good. Can we get, um, three in a row, um, slow and super sincere?

272
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:50,783
Hale: Uh-huh. Brown: Of "I love you"s?

273
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,819
Schafer: Is that just for personal use?

274
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:57,223
He--this boy is-- now that he's 14, he's startin' to feel like, "I'm sick of these--

275
00:15:57,223 --> 00:16:02,662
I wanna do some actual action and get out there." Kaufman: Yeah. Schafer: And that's when he meets Marek.

276
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:05,865
He's, like, the wolf who comes out of the cracks; he's been watching.

277
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,434
Brown: Do you wanna hear the aud, or are you good?

278
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,136
Kaufman: Uh, yeah, I'll listen to it again.

279
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,105
I-I-I...you mean, my, uh...?

280
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,440
Brown: Your read? Kaufman: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

281
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,677
David Kaufman, Marek.

282
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:21,447
You came because you are done with children's games.

283
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:26,118
My name is Marek, and what I'm about to show you is no game.

284
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,854
Schafer: We were talking about that when we were casting.

285
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:31,824
It was like, well, we have this other guy we know can do it, but I really like this guy's voice, and it's new.

286
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,394
And I usually tend to go for that, like, really unique voice more often,

287
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:39,198
even though it's a risk, because sometimes you bring somebody in 'cause you like the audition

288
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,435
and you don't know anything else about them and it turns out they can't do anything else

289
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,704
except for that exact thing they did in the audition.

290
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,305
Or they can't hit the audition again.

291
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,308
Sometimes we've had people come in and they just can't seem to capture

292
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,677
the magic of the audition again.

293
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,715
And even-- so we'll play it for them, like, "Listen to this audition."

294
00:16:55,715 --> 00:17:00,453
And they'll be like, "Um... I don't wanna do it that way." He's--the way you read that is a nice contrast to the mom,

295
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:05,156
who's--the computer is like this-- the ship's computer is like this really over-mothering mother

296
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:09,194
who's just, you know, everything is sweet and she's being so sweet to the boy all the time,

297
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,330
and then you're just, like, you're not cutting him any slack and you're just like,

298
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,865
"I'm not here to love you, right?

299
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,002
There's war going on." Kaufman: Tell no one.

300
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,704
Do you understand?

301
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,444
No one.

302
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,046
Schafer: Whoa.

303
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,281
Kaufman: No one.

304
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,750
Schafer: I like that; scary.

305
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,752
Kaufman: No one.

306
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,186
Brown: Perfect.

307
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,490
Yeah, having this dude in here has just, like, made the game, like, whoa, fuck.

308
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:43,462
I mean, to see those people come to life, I mean, as you saw with Marek, like, all of a sudden, you know,

309
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,298
it wasn't just these lines on the page.

310
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,732
It was like, holy shit.

311
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,669
Like, yesterday when I was listening to him I was like, oh-kay.

312
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:53,372
This game, uh...um...

313
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,274
It's not just a funny thing anymore.

314
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:59,779
Like, it's not just like, oh, this is really sweet and we have this sweet boy and he's coming of age.

315
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:06,118
But once we had Marek, it's like, that's the linchpin, do you know what I mean, for the boy's story.

316
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:09,789
Like, once we have him, that was crazy, you know?

317
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:14,260
And I--and I went home and I was like, okay, this game has a heart, it lives and it breathes,

318
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,196
because we have that conflict and we have that intrigue.

319
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,232
And that's, I mean, that's so amazing.

320
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:24,203
The game went from being, like, oh my God, it's cute and it has beautiful characters and da-da-da.

321
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,807
But, like, Marek-- And I'm-- seriously, like, I am-- these guys will tell you,

322
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,209
like, one, I'm s-- a total super bitch.

323
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:34,380
Two, like, like, there's--I--like...

324
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,082
There's no reason for me to tell you this.

325
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,717
Like, there's zero, right?

326
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,720
Kaufman: That's awesome. Brown: Yeah. It's fucking awesome.

327
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,022
Schafer: She's even understanding what a bitch she is.

328
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,725
Also that.

329
00:18:45,725 --> 00:19:09,682
[Music] [Mario game sounds]

330
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,851
Schafer: Sorry. I'm getting really into this game now.

331
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,286
Brown: No, it's super cute. I like the little sounds.

332
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:18,457
Schafer: Oh, I walked right down the thing, the thing!

333
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,292
Brown: I really...

334
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:25,297
I'm trying to resist getting...this.

335
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,768
Because I wanna play "Animal Crossing." Schafer: Get "Animal Crossing." It's good for you.

336
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,536
Brown: I--no, I can't.

337
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,238
Schafer: "Animal Crossing" made me a better person.

338
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:35,241
Brown: Really? Schafer: Yeah, 'cause it's all about...

339
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,475
Brown: Making nice things?

340
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,145
Schafer: Just every day-- no, just every day doing a little bit of stuff.

341
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:42,615
Not, like, rushing through things for a goal or anything like that.

342
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:45,751
It's really-- I think it's mentally good for you to play it.

343
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:49,121
Dang it, I really suck at this game.

344
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:53,159
Brown: 'Cause every minute that I'm not either working or...

345
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,260
Schafer: Hello!

346
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:01,400
Hello there. Black: Hi, Tim Schafer.

347
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,538
Schafer: Welcome to the project "Broken Age." Black: Thank you for having me here. Is it well lit enough?

348
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,540
I feel like we're in a dark shadow.

349
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,774
Here we go.

350
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:13,479
Schafer: I feel good about this. Good.

351
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,847
Black: Tell me about the project.

352
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,148
What are we doing today?

353
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,483
Schafer: I'm so glad that you asked.

354
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,018
Black: Is this who I'm gonna be voicing?

355
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,720
Brown: Yes. Schafer: Yeah, Harm'ny.

356
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,721
We're, like--yeah, he's kinda like a guru.

357
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,156
Brown: He's like a cultic personality.

358
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:27,693
Schafer: And a little, like, not shady, but a little bit like, "Heyyy, hey."

359
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,195
'Cause he's a little bit of a fraud.

360
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,329
Black: Okay. I have no idea what's going on.

361
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,699
Schafer: And Harm'ny's main thing, he runs the cloud colony, that's his main thing.

362
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,701
Black: Harm'ny is a cult leader. Schafer: Yeah.

363
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,703
And a little bit of a fraud. Black: And he runs the cloud colony.

364
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:42,007
And is he also like other gurus, where it's also about, like, uh...

365
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:47,246
"Let me give you my seed. It's--believe me, this is--" Brown: See? All the guys wanna touch your vagina.

366
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,248
That's what I said: Does he wanna touch vaginas?

367
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,883
Because all those dudes do!

368
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:54,086
Schafer: We don't really-- Black: Well, all the gurus, it comes down to--yeah.

369
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,623
Brown: For sure! Schafer: We don't really explore that very much in the game, but I don't think it's--

370
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,592
Black: No. And we don't need to.

371
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,494
It's-it's-it's there, though. It's underneath.

372
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,762
Brown: It's implied, it's implied. Schafer: I think people assume.

373
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,500
Seeing Jack again was really fun.

374
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:13,539
Um, I haven't seen him for-- since the end of "Brütal." And so it was fun to see Jack again.

375
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:14,840
He was a good sport.

376
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,144
Black: I feel like I need to research a little while before I start acting.

377
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,079
Schafer: We told you way too much.

378
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,616
Okay, so there's a few lines today and there'll be more in-- we haven't done--

379
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,584
we've only written the first half of the game so far.

380
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:29,789
So when we're at the second half, I hope we can get you to come back again, yeah.

381
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,223
Black: Okay, you ready?

382
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,827
Technician: Cool, I'll give you a take number, then we'll be rolling, and if you need

383
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,495
your headphones adjusted, just let me know.

384
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,630
Black: All right, and...

385
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,098
Technician: It's take 1.

386
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:44,737
Black: Take 1, self "Action." Oh-ho-ho, oh my!

387
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:50,176
A fresh face rises from below.

388
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:52,044
Oh my!

389
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:56,182
A fresh face rises from below.

390
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:57,817
Oh my!

391
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,119
A fresh face rises from below.

392
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,287
Schafer: I like that.

393
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:04,423
Black: Wait, let me be more of a cult guy.

394
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,525
Oh my!

395
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,460
Oh my...

396
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,863
Oh my goodness.

397
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:13,699
A fresh face rises from below.

398
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:14,834
Hello.

399
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,136
Before you ask, let me answer.

400
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:20,272
Yes, you may live here in Meriloft forever.

401
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,674
Brown: That's perfect.

402
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,242
Schafer: I love that gentle version you just did.

403
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:24,510
Brown: Love it. Schafer: That's awesome.

404
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,679
Black: Before you ask, let me answer.

405
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,683
Yes...you may live here in Meriloft forever.

406
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,218
Schafer: Yaaay, I love that one.

407
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:33,819
Black: Oh, now we're gettin' somewheres.

408
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:37,122
Schafer: Yeah, it was really fun to watch Jack come in there and just start with one thing and he does it

409
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:40,392
over and over again and he kinda hones in on the character.

410
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,495
And we're not directing him, but we're directing him by not directing him

411
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:47,399
in that he knows that if we hear something we really, really like, we'll chime in and be like,

412
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:51,537
"That! That's perfect. That's amazing." So if he's not hearing anything, he's just gonna keep working it

413
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:56,008
and working it until, you know, he gets something that he likes and then we'll probably like it, too.

414
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:59,545
Black: What? No! What? No!

415
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,314
Uh...I mean...

416
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,016
Take it away.

417
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:08,487
I need it like I need a-- I need it like a blue jay needs a bowling ball.

418
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:13,726
Schafer: Maybe he--yeah, he really recomposes himself and does--goes back to his total, like, smooth guy voice.

419
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,761
Black: Oh, okay, yeah.

420
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,463
Black: What? No!

421
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:21,300
I'm...uh...I mean...

422
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,302
take it away.

423
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:26,205
I need it like a blue jay needs a bowling ball.

424
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:28,440
Brown: Good. Schafer: That's awesome. Great.

425
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,009
Black: Am I--am I all finito?

426
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,343
Brown: Yeah. Schafer: That's it for now.

427
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,646
Black: That was so easy! Schafer: That's so easy!

428
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,350
Yeah, I do have the little one, and this one.

429
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:43,489
Black: I feel like I should do something dramatic so that-- Schafer: You wanna punch me? Black: Yeah.

430
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:47,793
That'll teach you to not give me a very big part in your game.

431
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,762
Schafer: That felt right. That felt good.

432
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,864
That was dramatic.

433
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,766
Crook: How was recording? Was that good?

434
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,334
Schafer: Oh, yes. This is, like, like, dailies.

435
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,435
Rice: Tell us all about it.

436
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,003
Schafer: Uh, recording was--was awesome.

437
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,674
Yeah, Marek was awesome. He does this kinda creepy thing.

438
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:03,342
Kipnis: Who is he? Rice: Who is he?

439
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:07,546
Schafer: He's...he's someone who does a lot of game-- no, a lot of game work, but, um--

440
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,048
Kipnis: Was it Lee? Schafer: I didn't recognize his name.

441
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,182
It was Lee Petty.

442
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:13,285
No, he did it different than Lee.

443
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,222
Like, Lee was kinda like, "Yeah, you, gah..." That sounds like Lee. Rice: Yeah.

444
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:21,794
Schafer: He was more like, "Come here further--" He was--he did it a little creepier.

445
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:27,800
"While you've been traveling and plating ice cream..." Rice: Oh, that's awesome. Schafer: "...and playing with trains--"

446
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,404
And, uh, Richard Horvitz, who did Raz, did, um, a couple of characters.

447
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:33,706
And he did the Space Weaver.

448
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:37,776
Not as good, of course, as Dave's, but it is Raz.

449
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:44,516
None of the cut scenes have been animated because we just got the professional VO in,

450
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,885
so you'll hear the professional VO, but we haven't animated to it,

451
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:50,022
so it's a lot of, like, animatics, like, sliding around, which I'm sure

452
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,824
you've seen before in games, maybe.

453
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,259
Rice: You gotta wait till you have the voice to animate to it.

454
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:57,196
-Ah, okay, right. Schafer: So some of the-- some of the background art is final

455
00:24:57,196 --> 00:25:02,601
and some of the in-game animation is more final, but, uh, the cut scenes definitely get super janky.

456
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:06,839
Crook: We've got all the pro VO, and so...

457
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:11,610
we just have too much work to do for the animators that we have.

458
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:17,016
I mean, we used to have a much bigger animation team, uh, which was-- it was probably a little more

459
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:21,086
than double, maybe, than what we have right now, when we were on "Brütal Legend."

460
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:28,027
Um, and, you know, people have left and we've just never replaced anybody, so...um...

461
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,729
So, yeah.

462
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:36,402
So, yeah, so we had to hire an outside animation team or a company.

463
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:39,772
Schafer: We have so much animation to do, we have to use outsourcers, which we've never done.

464
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:44,243
I've never done outsourced animation before 'cause we've always tested it and it's always looked terrible.

465
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:50,282
But this group looks good, and the test we did looks good, and so hopefully they'll just do some awesome stuff

466
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:53,585
that'll help us get the game done on time.

467
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,554
Is that it? Rice: Yep, I think so.

468
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:59,124
Schafer: Get it all out. Let's outsource the rest of it and take it-- call it a day.

469
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,526
Petty: Pleasure cruise. Rice: Perfect.

470
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:01,593
Schafer: Woo!

471
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,466
Gardner: Oh, see, he's typing.

472
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:11,036
See, that's someone typing in Portland.

473
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,172
What's gonna happen?

474
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,675
Look! See?

475
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,143
Aww.

476
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:19,545
See?

477
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:22,314
He, like--I think he even is a backer, too.

478
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,483
Yeah, see, he is a backer.

479
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:25,551
Ha!

480
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,052
This is Alex.

481
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:30,289
He's the guy that's supervising all of the stuff over at Super Genius.

482
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:33,492
And they're the people that we're doing the contracting with up in Portland.

483
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:40,098
So you can see in this animation, it's really-- this-this hand gesture

484
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:44,403
of the wolf, the attention that somebody spends, it really feels like there's more

485
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:46,071
than just two drawings there.

486
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:50,142
And it's that sort to attention to detail that we just don't have the time.

487
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:53,812
What we get with Super Genius is that we get to add all that character to the animations

488
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:59,017
and we get to spend all that time saying, "Hey, this'll just be hilarious if we make him, like, you know,

489
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:04,389
skip down the, you know, the hill instead of just copy the walk animation and paste it there."

490
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:09,261
And we get the-- we get to add all that stuff, but instead of right now being like,

491
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,196
"What are we gonna do? We're screwed!

492
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:15,200
Like, there so much work to do!" And then you ship a game and it's like you just look at it and you're like,

493
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,704
wow, we didn't polish that, we didn't polish that, you didn't polish this, you didn't polish that.

494
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:23,242
Like, there's always, like--there's-- you ship a game and there's-- all you see is, as an animator,

495
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:25,077
is the stuff you didn't polish.

496
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,278
And, uh...

497
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,251
You know, with Super Genius, it's like hopefully what we're gonna see is a game where it's like

498
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:36,655
that game where you're al--that I've always wanted to work on, where everything's polished,

499
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,591
where you look at it and you're like, the whole thing is--is all--

500
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,660
is done all the way.

501
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,861
How about this?

502
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,464
Hey, Ray?

503
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,366
Will you--so-- Crook: I'm workin'!

504
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,734
I'm workin'; leave me alone.

505
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:51,436
Gardner: I know, I finally got you workin'.

506
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:55,274
I want you to see this, uh-- Crook: I turned this over to you so I could just work.

507
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,075
I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

508
00:27:57,075 --> 00:28:02,147
Schafer: Oh, yeah. Our expert crack team of judges are the animation department.

509
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:07,319
I mean, the animators, they're the ones who are-- Ray's the lead animator, so he's in charge of making sure

510
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:13,492
that everything animated on the project looks good, including the outsourcing team, so we leave that up to him.

511
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:19,765
Crook: Once we got the--the pro VO, it kinda changed the wolf a lot for me.

512
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:24,436
It's fine. I mean, I don't think Tim has seen this scene, so...

513
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:29,174
I hope he's--he's still okay with-- See, I hope he's still okay with that sort of, like...

514
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,475
Gardner: Oh, this?

515
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,311
Crook: The, like, poppy gestures, you know?

516
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:35,747
Where he, like, comes up and he's like, bum-bum, bump.

517
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,784
I mean, it's-- it's probably okay.

518
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:43,655
-It's probably okay. Roberts: Yeah, it-- Until--until Tim sees it and says--yeah.

519
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:48,226
Gardner: If he was--like, if he just drew back slower-- Crook: Right.

520
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,029
Marek: Affirmative. Crook: "Affirmative." Yeah, I think we should just slow it down.

521
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,999
I think he should be more like, "Affirmative." Gardner: All right, cool. Then I'm gonna give 'em

522
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,267
the note to watch out for that.

523
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,768
Crook: And just--just make it less poppy.

524
00:28:56,768 --> 00:29:01,640
The--but he delivers it pretty quickly, so...

525
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,875
We'd better let Tim choose.

526
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,345
And then-then-then-then Elliott can win.

527
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,081
Roberts: Fuckin' Lee.

528
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,120
Schafer: All right. Rice: Cool.

529
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,556
Schafer: Don't show this stuff. Rice: I won't.

530
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,524
Just, it's pretty. That's all you need to know.

531
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,860
Hamilon: Yeah, that this part of the game is pretty?

532
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:26,465
Um...but yeah, this--I mean...

533
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:29,501
Yeah, this is cool. This game looks good.

534
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,269
I wanna play more.

535
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,405
When you--are you guys gonna have a demo of this game?

536
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:38,777
Greg: Also meeting today about a PAX demo, um, and what the scope of that will look like.

537
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,414
Start figuring out a plan for that.

538
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:43,815
Schafer: Okay. Rice: Should be fun.

539
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:48,620
Kipnis: I would...I would vote against a public demo for now.

540
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,656
Schafer: What would we have at our booth, then, if we...just do a trailer?

541
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:52,658
Rice: Nothing. Schafer: What do you mean, nothing?

542
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:55,027
Rice: It'd mean we have no games at our booth right now.

543
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,495
Schafer: I mean, depends how we show it.

544
00:29:56,495 --> 00:30:00,432
Like, showing adventure games on the--on the-- like, at E3 and stuff was always a nightmare,

545
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:05,070
'cause, like, you can't get-- it's not like jumping into a mech and shooting a bunch of stuff, or even playing "Brütal Legend."

546
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:10,208
Like, so, you can't-- it's hard to really kind of-- I mean, now that we have-- that headphones are more common

547
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,044
and stuff, I think it's a little easier to demo them.

548
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:16,348
But you're still, like-- sitting there for a while being stuck on a puzzle is not something that's fun to do,

549
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:19,284
and people are lining up behind you to see the game.

550
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,254
Petty: The big problem with this whole thing, potentially, is that we're gonna disrupt all this--

551
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:25,223
we just spent all this effort getting everything into a flow

552
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:27,492
that's going to unblock our dependencies.

553
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:31,196
And so even doing any of this work is probably going to disrupt that somewhat.

554
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,365
It's hard to say how much until we look at that.

555
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:38,470
But, um, polishing the spaceship to beta right now, uh, I think would be the absolute worst thing,

556
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,707
because we have so much areas of the game that have issues we've gotta work through.

557
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:45,510
And people like myself and Bagel, some of the animators, need to stay out ahead

558
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,881
or we're gonna get exactly where we were, where everything's blocked up, and part of that happened

559
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,783
because of the last trailer we did.

560
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:54,353
I mean, obviously, there's an undeniable benefit.

561
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:58,223
It's hard to quantify the benefit, is always the issue with making these decisions, right?

562
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:03,562
'Cause, like, well, people get excited and that generates goodwill, but...

563
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:05,530
Schafer: Like, the two things that I want spoil each other.

564
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,101
Like, showing really meaty gameplay and not spoiling things are, like,

565
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:12,003
kinda mutually exclusive.

566
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,473
Rice: All right. This is all good stuff.

567
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:16,041
Schafer: Except you're doing the smile.

568
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,375
You're doing the "I'm really unhappy" smile.

569
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,445
Rice: No, I'm not! I, like-- Schafer: "Yeah, life's shit like I thought.

570
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:24,716
Yep, that's exactly what I thought life was like." Rice: No, I mean, I've always been about trying to, like,

571
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,252
figure out how we can do it without disrupting.

572
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:31,556
But, uh, now we just have to figure out what that means for our PAX plans, so...

573
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,558
Schafer: I mean, in the end it's not even about it being disrupting.

574
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,594
I really don't care about disrupting Lee at all.

575
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:37,129
I mean, it's really-- that does--no.

576
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:38,330
No, I mean, it's not even about that.

577
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,433
It's like, if we really felt like, oh man, it was such a juicy reward

578
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:45,470
at the end of it, like, if it was really, like, that demo would really turn people, like,

579
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:49,141
millions of people into fans of the game, like, I feel like it would be great.

580
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:53,145
But I feel like showing the spaceship to the press would not necessarily convert

581
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:56,114
a whole bunch of people, you know, um...

582
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,583
Petty: Well, that's what I meant by disruptive: Is it worth it?

583
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:02,854
Because like you said in the earlier episodes, no one cares how well a game is produced.

584
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:06,691
I don't think anyone cares how well a game is promoted if it comes out and it's not good.

585
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:10,829
Schafer: The one--at least the one discipline here that we can agree no one cares about is production.

586
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,098
Crook: You said both those things. Schafer: I don't remember saying that.

587
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,533
Petty: But, I mean, it's the same thing.

588
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:19,671
Like, good production/promotion, if it's not-- if we--you know, I want it to be as good as it can be.

589
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:23,475
Rice: It's just a hard--like, it became a lot more important with all the press shit that went down

590
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:27,012
'cause, like, now what does it look like, oh, suddenly we're taken off the floor map of PAX

591
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,481
and we pulled out of PAX? Like, that looks bad.

592
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:32,050
Schafer: That's 'cause I thought someone was gonna throw acid in my face.

593
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,820
You can say that: "Tim was worried about acid." Rice: But, yeah.

594
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,256
Petty: Okay, but then what if we showed a press demo that wasn't totally polished?

595
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,324
Which is worse?

596
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,026
Giving 'em ammo to hate on?

597
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:42,360
I think that's worse.

598
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,198
Schafer: Honestly, I--if I could do anything right now, it would just be sit out this PAX.

599
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:49,734
Rice: Yeah, we-- Schafer: I feel like we just don't-- Rice: I think we might have to if we don't do a demo.

600
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,603
Schafer: I don't know if-- can-can we, now?

601
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,605
Rice: We'd probably have to pay for some stuff.

602
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:56,341
Petty: We could have a kickass merch booth.

603
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,610
Rice: Uh, yeah...we could do that.

604
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:28,506
[Music] Bagel: Uh, I think it's going good.

605
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,308
It's pretty rad.

606
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:36,248
I think we've all, like, gotten a lot better at art, you know, over the last year.

607
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:42,287
So lookin' at all the old stuff is, like, kinda hard, but we all see stuff, I think, that we know we wanna change.

608
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:45,590
And, um, it's getting to an exciting time right now.

609
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:51,429
Uh, it's polish phase, you know, just figuring out what we're gonna polish and just lookin' back

610
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:59,804
at all of our old stuff and bringing it all together into an awesome game, you know?

611
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,473
But, yeah.

612
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,008
I feel like it's goin' pretty good.

613
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:08,780
Pretty exciting, but it is also super scary that we only have, like, what, four months left.

614
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:15,152
Right? But, yeah, I'm gonna go-- I'm goin' out to San Francisco on the 16th of September,

615
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:20,558
and, um, I'm gonna be out there for two weeks, and we are gonna, like, talk about polish,

616
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,795
figure out a plan, and then just start nailing it.

617
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:44,014
[Music] Schafer: We've got some professional voice in the game now.

618
00:34:44,014 --> 00:34:46,717
You can hear--uh, and it's awesome, 'cause they're good.

619
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,319
Black: Oh, my!

620
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,588
A fresh face rises from below.

621
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,590
Before you ask, let me answer.

622
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,793
Yes, you may live here in Meriloft forever.

623
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:59,030
Rice: Yeah, it's one of those things that, uh...

624
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:04,235
changes, uh, the production values of the game in a very short amount of time.

625
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:07,572
Like, 'cause it kind of all comes in at once, in one big chunk,

626
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:13,244
and suddenly you go from having very non-professional acting to very professional acting.

627
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,714
And it--and it just, uh...

628
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:19,050
I think it just reminds you it's real.

629
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,785
Schafer: A huge difference.

630
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,522
It's--it's huge. I mean, we've been looking at these temporary cut scenes for so long where

631
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:28,560
the characters are all moving-- 'cause they don't wanna put a lot of work into it until they have the final VO.

632
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,795
Now that we have the final VO, they can just go to town.

633
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,499
And so we're gonna see, um, a whole different game experience

634
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,135
where it just feels so much more polished.

635
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:43,274
Rice: And in a game that's so much about character and story, um, like, it's gonna be really important

636
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:47,679
that that is sold correctly and those actors are selling it right.

637
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:52,250
So, you know, Tim's an awesome writer, and now to have, like, people who are able

638
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:58,423
to take what he wrote and, like, even make it better is pretty amazing.

639
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:01,826
Schafer: And "Act 1" of our game is now in alpha, which is exciting.

640
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,128
[Offscreen] Woo! And--woo!

641
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,829
But it's lookin' good.

642
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,464
Rice: Cheers.

643
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:26,384
[Music] Schafer: It's gonna be fun when we can actually, um,

644
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:29,254
celebrate, you know, shipping.

645
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:34,092
And--but it'll be kind of sad, 'cause it's been kind of fun to do all this and...

646
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:43,101
[Music] I'm not gonna celebrate till the whole thing ships.

647
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:47,005
I suppose we'll have some sort of celebration on shipping "Act 1."

648
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:48,707
Then I'm like, don't talk to me until it's done.

649
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:53,344
April/May. April/M-- Definitely between April and November.

650
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,280
Depends on how many the first act sells.

651
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,583
If it sells a lot, we'll just go all the way into 2016.

652
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,187
Just kidding.

653
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:46,297
[Music] Kaufman: Okay, that's all we can do.

654
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,099
We're pulling out.

655
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:52,203
Don't make the same mistake you did last time, boy.

656
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:53,738
I-I don't understand.

657
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,341
What is it about this creature?

658
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,512
Brown: Excellent.

659
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:04,282
Schafer: Let's throw in for the fans-- edit together the lines to make a big dirty, like,

660
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,117
"Spock and Kirk having sex" video.

661
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:10,054
I like to put stuff in there for them.

662
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:14,859
"Pull out now, boy." Brown: I just...

663
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,596
Schafer: "Think about baseball."
